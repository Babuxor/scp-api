Black hair, brown eyes, and 1.83m (6ft) tall. Most often wears unremarkable clothing. Subject has identified himself by the name \"Duke\", however he does not mind being called SCP-083 or simply eighty-three by personnel. He spends most of his time wandering the grounds of Site \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, or in the recreation room, making conversation with the staff.</p>\n<p>SCP-083 has no physical need to eat, although he often orders food. He seems to prefer meat, and several commonly known brands of confectionery have been ordered. Subject has no need to sleep either, but still requested a bed for his containment area. When asked about this, he replied \"I feel like laying down sometimes, I don't think that there is anything unusual about that.\"</p>\n<p>Staff interacting with SCP-083 have often reporting him as \"genial\" and \"polite\" to the majority of the staff, although some of the female staff have reported him to human resources for numerous counts of sexual harassment. This behavior is to be strongly discouraged, and if complaints persist, he is to be locked in his containment area permanently.</p>\n<p>When tested for intelligence with a standard IQ exam, he scored over 155, and has displayed remarkable logic and problem solving skills, even being the cause of several breakthroughs with SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588, SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588, and SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588. When questioned about his existence prior to capture by SCP, he often claims to remember many historical events, the earliest being the execution of John Rogers in 1555. He claims to have seen [DATA EXPUNGED].</p>\n<p>If SCP-083 is not fed blood every twelve hours, subject will become highly enraged and aggressive, attempting to break out of his containment (The sole successful attempt resulted in 11 staff fatalities). This seems to be a sort of self preservation instinct, much like that of an animal deprived of food, only on a much greater scale. When in this state, SCP-083 will actively seek out humans, and attempt to feed off of them. Subject can only be pacified if he can find a human fitting his standards for blood. See document 083-ABO-C. When he finds a satisfactory food source, subject will become cannibalistic, completely consuming it if it is human, or, if the blood is found in a pack, he will merely drain it. Upon sating his hunger, subject falls into a comatose state for roughly twelve hours, and the feeding schedule must be re-centered around this new cycle.</p>\n<p>When questioned about these rages, he claims to have no memory, and refuses to speak of it, at one occasion even becoming violent. When submitted to a polygraph test [DATA EXPUNGED]</p>\n<p>SCP-083 seems to have a regenerative property similar to that of <a href=\"/scp-076\">SCP-076</a>, and will regenerate even upon apparent \"death\".</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> Those with Level 2 Security Clearance should see documents 083-ABO-C, and document 25-083-076</p>\n<p><strong>Document 083-ABO-C:</strong> [Experiment C: Blood]</p>\n<p>In this test SCP-083 was given several different kinds of blood, without his knowledge.</p>\n<p><strong>Given:</strong>Blood type O. <strong>Reaction:</strong> Became enraged, subsequently given \"normal\" blood dosage.</p>\n<p><strong>Given:</strong>Blood from a non-virgin. <strong>Reaction:</strong> Became enraged, subsequently given \"normal\" blood dosage.</p>\n<p><strong>Given:</strong>Blood from a male virgin <strong>Reaction:</strong> SCP-083 looked around confused. Looked directly into the security camera, and scowled, as though he were the victim of a practical joke. Drank the rest of the blood with no ill effects.

The containment area is to be furnished however SCP-083 requests as long as his requests do not violate standard SCP containment procedure.-- \n\n\n\n--Guests are permitted to SCP-083's containment area between the hours of 1100 and 1400. However, please note that all female staff are advised not to develop an emotional attachment to SCP-083. If you feel as though you are becoming emotionally attached, please contact one of the psychologists on staff immediately. We would also like to remind Ms.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Ms. \u2588\u2588\u2588 and Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 that there are several cameras in SCP-083's containment area.--\n\n\n\n--Every day at 0847 hours and 2047 hours, a single blood pack containing type A, B, or AB- blood from a virgin, female, human is to be placed within SCP-083's containment area after which, the containment area must be sealed for at least an hour. Failure to do this once will result in the termination of the entire staff assigned to SCP-083. In the event that SCP-083 is not fed, evacuation procedure 083-A is to be enacted immediately.--\n\n\n\n--SCP-083 has shown no intention of escaping, and claims \"I like it here, I get damn near everything I want.\" However, subject has shown increasing interest in several of the other SCPs on Site \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. It is advised by Doctor \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 that he should not be allowed in other SCP containment areas for security reasons.-- See Addendum 083-D-1.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Description:**\n\n\n\nSCP-083 appears to be a Caucasian male aged between twenty and twenty-six. Black hair, brown eyes, and 1.83m (6ft) tall. Most often wears unremarkable clothing. Subject has identified himself by the name \"Duke\", however he does not mind being called SCP-083 or simply eighty-three by personnel. He spends most of his time wandering the grounds of Site \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, or in the recreation room, making conversation with the staff.\n\n\n\nSCP-083 has no physical need to eat, although he often orders food.\u00a0\u00a0He seems to prefer meat, and several commonly known brands of confectionery have been ordered. Subject has no need to sleep either, but still requested a bed for his containment area. When asked about this, he replied \"I feel like laying down sometimes, I don't think that there is anything unusual about that.\"\n\n\n\nStaff interacting with SCP-083 have often reporting him as \"genial\" and \"polite\" to the majority of the staff, although some of the female staff have reported him to human resources for numerous counts of sexual harassment. This behavior is to be strongly discouraged, and if complaints persist, he is to be locked in his containment area permanently.\n\n\n\nWhen tested for intelligence with a standard IQ exam, he scored over 155, and has displayed remarkable logic and problem solving skills, even being the cause of several breakthroughs with SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588, SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588, and SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588. When questioned about his existence prior to capture by SCP, he often claims to remember many historical events, the earliest being the execution of John Rogers in 1555. He claims to have seen [DATA EXPUNGED].\n\n\n\nIf SCP-083 is not fed blood every twelve hours, subject will become highly enraged and aggressive, attempting to break out of his containment (The sole successful attempt resulted in 11 staff fatalities). This seems to be a sort of self preservation instinct, much like that of an animal deprived of food, only on a much greater scale. When in this state, SCP-083 will actively seek out humans, and attempt to feed off of them. Subject can only be pacified if he can find a human fitting his standards for blood. See document 083-ABO-C. When he finds a satisfactory food source, subject will become cannibalistic, completely consuming it if it is human, or, if the blood is found in a pack, he will merely drain it. Upon sating his hunger, subject falls into a comatose state for roughly twelve hours, and the feeding schedule must be re-centered around this new cycle.\n\n\n\nWhen questioned about these rages, he claims to have no memory, and refuses to speak of it, at one occasion even becoming violent. When submitted to a polygraph test [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n\n\nSCP-083 seems to have a regenerative property similar to that of [[[SCP-076]]], and will regenerate even upon apparent \"death\".\n\n\n\n\n\n**Addendum:** Those with Level 2 Security Clearance should see documents 083-ABO-C, and document 25-083-076\n\n\n\n\n\n**Document 083-ABO-C:** [Experiment C: Blood]\n\n\n\nIn this test SCP-083 was given several different kinds of blood, without his knowledge.\n\n\n\n**Given:**Blood type O. **Reaction:** Became enraged, subsequently given \"normal\" blood dosage.\n\n\n\n**Given:**Blood from a non-virgin. **Reaction:** Became enraged, subsequently given \"normal\" blood dosage.\n\n\n\n**Given:**Blood from a male virgin **Reaction:** SCP-083 looked around confused. Looked directly into the security camera, and scowled, as though he were the victim of a practical joke. Drank the rest of the blood with no ill effects. This is still not recommended, as SCP-083 becomes sullen and withdrawn until his next feeding. \n\n\n\n**Given** Blood from a rape victim who, otherwise, was a virgin. **Reaction:**[DATA EXPUNGED] Those with level 4 security clearance, please see document 25-083-076\n\n\n\n\n\n**Document 25-083-076** At Containment-Area 25 by the means of the blood given to him in test 083-C, subject became immediately enraged, displaying a level of anger previously unrecorded. Subject proceeded to break out of his containment area, which unfortunately coincided with [[[SCP-076]]]-2 showing signs of movement. When SCP-076-2 became active security personnel were unable to deal with both threats, and the containment situation on SCP-076-2 AND SCP-083 failed, prompting high command to send reinforcements.\n\n\n\nDuring this time, [DATA EXPUNGED], allowing SCP-083 to find a suitable source of food Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, who was promptly killed and consumed.

SCP-151 has agreed to wear a tracking device to help prevent contact with personnel convicted of violent crime towards women and/or children, whom it responds to with extreme violence, usually resulting in significant collateral damage.\n\n\n\n**Document 028/005/150/040/151:** Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was exposed to [[[SCP-028]]], but displayed no effects. Two days later Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 acquired [[[SCP-005]]] and used it to acquire [[[SCP-150]]], then made his way to [[[SCP-040]]]'s chamber. Upon Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's entering the chamber, [[[SCP-040]]] reacted, and Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was transformed into [DATA EXPUNGED]. Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (now classified as SCP-151) left [[[SCP-005]]] and [[[SCP-150]]] in [[[SCP-040]]]'s chamber and proceeded to leave the compound. Though not met with violence from SCP-151, all attempts at containment failed. Whereabouts of SCP-151 are currently unknown. SCP-151 constitutes a significant risk to both the secrecy and the containment of all other SCPs. It is recommended that it be apprehended/terminated at all costs.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 151-01:** Mobile Task Force Omega-7 (Pandora's Box) is currently tracking SCP-151, but has yet to make contact.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 151-02:** Mobile Task Force Omega-7 encountered SCP-151 on \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. SCP-151 rendered all members of the task force unconscious except for [[[SCP-076]]]-2, who he challenged to a game of Go, creating [[[SCP-152]]]. The game ended in a draw, and after the other members of the task force regained consciousness, SCP-151 was escorted back to the facility for questioning.\n\n\n\n**Document 151-A:** Interview with Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n> **Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:** \"So, Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, care to explain your actions?\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0**SCP-151:** \"K.\"\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0**Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:** ...\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0**Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:** \"Well?\"\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0**SCP-151:** \"K.\"\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0**Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:** \"I beg your pardon?\"\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0**SCP-151:** \"Please refer to me as K.\"\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0**Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:** \"Why K?\"\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0**SCP-151:** \"It is the closest analog you have to the first letter of my name.\"\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0**Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:** \"According to these records, Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, none of your names begin with that letter.\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0**SCP-151:** \"I am not Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, he was just the unlucky soul who fit into my plan.\"\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0**Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:** \"And what plan was that?\"\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0**SCP-151:** \"Wait until someone with access to the necessary objects used\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0SCP-028, and gained access to knowledge esoteric and vague enough that it\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0would not be noticed initially.

There has been no testing on this artifact by the Foundation to date.</p>\n<p>Proposed containment procedures involve either the construction of an elaborate and ever-changing maze such as the mythological maze of Crete, traditional containment procedures such as those commonly implemented in Armed Bio-Containment Area-14, or destruction of the artifact.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> Research indicates that someone attempted to contain a large creature in Vancouver, British Columbia on 27 April \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Much of the evidence of this event has been intentionally obscured by parties unknown, but what has been determined is that the large creature was roughly humanoid with distinct moose-like features. The creature was described in a wide range of attributes, as with many cryptids, although all reports indicate the creature is bipedal with two arms, moose-like antlers, and a towering stature.</p>\n<p>The attempt to contain the creature in a Vancouver warehouse failed, and the creature escaped onto the city streets. Over fifty-million dollars (Canadian) in property damages were caused by the creature. Among those destroyed were a small local bank, a sixteen-wheel truck, and miles of paved street.</p>\n<p>Since then there has been a persistent level of sightings of the creature as it moves southward. On 4 May \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 the creature was sighted near the interstate at the Bellis Fair Mall in Bellingham, Washington by a student at Western Washington University. Two days later it was spotted in Kent, Washington and only hours later near southern Seattle. It continued this pattern until it reached Portland, Oregon. Since then sightings have ceased.</p>\n<p><strong>Note from General Bowe:</strong> The capture of this creature has been put on high priority by my office, as a mandate of our continued support of the Foundation. Not only does SCP-269-D represent a grave threat to the American public, but it may provide insight into Canadian SCP operations, if any.</p>\n<p><strong>Attached from FBI File 889:</strong><br/>\nThe Unusual Incidents Unit has reported minimal findings. Their interviews with eyewitnesses were inconclusive, and provided as much insight into the \"B.C. Moose Man\" as they did Bigfoot. No human intelligence survey has found anything of value concerning this phenomenon. Each interviewee expressed high anxiety levels and a desire not to speak with us, in spite of their previous willingness to.</p>\n<p>There is, however, significant forensic evidence. In spite of reassurances granted to me by the commissioner of the Mounted Police, Canadian authorities were not forthcoming about the incident. The event has also garnered little media attention. It is not in the Canadian national character to cover up incidents of violence in a major metropolis, though my recent visit to Vancouver gave me palpable evidence of physical devastation.

There has been no testing on this artifact by the Foundation to date.\n\n\n\nProposed containment procedures involve either the construction of an elaborate and ever-changing maze such as the mythological maze of Crete, traditional containment procedures such as those commonly implemented in Armed Bio-Containment Area-14, or destruction of the artifact. \n\n\n\n**Description:** Research indicates that someone attempted to contain a large creature in Vancouver, British Columbia on 27 April \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Much of the evidence of this event has been intentionally obscured by parties unknown, but what has been determined is that the large creature was roughly humanoid with distinct moose-like features. The creature was described in a wide range of attributes, as with many cryptids, although all reports indicate the creature is bipedal with two arms, moose-like antlers, and a towering stature.\n\n\n\nThe attempt to contain the creature in a Vancouver warehouse failed, and the creature escaped onto the city streets. Over fifty-million dollars (Canadian) in property damages were caused by the creature. Among those destroyed were a small local bank, a sixteen-wheel truck, and miles of paved street.\n\n\n\nSince then there has been a persistent level of sightings of the creature as it moves southward. On 4 May \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 the creature was sighted near the interstate at the Bellis Fair Mall in Bellingham, Washington by a student at Western Washington University. Two days later it was spotted in Kent, Washington and only hours later near southern Seattle. It continued this pattern until it reached Portland, Oregon. Since then sightings have ceased.\n\n\n\n**Note from General Bowe:** The capture of this creature has been put on high priority by my office, as a mandate of our continued support of the Foundation. Not only does SCP-269-D represent a grave threat to the American public, but it may provide insight into Canadian SCP operations, if any.\n\n\n\n**Attached from FBI File 889:**\n\nThe Unusual Incidents Unit has reported minimal findings. Their interviews with eyewitnesses were inconclusive, and provided as much insight into the \"B.C. Moose Man\" as they did Bigfoot. No human intelligence survey has found anything of value concerning this phenomenon. Each interviewee expressed high anxiety levels and a desire not to speak with us, in spite of their previous willingness to.\n\n\n\nThere is, however, significant forensic evidence. In spite of reassurances granted to me by the commissioner of the Mounted Police, Canadian authorities were not forthcoming about the incident. The event has also garnered little media attention. It is not in the Canadian national character to cover up incidents of violence in a major metropolis, though my recent visit to Vancouver gave me palpable evidence of physical devastation. The FBI has gathered photographs of the incident's aftermath, showing the wreckage of vehicles, buildings, and city streets. The force required to wreak that much carnage without explosives is matched only by the force of hurricanes.\n\n\n\nIt is my belief that there is a force actively preventing our investigation. Someone or some thing is preventing inter-jurisdictional communication, minimizing forensic evidence available to us, and coercing our witnesses not to discuss the incident with us.\n\n\n\n[Compiled with the aid of rogue agent [[[Bijhan]]] ]\n\n\n\n**Addendum SCP-269-D-Theta**:\n\n\n\nSCP-269-D has been classified as [http://www.scp-wiki.net/termination-report-269 decommissioned].

He usually wears a pair of denim blue jeans, a black cotton shirt with the sleeves torn off, a pair of welder's goggles, which are worn either on his eyes or on top of his head simply for fashion effect, and his hair back in a ponytail. SPC-316 prefers the name \"Dyne\", and has frequently told personnel interacting with him that his title is \"Dyne the Unfettered\" or, upon uncommon occasions, in which the subject becomes slightly depressed, \"Dyne the Forgotten Hero\". His attitude has been commonly referred to by personnel as \"charming\", \"vibrant\", and \"enthusiastic\".

APPROVED</p>\n<p>Subject is, or seems to be, a Caucasian male between the ages of 19-24 with blond hair and blue eyes, approximately 6 ft tall and weighing roughly 200 lbs. Dr.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and Dr.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 estimate the subjects mental age about 13-16 years of age, possibly the reason for his easy emotional agitation. Due to subjects nature, all staff interacting with subject must be friendly and outgoing and never respond in the negative to a request. Violation of this will not be punishable by high command, as subject's reaction will most certainly prevent a second occurrence if staff member in question is still alive. We know the subject is aware of its capability's but has stated that it cannot keep them under control when under stress. Due to high emotional instability of subject, psycho analysis is all but impossible, with sessions quickly becoming violent as soon as subject is asked about something it does not enjoy thinking/talking about, which seems to include all subjects relevant to psycho analysis.</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong>:<br/>\nSubject seems to have the ability to affect and alter the universe by will alone. As of now no knowledge of how this is possible has been gained, but we do know that the subjects moods seem to be the main form of control he has over the abilities. Around the subject the laws of physics seem to break down. Objects in his vicinity will slightly levitate or begin to pass through solid matter, and occasionally teleport, usually switching places with another object in the vicinity of the subject. This seems to only happen to objects that are not the subjects center of attention at that moment. If subject is in good will, and everything that can be done to keep him that way is to be done, staff around him report feelings of euphoria and elation.</p>\n<p>All bruises, cuts or injuries not only seem to heal but vanish as if they were never there, even scars will fade. So far these changes have persisted after person(s) have been removed from subjects vicinity and even after subject undergoes a mood swing. Subject has shown limited control over these abilities, usually moving things telekinetically rather than by hand. If subject becomes agitated, persons near him will begin to feel depressed, irrational, violent and even suicidal depending on the intensity of the subjects mood swing. During the worst of these swings, objects/persons in subjects vicinity will age/decay rapidly if the subject is depressed, when angered, things will spontaneously char and catch fire and red energy will emanate from subjects body. Living things caught in this energy seem to have all the life energy sucked out of them. Thermal images show their body heat literally being \"sucked\" out of whatever body part is closest to subject. Autopsies of these individuals show now cause of death we are currently able to detect. Since his containment in 19\u2588\u2588, subject has shown an increase in his control over his abilities, and also has not aged at all. Current procedures are not for subjects containment, but for protection of staff on Site \u2588\u2588, as Subject is contained willingly, going only as far as to say that he knows he is dangerous if he loses control and has no desire to accidentally hurt anyone else. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 wanted to inquire further but noticed tears on subjects cheeks and that subject seemed to be concentrating extremely hard, presumably to prevent his abilities from manifesting. No questions about the subjects past are to be asked under any circumstances, if the subject brings it up (which has never happened), change the subject of conversation immediately.</p>\n<p><strong>Document #982-a</strong>: As stated, SCP-531 will have drastically different effects on its surrounding based on its moods. Aside from the aforementioned affects, the following have been documented:</p>\n<p>Sorrow: On December \u2588\u2588th, 19\u2588\u2588, at approximately 1400 hours, the subject paused mid sentence and cocked its head to one side and seemed to enter a trance for several minutes. No outside stimuli seemed to affect him. After emerging from said trance, subject began weeping, screaming between sobs that he \"could no longer feel his mother\" and \"she's dead\".</p>\n<p>Security footage shows that with each sob, subject would emit a wave of black energy in all directions. These waves seemed to disintegrate all forms of organic matter at the sub-atomic level, leaving inorganic things unharmed. At the time, subject was eating with staff in the mess hall. All persons in the hall were killed instantly, as were all persons within a radius of approximately 1/2 mile from subject, resulting in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 casualties. It is unknown if this radius of effect was caused by the walls of the facility blocking the waves propagation in some way or if that is their natural range. Remote access to security cameras and intercom system enabled high command to communicate with subject remotely. After several hours subject calmed down the the waves ceased. For the following weeks, subject demonstrated effects similar to SCP-073, causing all plant matter coming into its vicinity to decay rapidly, but for unknown reasons animals, including humans, were not affected as they usually are when subject is in a similar state.</p>\n<p>Jealousy: Recently, subject has realized staff protocols regarding responding to its requests in the negative and has begun to use this to engage in sexual activity with female staff members. Surprisingly, many of them are not only okay with this but sometimes instigate sexual activity themselves. As stated before, when the subject is happy, those around him will be as well. Obviously sexual encounters with the subject create a more euphoric state than would be possible with any normal human partner.</p>\n<p>However, on November \u2588\u2588th, 20\u2588\u2588, Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 who had been intimately involved with subject despite being married was seen by subject meeting with her husband in the mess hall. When he saw them kiss, subjects entire eyes turned black. Objects in his vicinity not only began levitating but flying around, emitting orange or green light and disintegrating. Subject raised his hand as if grabbing someone by the throat, and Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's husband raised off the floor, obviously choking. At this point, the entire facility began to vibrate and staff who were able to see subject reported him \"going in and out of focus\" despite objects near him appearing normal. Subject shot a blue green \"flame\" from his palm which engulfed Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's husband, who began to age very rapidly. Thermal security cameras showed a similar effect to the energy emanating from the subject when angry. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's screamed at this point, when the subject heard this his eyes returned to normal color and subject passed out.</p>\n<p>Subject claims to have no memory of the incident, and was appalled when shown security footage of it. Has stated that it wants its deepest apologies sent to Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and her husband, who now appears to be 15 years older. Subject has stated that it would like an opportunity to attempt to reverse the effects of the incident. When questioned on how it would accomplish this, subject said that he \"did not know how, but I know that I can\". It seems that even the slightest alterations in the intensity/type of mood subject is in result in wholly different abilities manifesting. Due to the very short containment period of subject, only since \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, it is possible the subject may have a near infinite number of abilities. Subjects mental immaturity seems to be the only thing preventing control of the abilities, since in the above mentioned incident, subject seemed to know exactly what it was doing while in the \"trance\". Possibility of having class D personnel attempt to harm subject to test potential reactions in a combat scenario. Request is pending, currently weighing the massive loss of life this would entail compared to the benefits of having subject in control of abilities.</p>\n<p>High Command has issued a statement that while the potential risk is great, the benefits of keeping the subject happy outweigh the dangers of possible random mood swings. Also due to the healing nature of the subject while in an euphoric state, the possible benefits to the foundation could be substantial, especially concerning the loss of life with more malicious SCP's such as SCP-682. They are currently formulating new protocols to prevent a recurrence, and currently have declared that female personnel may only engage in sexual activity with subject if they have already been debriefed and agree not to have any contact of any form from males while on site.</p>\n<p>Considering possibility of medically inducing subject into a coma to maintain him in a euphoric mind state, more research into effects of medicine on subject must be done first, risk of subject having nightmares must also be considered.</p>\n<p><strong>TERMINATED:</strong> See <a href=\"/termination-order\">Termination Report for SCP 531</a></p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/decomm:scp-531-d\">SCP-531-D</a>\" by Unknown Author, from the <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

To date, it has requested:\n\n-One Cat (short haired tabby who subject simply calls \"Baby\") APPROVED\n\n-Television with cable APPROVED\n\n-one Xbox 360 with virtually all games for it APPROVED\n\n-A refrigerator to be stocked with food and drinks of subjects choosing (exception: No Alcohol) APPROVED\n\n-One laptop with internet access DENIED\n\n-Laptop with all internal parts capable of internet access removed APPROVED\n\n-Subject has also requested internet access solely for Xbox live, subject seems to enjoy shooting games (specifically Gears of War and Call of Duty 4) and wants to be able to play online PENDING (since subjects computer is incapable of internet access, this may not violate protocol)\n\n-One Dean Flying V guitar w/ marshal amp and various accessories including: 1 Crybaby Wah pedal, 1 Chromatic guitar tuner, 1 capo, and enough cords to be able to use these. APPROVED\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Subject is, or seems to be, a Caucasian male between the ages of 19-24 with blond hair and blue eyes, approximately 6 ft tall and weighing roughly 200 lbs. Dr.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and Dr.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 estimate the subjects mental age about 13-16 years of age, possibly the reason for his easy emotional agitation. Due to subjects nature, all staff interacting with subject must be friendly and outgoing and never respond in the negative to a request. Violation of this will not be punishable by high command, as subject's reaction will most certainly prevent a second occurrence if staff member in question is still alive. We know the subject is aware of its capability's but has stated that it cannot keep them under control when under stress. Due to high emotional instability of subject, psycho analysis is all but impossible, with sessions quickly becoming violent as soon as subject is asked about something it does not enjoy thinking/talking about, which seems to include all subjects relevant to psycho analysis.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0**Description**: \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Subject seems to have the ability to affect and alter the universe by will alone. As of now no knowledge of how this is possible has been gained, but we do know that the subjects moods seem to be the main form of control he has over the abilities. Around the subject the laws of physics seem to break down. Objects in his vicinity will slightly levitate or begin to pass through solid matter, and occasionally teleport, usually switching places with another object in the vicinity of the subject. This seems to only happen to objects that are not the subjects center of attention at that moment. If subject is in good will, and everything that can be done to keep him that way is to be done, staff around him report feelings of euphoria and elation. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAll bruises, cuts or injuries not only seem to heal but vanish as if they were never there, even scars will fade. So far these changes have persisted after person(s) have been removed from subjects vicinity and even after subject undergoes a mood swing. Subject has shown limited control over these abilities, usually moving things telekinetically rather than by hand. If subject becomes agitated, persons near him will begin to feel depressed, irrational, violent and even suicidal depending on the intensity of the subjects mood swing. During the worst of these swings, objects/persons in subjects vicinity will age/decay rapidly if the subject is depressed, when angered, things will spontaneously char and catch fire and red energy will emanate from subjects body. Living things caught in this energy seem to have all the life energy sucked out of them. Thermal images show their body heat literally being \"sucked\" out of whatever body part is closest to subject. Autopsies of these individuals show now cause of death we are currently able to detect. Since his containment in 19\u2588\u2588, subject has shown an increase in his control over his abilities, and also has not aged at all. Current procedures are not for subjects containment, but for protection of staff on Site \u2588\u2588, as Subject is contained willingly, going only as far as to say that he knows he is dangerous if he loses control and has no desire to accidentally hurt anyone else. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 wanted to inquire further but noticed tears on subjects cheeks and that subject seemed to be concentrating extremely hard, presumably to prevent his abilities from manifesting. No questions about the subjects past are to be asked under any circumstances, if the subject brings it up (which has never happened), change the subject of conversation immediately.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0**Document #982-a**: As stated, SCP-531 will have drastically different effects on its surrounding based on its moods.

The door is also to be made out of the same materials and can only be opened from the outside. SCP-547's containment is only done as precaution, as subject has shown no real hostility or desire to destroy to the staff other than in testing sessions of SCP-547's capabilities. Subject is to recieve any basic human furnishings on request and if given permission by Dr.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Dr.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, or O5-\u2588\u2588, SCP-547 may be allowed a television and a gaming system of his choice for up 12 hours at a time.</p>\n<p>SCP-547 is to be constantly be surrounded in almost any form of music, with the exception of Hip Hop/Rap due to an increased show of anger and hostility when playing. Any song that subject requests is to be played as soon as possible. SCP-547's containment cell also acts as a partial buffer, allowing additional time for personnel to evacuate, should SCP-547's normal behavioral patterns fluctuate beyond simple emotions and subject begins to go into the fetal position. All personnel in containment facility are to be evacuated immediately and facility locked down for at least 2 weeks.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-547 appears to be a young, muscular Caucasian male in his late teenage years. Subject is 2m (6'3\") and weighs 85kg (190 lbs.). Since original encounter with SCP-547 in Austria near the small village of in 17\u2588\u2588, subject appears to have not aged at all. MRI and X-Ray reveal SCP-547's body to be completely human with the exception of where subject's heart would be. After much convincing, SCP-547 was given an autopsy, where surgeons discovered a pure white ball of energy 10x10\u00a0cm (4 in) and arteries and veins leading from it in the center of subject's chest.</p>\n<p>Once again with much persuasion to SCP-547, temporary removal of ball was performed. Attempted removal of this object proved very difficult, as one surgeon tried to touch it, his entire body was completely vaporized. Eventually a robot arm was used to remove glowing orb. As soon as this object left SCP-547's body, all organ and brain functions ceased instantly. Due to this shocking development, the surgeons quickly put the glowing orb back, and all of SCP-547's bodily functions and brain patterns resumed instantly. Several tests have been done on SCp-547's \"heart\" and all have revealed any and all organic matter that comes into physical contact with subject's orb are instantly vaporized to nothing.</p>\n<p>Once the autopsy was concluded, SCP-547 left the facility to go outside before his opening could be stitched. Armed personnel attempted to stop subject but all resistance against SCP-547 was crushed non-lethally and subdued by subject. After getting outside the facility, subject simply took some dirt from the ground and rubbed the soil into the wound, completely healing the wound in a matter of seconds. SCP-547 then returned to containment cell and refused all requests of interviews for several days.</p>\n<p>Whilst in an \"idle\" position, subject's features are fairly normal; pale skin, dark green eyes, and sharp features that exhibit a handsome young man. Subject's hair whilst \"idle\" is black and generally slicked back, keeping most of the hair out of his face. IQ tests reveal that SCP-547's IQ is around 140, despite his somewhat carefree attitude. In all aspects, SCP-547 acts as a normal teenage boy, showing keen interest in women, and often displaying an acute sense of sarcasm and a charming nature when engaging with observing personnel.</p>\n<p>On each of the subjects limbs are pieces of black armor, made out of an unknown metal. On his right and left hands are two metal black gauntlets that run halfway up both forearms. Upon his feet are two boots made of the same unknown metal that come to mid-calf. All attempts to remove these pieces of armor from subject have failed, it appears only SCP-547 can remove these objects from his body at any time. Recorded tests have shown that each piece of armor that the subject wears has a certain elemental trait to it, his right glove having the power of fire, his left having control of electricity, his left boot being able to conjure and control massive amounts of water, and his right being able to create massive tremors and shatter all known sediments. It has also been noted that when any of these elemental powers are activated, the corresponding piece of armor becomes encased with the element being used and also appears to augment SCP-547's physical abilities.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Right Gauntlet: Becomes encased in fire and appears to give SCP-547 limited flight. Subject's eyes become glowing red like embers and hair becomes a living flame.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Left Gauntlet: Bolts of blue lightning appear to wrap around the glove and augment 547's speed, giving him amazing movement ability that has been recorded up to 200 mph and physical strikes with his body at over 50 times in one second. Hair becomes extremely spiky and yellow and eyes glow blue whilst sparks of electricity shoot out from pupils.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Left Boot: Is surrounded by bluish water that appears to be from the sea. Subject then gains the extraordinary ability to turn whole being into water, making him virtually invincible to all physical attacks. Hair whilst in a solid state of being is deep blue and appears constantly soaked in a liquid that has yet to be identified. Pupils appear to be waves of the ocean.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Right Boot: Becomes completely encased in solid granite and gives SCP-547 incredible strength and hardens skin immensely. Hair and eyes become a deep brown.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Until modern day headphones and more suitable means of playing music were developed, containment and even submission of SCP-547 was near impossible, for his destructive capabilities and strange regeneration abilities through use of the environment made subject's capture extremely difficult. By coincidence, as SCP-547 was about to rip through yet another task force sent out to subdue subject, one agent had left the radio on in one of the transports, playing \"\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\" by the band \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Upon hearing the music, SCP-547's rampage stopped abruptly as he continued to listen to the song. After the song finished, subject turned himself in gladly under the condition that he be allowed to listen to the music. Really hating that he had to stoop this low, Agent Infred talked 547 into handing over his boots and gauntlets. Infred crossed himself, and made a comment about 'the ends justifying the means.'</p>\n<p>After originally being contained in Site \u2588\u2588, subject was then moved to Site \u2588\u2588 after Incident [DATA EXPUNGED]</p>\n<p>Original containment cell was constantly filled with classic rock of the current time such as \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and many others. As the current music changed and grew into many different genres, 547's tastes expanded as well, enveloping many different styles of music, with the exception of rap and hip hop. When finally contained and observed, SCP-547 admitted to only being able to speak English after hearing \"\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\" in his capture. After much brainstorming, several scientists gave SCP-547 Latin music, and after listening to several different songs in Portuguese and Spanish, subject was fluent in both. From this point on, subject has listened to music in over 20 different languages and fluently spoke and understood all after engaging in region's music.</p>\n<p>SCP-547 claims to have an actual name, \"but cannot remember at the moment\" when asked to identify itself. Often, SCP-547 will request being addressed by its current favorite band name. Currently, it is calling itself Muse and asks all personnel to address him by the band name. It has been observed that SCP-547 also displays very limited telepathy, ironically this only applies to music and the elements of nature. He claims he knows when he wants a new song, and can identify it lyrically despite never hearing the tune before. It is recommended but not required that all D-Personnel have some familiarity in today's pop music. All observing scientists and O5-\u2588\u2588 are to be constantly brought up to date upon SCP-547's current music tastes and most recently recorded abilities in the field.</p>\n<p>SCP-547 other telepathic skill is that to actually communicate with nature. Subject claims he can feel the earth around him, and with his own powers, can heal whatever damage may be inflicted; either in the air, water, or the ground. Personnel have said after being in the facility housing SCP-547, the air and water around them feels new and fresh. Subject claims to be responsible for renewing the environment, though he does this cleaning process subconsciously. Rejuvenation of damaged environments, either by natural causes or human means require SCP-547's more individual attention and focus. Several proposals have been made that SCP-547 be used to restore the rain forests of Brazil or clean up oil spills in various parts of the ocean.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 547-01:</strong> After removal of SCP-547's armor, several tests were conducted on the objects along with SCP-547's abilities without the armor on. Subject's abilities are much more powerful and uncontrollable. SCP-547 still can activate these powers at will, but they are no longer restricted to each limb and cannot be formed or aimed, simply being shot out in massive bursts of the respective element. Study of the gloves and boots concludes that they act as conduits that control the elements created by SCP-547.</p>\n<p>It is absolutely imperative that only SCP-547 be allowed to wear these items, as any other human who dons these objects will be brutally killed by various means depending on the item worn. Class D personnel who have worn the right gauntlet instantly burst in flames, quickly incinerating the body in a matter of seconds. When wearing the left glove, subject becomes electrocuted, eventually causing the heart to burst. The left boot causes the wearer's lungs to become completely filled with water, effectively drowning them in a few seconds. The right boot causes massive hemorrhaging of all organs, personnel quickly dying in a minute or less due to major loss of blood. These affects only apply to humans as all tests have shown no affect on animals of any species.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 547-02:</strong> SCP-547 is extremely social and most often will always agree to either a chat about various music or an interview with personnel above Level 3 or any O5 director, however SCP-547 has dodged or simply refused to answer all questions regarding his past and how old he truly is.</p>\n<p>SCP-547 shows particular interest in <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-076\">SCP-076</a> after being allowed limited viewing of other SCP files. SCP-547 wishes to have a \"sparring match\" against SCP-076-02 to see who could beat the other. Due to the destructive nature of both and the catastrophe that could result from such powerful SCPs clashing, all ideas of said fight have been put on hold and put under heavy scrutiny, with Command currently debating the true research potential of both fighting and also the heavy risk of major loss of both environmental and human life. Subject has also recently expressed interest similar to that of <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-213\">SCP-213</a> despite never being presented any file information or verbal instruction. SCP-547's full psychic abilities are believed to yet be recorded, further study shall be conducted.</p>\n<p>SCP-547 also has expressed a great desire to fight and kill <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-517\">SCP-517</a> and <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-682\">SCP-682</a>. In this interview, O5-\u2588\u2588 spoke to SCP-547 through video feed while two Class D Personnel maintained technical apparatus.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>\n<p>O5-\u2588\u2588: SCP-547, Why-(interrupted by SCP-547)</p>\n<p>SCP-547: Call me Coldplay right now if you would please. I have been lately enjoying their new album (skips past small talk between O5-\u2588\u2588 and SCP-547)</p>\n<p>O5-\u2588\u2588: Anyway, after your limited viewings on the files we have on those two monsters, why do you want to kill them? From what you've told us, you have never personally fought or even met SCP-517 or SCP-682.</p>\n<p>SCP-547: Because they seem like such great blokes and I'd like to go down to the pub later and have a drink with the old chaps. (SCP-547 chuckles lightly) No\u2026they are, as you said, monsters Overseer. And all they crave are pure destruction and chaos. They, as you have mentioned in your files, must be destroyed at all costs. Plus your little tests tend to bore me, I'd like to go have a real fight once in a while.</p>\n<p>O5-\u2588\u2588: I see\u2026and what of SCP-076? You have a great personal interest in him, often claiming how you understand his actions and why he does what he does.</p>\n<p>SCP-547: He seems like an amazing man, not only to fight against but to also talk to. You humans can't begin to understand what he truly fights for but I know what goes through his mind every time he kills one of your agents\u2026he's like a hero to me, but I promise I won't be causing any major havoc like him any time soon.</p>\n<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Addendum 547-03:</strong> After the incident of [DATA EXPUNGED], SCP-547 has one final element that he has control over. From what was recorded from remaining equipment of the first few hours of incident, SCP-547 can conjure up massive storms and fierce wind. Gale force winds were noted to be at over 400 mph and massive tornadoes ranking far past F6 on the Fujita scale were recorded to be just the beginning. Being that there appears to be no items that SCP-547 wears to help subject control wind, research has concluded that this is SCP-547's raw power. After waiting a week, heavy downpour of rain and lightning and continued twisters were spotted by satellite imaging and personnel far enough way from storms.</p>\n<p>After waiting another week, all storm activity had ceased and remnants of storage facility and all stationed personnel had been deemed missing or deceased. Upon interrogation shortly afterwards, SCP-547 appeared very drained and confused at what had happened, claiming amnesia of the event. For weeks, subjects usual activities were non-existent , often times SCP-547 would be lying about or sleeping heavily.</p>\n<p>Despite obvious fatigue of SCP-547, no injuries were present when unconcious body of subject was recovered. It was later concluded that SCP-547 is completely immune to all of subject' displays of power. It should also be noted that the orb inside SCP-547's chest was almost completely dimmed after being examined by medical personnel upon recovery after Incident [DATA EXPUNGED].</p>\n<p><em>O5-level note: On \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, SCP-547 was terminated by Dr. Clef during a <a href=\"/incident-239-b-clef-kondraki\">containment breach incident</a>. During the termination reports, it was determined that SCP-547's file had been corrupted by <a href=\"/scp-732\">SCP-732</a>, resulting in a grossly distorted version of his abilities. The original text, as written, follows.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Item#:</strong> SCP-547</p>\n<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>\n<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-547 is to be contained within a 15'x10'x10' room at Site-17. Walls are to be constructed of a ceramic carbon-carbon compound rated for at least 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit, with a door lined with the same materials (see NASA for details re: procurement of surplus Space Shuttle heat tiles). SCP-547's containment is only done as precaution in case of accidental loss of control, as subject has shown no real hostility towards the staff, and has been very cooperative in all research endeavours into his abilities.</p>\n<p>Any reasonable request for changes to his living quarters are to be provided within two working periods. SCP-547's most common request is for music: its tastes tend to run towards alternative rock and similar music. It has expressed an extreme dislike towards Hip-Hop music. As music appears to allow it to better control its abilities (perhaps a psychological side-effect), these requests are to be granted at the soonest available opportunity.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-547 is a young, muscular Caucasian male in his late teenage years, in good health. His real name is not known, but he prefers to be referred to by a series of pseudonyms, often derived from comic-book culture. He currently prefers to be called \"Coldplay,\" a combined reference to his favorite band and his thermal control abilities. Prior designations have included, but are not limited to: \"Firestarter,\" \"Pyro,\" \"Elemental,\" and \"Muse.\"</p>\n<p>Subject is 2m (6'3\") and weighs 85kg (190 lbs.). MRI and X-Ray reveal SCP-547's body to be completely human with the exception of a radiation-opaque mass located where its heart would be. Exploratory surgery has discovered a plasma sphere, approximately 10cm (4 in) in diameter, located in the center of SCP-547's chest. SCP-547 also possesses a secondary vascular system, running parallel to the lymph and blood vessels, the apparent purpose of which is to transport plasma from the heart to the extremities. Any attempts to extract this organ have resulted in the destruction of the surgical instruments: as further attempts are likely to kill the subject, this line of research is to be halted for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p>Every cell in SCP-547's body appears to have been laced with a dense carbon-nanotube netting, rendering its entire body a highly efficient \"superconductor\" for thermal energy. SCP-547's ability to rapidly transfer heat from one location to another not only renders it virtually invulnerable to high temperatures, but allows for a modicum of control as well. In one experiment, SCP-547 was able to transfer the \"flame\" from one candle to another by snuffing one candle out with his right hand while touching the wick of the other with his left index fingertip. In another experiment, SCP-547 was able to completely freeze a glass of water within ten seconds simply by dipping his finger into it and transferring away its heat.</p>\n<p>How SCP-547 is able to manipulate heat energy is unknown at this time, but is the subject of further research.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 547-A:</strong> <em>Due to the obvious tactical implications, and SCP-547's eagerness to contribute to the mission of the Foundation, I would like to propose that he be redesignated from Keter to Euclid, and that he be allowed to join the next incoming class of Academy cadets. I can fully vouch for his character, and can, without a doubt, assure the upper-echelon staff that this young man is not only a minimal threat to Foundation security, but has the capability to become a valuable asset who will serve us well.</em></p>\n<p><em>- Dr. A. Clef</em> (REQUEST GRANTED ON \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 BY O5-\u2588)</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 547-B:</strong> <em>SCP-547 has officially requested permission to challenge Able for entry into Mobile Task Force Omega-7. This request is currently under review.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/decomm:scp-547-d\">SCP-547-D</a>\" by Unknown Author, from the <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

All personnel in containment facility are to be evacuated immediately and facility locked down for at least 2 weeks.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-547 appears to be a young, muscular Caucasian male in his late teenage years.\u00a0\u00a0Subject is 2m (6'3\") and weighs 85kg (190 lbs.). Since original encounter with SCP-547 in Austria near the small village of\u00a0\u00a0in 17\u2588\u2588, subject appears to have not aged at all.\u00a0\u00a0MRI and X-Ray reveal SCP-547's body to be completely human with the exception of where subject's heart would be.\u00a0\u00a0After much convincing, SCP-547 was given an autopsy, where surgeons discovered a pure white ball of energy 10x10 cm (4 in) and arteries and veins leading from it in the center of subject's chest.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nOnce again with much persuasion to SCP-547, temporary removal of ball was performed. Attempted removal of this object proved very difficult, as one surgeon tried to touch it, his entire body was completely vaporized. Eventually a robot arm was used to remove glowing orb. As soon as this object left SCP-547's body, all organ and brain functions ceased instantly.\u00a0\u00a0Due to this shocking development, the surgeons quickly put the glowing orb back, and all of SCP-547's bodily functions and brain patterns resumed instantly. Several tests have been done on SCp-547's \"heart\" and all have revealed any and all organic matter that comes into physical contact with subject's orb are instantly vaporized to nothing.\n\n\n\nOnce the autopsy was concluded, SCP-547 left the facility to go outside before his opening could be stitched.\u00a0\u00a0Armed personnel attempted to stop subject but all resistance against SCP-547 was crushed non-lethally and subdued by subject.\u00a0\u00a0After getting outside the facility, subject simply took some dirt from the ground and rubbed the soil into the wound, completely healing the wound in a matter of seconds.\u00a0\u00a0SCP-547 then returned to containment cell and refused all requests of interviews for several days.\n\n\n\nWhilst in an \"idle\" position, subject's features are fairly normal; pale skin, dark green eyes, and sharp features that exhibit a handsome young man.\u00a0\u00a0Subject's hair whilst \"idle\" is black and generally slicked back, keeping most of the hair out of his face.\u00a0\u00a0IQ tests reveal that SCP-547's IQ is around 140, despite his somewhat carefree attitude.\u00a0\u00a0In all aspects, SCP-547 acts as a normal teenage boy, showing keen interest in women, and often displaying an acute sense of sarcasm and a charming nature when engaging with observing personnel.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nOn each of the subjects limbs are pieces of black armor, made out of an unknown metal.\u00a0\u00a0On his right and left hands are two metal black gauntlets that run halfway up both forearms.\u00a0\u00a0Upon his feet are two boots made of the same unknown metal that come to mid-calf.\u00a0\u00a0All attempts to remove these pieces of armor from subject have failed, it appears only SCP-547 can remove these objects from his body at any time.\u00a0\u00a0Recorded tests have shown that each piece of armor that the subject wears has a certain elemental trait to it, his right glove having the power of fire, his left having control of electricity, his left boot being able to conjure and control massive amounts of water, and his right being able to create massive tremors and shatter all known sediments.\u00a0\u00a0It has also been noted that when any of these elemental powers are activated, the corresponding piece of armor becomes encased with the element being used and also appears to augment SCP-547's physical abilities.\n\n\n\n* Right Gauntlet: Becomes encased in fire and appears to give SCP-547 limited flight.\u00a0\u00a0Subject's eyes become glowing red like embers and hair becomes a living flame.\n\n\n\n* Left Gauntlet: Bolts of blue lightning appear to wrap around the glove and augment 547's speed, giving him amazing movement ability that has been recorded up to 200 mph and physical strikes with his body at over 50 times in one second. Hair becomes extremely spiky and yellow and eyes glow blue whilst sparks of electricity shoot out from pupils.\n\n\n\n* Left Boot: Is surrounded by bluish water that appears to be from the sea.\u00a0\u00a0Subject then gains the extraordinary ability to turn whole being into water, making him virtually invincible to all physical attacks.\u00a0\u00a0Hair whilst in a solid state of being is deep blue and appears constantly soaked in a liquid that has yet to be identified.\u00a0\u00a0Pupils appear to be waves of the ocean.\n\n\n\n* Right Boot:\u00a0\u00a0Becomes completely encased in solid granite and gives SCP-547 incredible strength and hardens skin immensely.\u00a0\u00a0Hair and eyes become a deep brown.\n\n\n\n**Additional Notes:**\u00a0\u00a0Until modern day headphones and more suitable means of playing music were developed, containment and even submission of SCP-547 was near impossible, for his destructive capabilities and strange regeneration abilities through use of the environment made subject's capture extremely difficult.\u00a0\u00a0By coincidence, as SCP-547 was about to rip through yet another task force sent out to subdue subject, one agent had left the radio on in one of the transports, playing \"\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\" by the band \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\u00a0\u00a0Upon hearing the music, SCP-547's rampage stopped abruptly as he continued to listen to the song.\u00a0\u00a0After the song finished, subject turned himself in gladly under the condition that he be allowed to listen to the music.\u00a0\u00a0Really hating that he had to stoop this low, Agent Infred talked 547 into handing over his boots and gauntlets. Infred crossed himself, and made a comment about 'the ends justifying the means.'\n\n\n\nAfter originally being contained in Site \u2588\u2588, subject was then moved to Site \u2588\u2588 after Incident [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n\n\nOriginal containment cell was constantly filled with classic rock of the current time such as \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and many others.\u00a0\u00a0As the current music changed and grew into many different genres, 547's tastes expanded as well, enveloping many different styles of music, with the exception of rap and hip hop.\u00a0\u00a0When finally contained and observed, SCP-547 admitted to only being able to speak English after hearing \"\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\" in his capture.\u00a0\u00a0After much brainstorming, several scientists gave SCP-547 Latin music, and after listening to several different songs in Portuguese and Spanish, subject was fluent in both.\u00a0\u00a0From this point on, subject has listened to music in over 20 different languages and fluently spoke and understood all after engaging in region's music.\n\n\n\nSCP-547 claims to have an actual name, \"but cannot remember at the moment\" when asked to identify itself.\u00a0\u00a0Often, SCP-547 will request being addressed by its current favorite band name.\u00a0\u00a0Currently, it is calling itself Muse and asks all personnel to address him by the band name.\u00a0\u00a0It has been observed that SCP-547 also displays very limited telepathy, ironically this only applies to music and the elements of nature.\u00a0\u00a0He claims he knows when he wants a new song, and can identify it lyrically despite never hearing the tune before.\u00a0\u00a0It is recommended but not required that all D-Personnel have some familiarity in today's pop music.\u00a0\u00a0All observing scientists and O5-\u2588\u2588 are to be constantly brought up to date upon SCP-547's current music tastes and most recently recorded abilities in the field.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nSCP-547 other telepathic skill is that to actually communicate with nature.\u00a0\u00a0Subject claims he can feel the earth around him, and with his own powers, can heal whatever damage may be inflicted; either in the air, water, or the ground.\u00a0\u00a0Personnel have said after being in the facility housing SCP-547, the air and water around them feels new and fresh.\u00a0\u00a0Subject claims to be responsible for renewing the environment, though he does this cleaning process subconsciously.\u00a0\u00a0Rejuvenation of damaged environments, either by natural causes or human means require SCP-547's more individual attention and focus.\u00a0\u00a0Several proposals have been made that SCP-547 be used to restore the rain forests of Brazil or clean up oil spills in various parts of the ocean.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 547-01:**\u00a0\u00a0After removal of SCP-547's armor, several tests were conducted on the objects along with SCP-547's abilities without the armor on.\u00a0\u00a0Subject's abilities are much more powerful and uncontrollable.\u00a0\u00a0SCP-547 still can activate these powers at will, but they are no longer restricted to each limb and cannot be formed or aimed, simply being shot out in massive bursts of the respective element.\u00a0\u00a0Study of the gloves and boots concludes that they act as conduits that control the elements created by SCP-547.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt is absolutely imperative that only SCP-547 be allowed to wear these items, as any other human who dons these objects will be brutally killed by various means depending on the item worn.\u00a0\u00a0Class D personnel who have worn the right gauntlet instantly burst in flames, quickly incinerating the body in a matter of seconds.\u00a0\u00a0When wearing the left glove, subject becomes electrocuted, eventually causing the heart to burst.\u00a0\u00a0The left boot causes the wearer's lungs to become completely filled with water, effectively drowning them in a few seconds.\u00a0\u00a0The right boot causes massive hemorrhaging of all organs, personnel quickly dying in a minute or less due to major loss of blood.\u00a0\u00a0These affects only apply to humans as all tests have shown no affect on animals of any species.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 547-02:**\u00a0\u00a0SCP-547 is extremely social and most often will always agree to either a chat about various music or an interview with personnel above Level 3 or any O5 director, however SCP-547 has dodged or simply refused to answer all questions regarding his past and how old he truly is.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nSCP-547 shows particular interest in [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-076 SCP-076] after being allowed limited viewing of other SCP files.\u00a0\u00a0SCP-547 wishes to have a \"sparring match\" against SCP-076-02 to see who could beat the other.\u00a0\u00a0Due to the destructive nature of both and the catastrophe that could result from such powerful SCPs clashing, all ideas of said fight have been put on hold and put under heavy scrutiny, with Command currently debating the true research potential of both fighting and also the heavy risk of major loss of both environmental and human life.\u00a0\u00a0Subject has also recently expressed interest similar to that of [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-213 SCP-213] despite never being presented any file information or verbal instruction.\u00a0\u00a0SCP-547's full psychic abilities are believed to yet be recorded, further study shall be conducted.\n\n\n\nSCP-547 also has expressed a great desire to fight and kill [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-517 SCP-517] and [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-682 SCP-682].\u00a0\u00a0In this interview, O5-\u2588\u2588 spoke to SCP-547 through video feed while two Class D Personnel maintained technical apparatus.\n\n\n\n\n\n> **<Begin Log>**\n\n> \n\n> O5-\u2588\u2588:\u00a0\u00a0SCP-547, Why-(interrupted by SCP-547)\n\n> \n\n> SCP-547: Call me Coldplay right now if you would please.\u00a0\u00a0I have been lately enjoying their new album (skips past small talk between O5-\u2588\u2588 and SCP-547)\n\n> \n\n> O5-\u2588\u2588: Anyway, after your limited viewings on the files we have on those two monsters, why do you want to kill them?\u00a0\u00a0From what you've told us, you have never personally fought or even met SCP-517 or SCP-682.\n\n> \n\n> SCP-547: Because they seem like such great blokes and I'd like to go down to the pub later and have a drink with the old chaps.

During the termination reports, it was determined that SCP-547's file had been corrupted by [[[SCP-732]]], resulting in a grossly distorted version of his abilities. The original text, as written, follows.//\n\n\n\n> **Item#:** SCP-547\n\n> \n\n> **Object Class:** Euclid\n\n> \n\n> **Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-547 is to be contained within a 15'x10'x10' room at Site-17. Walls are to be constructed of a ceramic carbon-carbon compound rated for at least 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit, with a door lined with the same materials (see NASA for details re: procurement of surplus Space Shuttle heat tiles). SCP-547's containment is only done as precaution in case of accidental loss of control, as subject has shown no real hostility towards the staff, and has been very cooperative in all research endeavours into his abilities.\n\n> \n\n> Any reasonable request for changes to his living quarters are to be provided within two working periods. SCP-547's most common request is for music: its tastes tend to run towards alternative rock and similar music. It has expressed an extreme dislike towards Hip-Hop music. As music appears to allow it to better control its abilities (perhaps a psychological side-effect), these requests are to be granted at the soonest available opportunity.\n\n> \n\n> \n\n> **Description:** SCP-547 is a young, muscular Caucasian male in his late teenage years, in good health.\u00a0\u00a0His real name is not known, but he prefers to be referred to by a series of pseudonyms, often derived from comic-book culture. He currently prefers to be called \"Coldplay,\" a combined reference to his favorite band and his thermal control abilities. Prior designations have included, but are not limited to: \"Firestarter,\" \"Pyro,\" \"Elemental,\" and \"Muse.\"\n\n> \n\n> Subject is 2m (6'3\") and weighs 85kg (190 lbs.). MRI and X-Ray reveal SCP-547's body to be completely human with the exception of a radiation-opaque mass located where its heart would be. Exploratory surgery has discovered a plasma sphere, approximately 10cm (4 in) in diameter, located in the center of SCP-547's chest. SCP-547 also possesses a secondary vascular system, running parallel to the lymph and blood vessels, the apparent purpose of which is to transport plasma from the heart to the extremities. Any attempts to extract this organ have resulted in the destruction of the surgical instruments: as further attempts are likely to kill the subject, this line of research is to be halted for the foreseeable future.\n\n> \n\n> Every cell in SCP-547's body appears to have been laced with a dense carbon-nanotube netting, rendering its entire body a highly efficient \"superconductor\" for thermal energy. SCP-547's ability to rapidly transfer heat from one location to another not only renders it virtually invulnerable to high temperatures, but allows for a modicum of control as well. In one experiment, SCP-547 was able to transfer the \"flame\" from one candle to another by snuffing one candle out with his right hand while touching the wick of the other with his left index fingertip. In another experiment, SCP-547 was able to completely freeze a glass of water within ten seconds simply by dipping his finger into it and transferring away its heat. \n\n> \n\n> How SCP-547 is able to manipulate heat energy is unknown at this time, but is the subject of further research.\n\n> \n\n> **Addendum 547-A:** //Due to the obvious tactical implications, and SCP-547's eagerness to contribute to the mission of the Foundation, I would like to propose that he be redesignated from Keter to Euclid, and that he be allowed to join the next incoming class of Academy cadets. I can fully vouch for his character, and can, without a doubt, assure the upper-echelon staff that this young man is not only a minimal threat to Foundation security, but has the capability to become a valuable asset who will serve us well.//\n\n> \n\n> //- Dr. A. Clef// (REQUEST GRANTED ON \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 BY O5-\u2588)\n\n> \n\n> **Addendum 547-B:** //SCP-547 has officially requested permission to challenge Able for entry into Mobile Task Force Omega-7. This request is currently under review.//\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>\n\n|author=Unknown Author]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["scp-076", "scp-213", "scp-517", "scp-682", "incident-239-b-clef-kondraki", "scp-732", "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "licensing-guide", "licensing-master-list"], "scp": "SCP-547-D", "scp_number": 547, "series": "decommissioned", "tags": ["_licensebox", "decommissioned", "euclid", "humanoid", "neutralized", "scp"], "title": "SCP-547-D", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/decomm:scp-547-d"}, "SCP-723-D": {"created_at": "2011-11-02T20:58:00", "creator": "Quikngruvn", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Quikngruvn", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/quikngruvn", "comment": "Purging the rating with a new page.", "date": "2011-11-02T20:58:00"}, {"author": "Quikngruvn", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/quikngruvn", "comment": "Fixed a link.", "date": "2011-11-02T21:01:00"}, {"author": "Quikngruvn", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/quikngruvn", "comment": "Added tags: decommissioned, humanoid, keter, safe, scp.

For convenience's sake, the physical object suspected of manifesting SCP-857-D is to be stored on a shelf in a locked glass-fronted cabinet in Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's office in Site-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. A web-cam is to be trained on SCP-857-D at all times, monitored by security personnel (or anybody else who feels like it). Even this minimal level of security is likely useless in terms of containing it. Regardless, it needs to be observed with something approaching reverence at all times in a probably futile attempt to prevent it leaving the facility. When Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's office is not in use, personnel may make use of it to directly observe SCP-857-D as opposed to relying upon the webcam. Individuals who fall into obsession concerning SCP-857-D need to be reminded of the spiritual nature of approaching it - a Quest, so to speak. If unsure, check with an alchemist.</p>\n<p>Anyone wishing to make use of the object suspected of being SCP-857-D for either research, religious or personal reasons will apply through [redacted]. Religious groups should be scheduled on different days in order to avoid conflict. If a group is large, the cabinet may be rolled to a room of sufficient seating capacity, then returned to Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's office upon completion of activities. Note that SCP-857-D must be observed at all times (see above) to prevent its migration to another physical object. If an observer begins to behave oddly, becomes ill, explodes or otherwise manifests unsavory effects to exposure to SCP-857-D, he or his remains should be removed to the nearest medical facility for physical (and if appropriate) psychiatric evaluation. Termination is unnecessary as if this was warranted, it would already have occurred. For this reason, keep SCP-857-D well away from SCP-293.</p>\n<p>If anyone, SCP personnel or otherwise, reaches the conclusion that a different physical object now manifests SCP-857-D, this is to be confirmed using Procedure 857-032 and the new SCP-857-D should replace it. The old SCP-857-D may be discarded, kept for research or memorabilia, or donated to a requesting religious (or not) group. A log (Addendum 857-01) will be maintained of its various manifestations.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-857-D's descriptions come down to us over the millenia from a variety of sources, primarily literary with a religious bent. No two descriptions match. This had baffled scholars for generations until it was discovered that SCP-857-D is not an object per se but a Jungian archetype made real. SCP-857-D-ness is mutable and transfers between physical objects, hence the drastic divergence of opinion as to its appearance, behavior and location. There are several physical objects with current claims to be SCP-857-D, having previously shown behavior resembling it. Some of them may very well have manifested SCP-857-D at some time or another. There is no evidence one way or another that they could not be SCP-857-D in the future. (Note - English lacks many parts of speech useful for this style of discussion and few SCP employees know sufficient Greek or Aramaic for discussion in those languages to be helpful)</p>\n<p>The manifestation of SCP-857-D is not limited to any one specific object, merely a single object at a time (as far as can be ascertained). This tends to be an object used for imbibing liquid or dispensing food, current to the time, place and circumstances. This can be as ornate as a bejewelled goblet and as simple as a stone cup. This is not a hard-and-fast rule as it could manifest as a dish, plate, cauldron or stone or even further afield such as a pillar of fire, burning bush or bright, laser-like white light. Researcher [REDACTED] claims to have observed it in this specific manifestation in Grade 9 science class. Her sanity is under debate.</p>\n<p>It is fairly widely held that the first manifestation of SCP-857-D was the shared cup used by the historical religious figure Jesus Christ and his disciples at the Last Supper. This was possibly hosted by Joseph of Arimathea, thus making him the original owner of the original object manifested as SCP-857-D. It is also somewhat held that this cup was also present at the crucifixion of said Jesus Christ and was used to collect blood and water emanating from a wound caused by the Spear of Longinus (not currently in SCP's possession but displayed in Hofburg Museum in Vienna, Austria). It is held by some that this or a ritual at the Last Supper may have been the event creating SCP-857-D. Given that it appears to be a Jungian archetype, it is more likely that SCP-857-D has always been in existence and this is merely the first (but see below) documented manifestation. (Again, this would make more sense in Greek.)</p>\n<p>This view is disputed by those positing earlier manifestations of SCP-857-D, referencing information from Celtic, Roman, Greek and other sources. Most of these address the positive aspects of SCP-857-D. It has been compared to or even identified as the \"Horn of Plenty\", the \"Cauldron of Plenty of Dagda and the Tribe of Anu\", and the \"Holy Grail\" a source of healing and rebirth (both physical and spiritual). Note that the Philosopher's Stone, (see SCP-349) while having similar characteristics, is a different, immutable object. Drinking from the cup, if that is how it is manifested, may cure disease and/or grant immortality (note the dark side below - it is suspected that the Fisher King may have been granted the latter without the former), or merely dispense or render safe or palatable sufficient foodstuff and/or drink to those nearby requiring it. It may be necessary to prime the pump to enable the desired effect. WARNING - under no circumstances use blood or blood by-products</p>\n<p>Few descriptions of SCP-857-D address its dark side (it would hardly be a Jungian archetype without its shadow). An attempt to use SCP-857-D for worldly, nefarious or even trivial purposes can be deadly, hence its Euclid classification. At best its effects in this vein can be described as \"be careful what you wish for\", \"may you live an 'interesting' life\" (that being a curse) and at worst wholesale destruction of cities civilizations , entire planets or stars . The depiction in the movie [REDACTED] while wildly inaccurate, may serve as a cogent warning.</p>\n<p>SCP-857-D tends to manifest itself where it is needed, bound by few or no constraints (other than unity). The fact that it appears to remain at the Site-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 facility begs questions too philosophical to address here, whether it be blessing or blessing in disguise.</p>\n<p>SCP-857-D was discovered on an abandoned cafeteria table in [REDACTED], its previous user having fled, shouting \"I'm cured, I'm cured\". After a brief struggle, SCP-857-D was recovered by Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and transported to a secure laboratory for testing. Its original Keter classification was reduced to Euclid more for budgetary reasons than anything else. Rumours that this was done for fear of \"pissing it off\" are false.</p>\n<p><strong>Procedure 857-032:</strong> Procedure for identifying current SCP-857-D</p>\n<p>Arrange for observation of SCP-857 by several trained personnel (or anyone else suitable available) either remotely (eg. by webcam) or behind blast-proof shielding. Expose one mildly offensive D-class subject to SCP-857-D and observe resulting ill effects (if any). Clean up resulting mess if necessary. Failure here may indicate either an innocuous object, a different SCP-class object, sufficient spirituality in the D-class subject to avoid adverse effects or subject is a thief and apparently immune. Repeat with more offensive subject. Due to sensitivities of both sexes and [REDACTED], avoid using rapists or child molesters for subjects at all costs.</p>\n<p>Expose one spiritual subject to SCP-857-D and observe results. A positive outcome is about the best we have for proof of manifestation of SCP-857-D in the test object. A negative outcome may indicate a different SCP object in play or that the second subject isn't as spiritual as originally thought. Repeat if necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 857-001:</strong> Manifestations since acquisition by SCP</p>\n<p>SCP-857-D was originally identified following reports of a magical water cooler just inside the entrance to Building-C at Site-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. As word spread, the area became disruptive to the point where it had to be cordoned off at which point rioting broke out. The next person drinking from the water cooler discovered the \"magic was gone\". A few days later a coffee pot on the third floor began dispensing an elixir that granted perfect attention span and other benefits. The scenario was repeated. The effect spread to other commonplace items including a variety of glasses, coffee cups, and one memorable evening, the New Year's Eve punch bowl. When that was broken in a scuffle, the current SCP-857-D was identified, rescued and spirited under guard to a laboratory for testing, then to Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's office where it remains.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 857-001-D:</strong></p>\n<p>SCP-857-D has been <a href=\"/scp-857-d\">decommissioned</a>.</p>\n</div></body></html>", "raw_source": "\n\t**Item #:** SCP-857-D\n\n\n\n**Object Class:** Euclid\n\n\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Impossible.\u00a0\u00a0For convenience's sake, the physical object suspected of manifesting SCP-857-D is to be stored on a shelf in a locked glass-fronted cabinet in Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's office in Site-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\u00a0\u00a0A web-cam is to be trained on SCP-857-D at all times, monitored by security personnel (or anybody else who feels like it).\u00a0\u00a0Even this minimal level of security is likely useless in terms of containing it.\u00a0\u00a0Regardless, it needs to be observed with something approaching reverence at all times in a probably futile attempt to prevent it leaving the facility.\u00a0\u00a0When Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's office is not in use, personnel may make use of it to directly observe SCP-857-D as opposed to relying upon the webcam.\u00a0\u00a0Individuals who fall into obsession concerning SCP-857-D need to be reminded of the spiritual nature of approaching it - a Quest, so to speak.\u00a0\u00a0If unsure, check with an alchemist.\n\n\n\nAnyone wishing to make use of the object suspected of being SCP-857-D for either research, religious or personal reasons will apply through [redacted].\u00a0\u00a0Religious groups should be scheduled on different days in order to avoid conflict.\u00a0\u00a0If a group is large, the cabinet may be rolled to a room of sufficient seating capacity, then returned to Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's office upon completion of activities.
