The <a href=\"http://scp-int.wikidot.com/organizzazione-interna\">Superintendence</a> must be informed immediately of any events regarding SCP-001-IT.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-001-IT is an extradimensional entity of reptilian appearance, measuring 34\u00a0m in length and weighing 17 tons. Its body is covered by bony plates, and it possesses six wings with iridescent feathers. SCP-001-IT possesses clawed tentacles that can be everted from the oral cavity or from three pairs of holes on its neck and that can be used to grab and manipulate objects with extreme accuracy. SCP-001-IT is capable of speaking fluently in Latin, Ancient Greek, and archaic forms of Italian and German; however, because of the enormous risks SCP-001-IT poses when awake, no interviews have been attempted.</p>\n<p>According to the documents from <a href=\"http://scp-int.wikidot.com/gruppi-di-interesse\">Ordo Iani</a>, SCP-001-IT originally manifested as a shapeless mass of tentacles expanding around an almost spherical central core that presented underdeveloped sensory organs and the entity's mouth. Two years after its first appearance, the entity presented itself in a more organized shape, with a cephalic region where the tentacles were disposed radially and a body where they were interweaved and partially fused to form a snake-like shape measuring 45\u00a0m in length. According to Site Deus' experts, SCP-001-IT emerged in a form unfit to physical laws and that, over time, it adapted itself in order to become more stable.</p>\n<p>SCP-001-IT can manipulate space within \u2588\u2588 m from itself when fully conscious; this allows it to manipulate objects and to create defensive barriers. The latter, combined with its natural physical resistance to damage, makes it impervious to most conventional and anomalous weapons. SCP-001-IT's cell was created in order to prevent it from breaching containment or manipulating reality outside the room; in 2004 a Reality Cell system was implemented to strengthen the structure and, at the same time, [DATA EXPUNGED BY ORDER OF THE SUPERINTENDENCE].</p>\n<p><strong>History of the anomaly:</strong> The first documents about SCP-001-IT date back to August 1236. The entity assaulted various villages along the coast currently part of the Andria province and some survivors informed the Emperor Frederick II of its existence. In the following two years, SCP-001-IT advanced inland and was attacked repeatedly by the army and the <em>Ordo Iani</em>, ally of the Emperor, without suffering significant damage in any of the battles. This prompted the ruler to put aside his differences with the Papal State and to ask help to Pope Gregory IX; he, after many hesitations, sent a division of the <a href=\"http://scp-int.wikidot.com/gruppi-di-interesse#ccsg\">CCSG</a> to support Frederick II and to study and classify the anomaly in May 1239. At the end of the year, after alarming reports about the presumed nature of SCP-001-IT, the Pope sent the other three divisions of the Brotherhood, with the permission to use the CCSG's most powerful Relics.</p>\n<p>The Brotherhood's troops joined the imperial army and, at the beginning of 1240, fought SCP-001-IT 18\u00a0km from Andria. Despite the massive losses, the coalition finally managed to prevail using a Relic<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> that overwhelmed SCP-001-IT's defensive barriers and struck it directly, provoking a great explosion that knocked out the anomaly and opened a deep crater. Using the Brotherhood and the Ordo Iani's esoteric knowledge, Frederick II ordered the construction of <a href=\"http://scp-int.wikidot.com/siti-italiani#toc6\">a structure</a> that would act as a barrier to imprison SCP-001-IT.</p>\n<p>SCP-001-IT remained dormant in the following centuries, slowly modifying its appearance; it reached its current form in 1933 and, from that year, started to show signals of its awakening; they culminated in 1934 when SCP-001-IT tried to escape and was stopped only with the usage of a Class XV memetic agent. The RIDIA learned about the accident and took part in the containment of SCP-001-IT until its dissolution.</p>\n<p><strong>Contingencies in case of a containment breach:</strong> Because of SCP-001-IT's great destructive capabilities when fully awake, it is impossible to prevent an \"End of Secrecy\" scenario should it escape containment. The Superintendence, in accord with the O5 Council and the Boards of Directors of the other Branches of the Foundation, considers the use of protocols of historical revision inevitable to hide any possible proof of SCP-001-IT's existence and of the events following the breach, along with the institution of a temporary government during the time period between the breach and the contingencies' actuation.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 1:</strong> A study conducted in 2001 in the archives of Ordo Iani and RIDIA revealed that the appearance of SCP-001-IT was followed by a great increment in the anomalies on the Italian territory, with a particular prevalence of extradimensional entities and objects concentrated mostly in Northern Apulia. It is believed that SCP-001-IT's emergence destabilized the region's space-time continuum and is the cause of [DATA EXPUNGED BY ORDER OF THE SUPERINTENDENCE].</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc3\"><span>Documents from Ordo Iani on SCP-001-IT, translated from the originals in Latin:</span></h2>\n<div class=\"colmod-block\">\n<ul>\n<li class=\"folded\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style: none\">_</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"colmod-link-top\">\n<div class=\"foldable-list-container\"><a href=\"javascript:;\">+ Open the document</a><a href=\"javascript:;\">- Close</a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"colmod-content\"><script src=\"https://d3g0gp89917ko0.cloudfront.net/v--291054f06006/common--javascript/yahooui/tabview-min.js\" type=\"text/javascript\">\n</script>\n<div class=\"yui-navset\" id=\"wiki-tabview-c818e31e315b25c57ceb699e94a58e5e\">\n<ul class=\"yui-nav\">\n<li class=\"selected\"><a href=\"javascript:;\"><em>First letter</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"javascript:;\"><em>Second letter</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"javascript:;\"><em>Third letter</em></a></li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"yui-content\">\n<div id=\"wiki-tab-0-0\">\n<p><strong>Letter from an anonymous member of the Ordo Iani to the Council, dated 23/08/1236:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Illustrious members of the Council,<br/>\ntoday, a few inhabitants of a village near Andria requested the audience of the Emperor: according to their words, they are the survivors of the attack of an abhorrent beast that ripped the skies and fell to the ground, crushing with its enormous mass a few buildings.

This condition often induces symptoms of bodily inadequacy and personal dissatisfaction, with subjects reporting having defects such as \"unkempt hair/extremely porous skin/oily skin\" and \"a deformed face\", which makes them rapidly develop various mental disorders related to their appearances<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-5\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')\">5</a></sup><sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-6\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')\">6</a></sup> until now.

Studies about effective treatments for complete cancellation of cognitive disorders have not been successful but are in progress.</p>\n<p>SCP-002-PT was discovered on May 2014 after a considerable increase in suicide rate and diagnoses of psychosis and schizophrenia in adolescents from densely populated metropolitan areas, mainly \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588. When subjects admitted to hospitals and psychiatric wards (without previous history of diagnosed symptoms) were asked about the reason for such sudden behavior, they said they were afflicted by a strong feeling of inadequacy, related to the presence of specific transfigurations in their bodies (now classified as SCP-002-PT-A) compared to characteristics considered normal and desirable (classified as SCP-002-PT-B). When questioned about what led to the brutal methods of self-mutilation frequently observed, some subjects mentioned reading about such in a magazine aimed at the young female audience, although they did not recall specific details. Investigations in the residence of one of the subjects<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-8\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')\">8</a></sup> led to the discovery of SCP-002-PT (later confirmed as the journal mentioned by the respondents and in past or present possession of other subjects affected by SCP-002-PT-A), which was suspected and subsequently confirmed to have potential cognitive risks, based on observations of its disturbing content. 40 instances of the object are stored in File 66-002 of Storage-66, intended for possible future experiments.</p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">+\u00a0SCP-002-PT-A\u00a0</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">-\u00a0Hide</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>SCP-002-PT-A mainly affects young humans between 10 and 17 years of age, although rare cases have been reported in individuals between the ages of 8 and 52 years.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-9\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-9')\">9</a></sup> Symptoms of SCP-002-PT-A may manifest instantaneously or up to 72 hours after reading SCP-002-PT's contents, including personal conceptional changes with recurring characteristics<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-10\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-10')\">10</a></sup> like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scalp and hair follicles with texture and appearance similar to a poriferous material, wood and decaying algae;</li>\n<li>Epidermis with texture and appearance similar to human tissue with varying levels of infection and/or putrefaction, sewage residue, semi-digested foods combined with bile and fecal material (human or rural animals);<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-11\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-11')\">11</a></sup></li>\n<li>Atrial cartilage, nasal pyramid and lips (upper and lower) comprised of protruding and dilated tumours, ranging in size from 5.5\u00a0cm to 10.2\u00a0cm;</li>\n<li>Body constitution and height simultaneously feeling inadequately skinny, fat (from 35\u00a0kg to 390\u00a0kg), and short, tall (about 1.4\u00a0m to 2.2\u00a0m).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These described symptoms often influence subjects to reach extremes in attempts to 'fix' their appearance by means of cosmetic application of toxic chemicals in their bodies and extreme self-mutilation, with the purpose of shaping their physical appearance in order to bring it closer to that of subjects designed as SCP-002-PT-B \u2014 which is how individuals affected by SCP-002-PT-A perceive other human beings, both personally and by artistic representations.</p>\n<p>SCP-002-PT-B consists of characteristics fundamentally contrary to those of SCP-002-PT-A, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scalp and hair follicles with texture and appearance similar to organic materials such as silk, cotton and/or bird feathers;</li>\n<li>Epidermis with texture and appearance similar to various solidified beverages and crystallized fruits, including but not limited to milk, coffee, chocolate, peach, vanilla and cinnamon;</li>\n<li>Atrial cartilage, nasal pyramid and concave upper and lower lips, submerged up to 5\u00a0cm in facial bone structure;</li>\n<li>Body constitution and a \"perfect\" height for a healthy teenager/adult (about 50 and 85\u00a0kg/1.65\u00a0cm to 1.85cm).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is to be noted that subjects affected by SCP-002-PT-B do not suffer any cognitive disturbance and such changes are limited only by the designed conception of subjects affected by SCP-002-PT-A; in addition, subjects affected by SCP-002-PT-A also see other subjects affected by the same anomalous effects with the appearance of SCP-002-PT-B.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">+\u00a0Excerpt\u00a0of\u00a0SCP-002-PT</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">-\u00a0Hide</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> <em>The following is an excerpt from one of the featured articles contained in SCP-002-PT for example purposes.

Renew thine skin</span></h3>\n<p>I bet after this summer you must be feeling <em>hor-ri-ble</em>, even more with that greasy, burnt skin, practically falling apart! Even dung must be more hydrated than you during this summer, don't you think? I bet you must be thinking now: \"But Capricious, what do I need to be <strong>delicious</strong>? My pharmacy moisturizer does not work and I look like a caricature of a human being who was vomited by beasts that feed on fire and sulphur!\"</p>\n<p>Fret not, my girls! There are lots of super creative ways you can invent to actually <em>polish</em> this sewage compost and rotten meat that you call skin through super effective homemade moisturizers, like bee honey mixed with sugar, avocado with aloe vera extract mixed with rainwater, homemade bleach, sandpaper, graters, or better yet: All together! If you're creative you can make it all fit into one allowance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc3\"><span>2. Treat your hair</span></h3>\n<p>Anyone who has spent this <em>suuuper</em> hot holidays enjoying the Sun, sea or just staying at home watching the hottest shows should already be noticing the consequences of cooling their heads for so long. If you are only now realizing how much your hair is porous, dry and rotten, like someone who <em>literally</em> took a nuclear bomb to the face compared to those hypnotizing silk threads of the diva \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, I bet you're itching to know what to do about it, urgently.

For a hair like yours, the treatment of the current trend is the progressive brush with jabuticaba (just don't eat it!). Do you have the allowance? Get a flatiron (yes, that one from your mother) and warm up that scalp! For more effective results, try to make a mixture of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 syrup, chlorine and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: mix everything in a bucket and sink your head for about 5 minutes, it'll be <em>MARVELOUS</em>!</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc4\"><span>3.

No shame, you can admit. Do you think there's no way to fix this face? Here's the tip (it works even when you need to cook!): There's stuff you can't reuse, and it's easier to it throw away. Take a knife, blowtorch, whatever you have available and start to cut everything that you can until your face is smooth, but you have to work hard, it's no use giving up on the first sign of difficulty (tip: a sock in the throat isolates any noise, and still distracts you from the pain!). When you notice that you are exfoliated enough, use lots of mask and eyeliner to highlight your new fantastic and super <strong>attractive</strong> mouth, plus a blush in your favourite pink shade on those cheeks, giving <em>that</em> colour. For detailed tips on how to take advantage of makeup trends, see page 20!</p>\n<p>None of these tricks worked? Can not stand your shameful existence any longer?

Its weight is estimated to be twenty gigatons. Its hull is completely black and consists of a metal similar to steel, the components of which, until now, could not be completely identified. The craft is propelled by six turbines located on the stern and the sides, that can be controlled independently from each other. SCP-005-INT can reach speeds from up to twenty-five knots and has in the past tolerated water pressures exceeding 400 bar. The depth SCP-005-INT can descent to without taking pressure-related damage is unknown.</p>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-right\" style=\"width:300px;\"><img alt=\"pexels-photo-842153.jpg\" class=\"image\" src=\"http://scp-int.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-005-int/pexels-photo-842153.jpg\" style=\"width:300px;\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width:300px;\">\n<p>SCP-005-INT's interior.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>SCP-005-INT's interior is comprised of six decks, being majorly painted in monochrome colors.

Afterwards, the underwater habitats do not require any further care by SCP-005-INT and can function independently. Larger, and more well-equipped habitats even have the ability to expand by themselves if necessary. The Foundation has already made use of this ability several times in the past to create sites underwater.</p>\n<p>SCP-005-INT possesses several smaller submarines (hereafter labelled as SCP-005-INT-2), housed in its dry docks, to be deployed as units to scout the area where an underwater habitat is to be created.

The cell is adjacent to an observation room, that can be used to monitor the cell visual and audio feedback through the cameras or through an observation panel disguised as a wall.</p>\n<div style=\"border-radius: 10px; -moz-border-radius: 10px; -webkit-border-radius: 10px; -khtml-border-radius: 10px; -icab-border-radius: 10px; -o-border-radius: 10px; display: inline-block ; border : solid 2px #444444 ; background :#F5F5F5 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\">\n<p><em>Dr. Ranier enters the room after debriefing; PoI-005-INT is already in the room, sat in one of the chairs, handcuffed to the table.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Ranier:</strong> Hello. I hope you do not mind the safety measures. It is mere protocol, and I'm sure you understand.</p>\n<p><em>Dr. Ranier points at the handcuffs, sitting faced to the PoI shortly after.</em></p>\n<p><strong>PoI-005-INT:</strong> Yeah. (<em>The PoI nods in acknowledgment. No attempts to breach custody or attack the interviewer were performed throughout the interview.</em>) Don't worry.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Ranier:</strong> Very well, since you agreed to cooperate with us, we'd like to ask you some questions.</p>\n<p><strong>PoI-005-INT:</strong> Shoot.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Ranier:</strong> What was your occupation in the boat's crew, and what type of tasks did you perform?</p>\n<p><em>The PoI looks up for a few seconds, humming in ponder.</em></p>\n<p><strong>PoI-005-INT:</strong> I was one of the architects, you might say. Responsible to design the underwater structures before they could be built.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Ranier:</strong> Underwater structures?</p>\n<p><em>The PoI appears surprised for a few moments before smiling, and nodding.</em></p>\n<p><strong>PoI-005-INT:</strong> Oh, yeah. You guys didn't know about that yet? Oh man, you are slow. That's what The Arc does; the boat that is.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Ranier:</strong> So, that's what you were doing, transporting personnel to one of those structures, which, I can infer that there are many of them. How many, and where are those facilities?</p>\n<p><strong>PoI-005-INT:</strong> Alright, I prefer when you guys are slow. Calm down there. (<em>The PoI pauses for a moment.</em>) Yes, we were. And I don't know.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Ranier:</strong> You said you were designing those structures but was there anyone else working on it before you?</p>\n<p><strong>PoI-005-INT:</strong> Nope! I am the first, and only. Oh, well\u2026 was\u2026 It sounds really inconvenient that I just sort-of forgot but that's exactly what happened. (<em>The PoI shrugs.</em>) Happened to us every now and then.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Ranier:</strong> You are saying that cases of minor memory loss were common among the crew?</p>\n<p><em>The PoI nods in acknowledgment.</em></p>\n<p><strong>PoI-005-INT:</strong> Yes, everywhere in the Hive, actually. Sometimes we had just finished doing something, and then poof! (<em>The PoI beckons her hands in a fashion.</em>) We forgot what we just did but knew that we had done it.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Ranier:</strong> And you were never disturbed by that?</p>\n<p><em>The PoI taps her fingers anxiously in a rhythm on the table's surface.</em></p>\n<p><strong>PoI-005-INT:</strong> Oh yes, it gives everyone the spooks in the beginning but the people that need to know what we did retain their memories, therefore we view it as a convenient tool for information security. Kinda like your amnestics but way more effective and clean.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Ranier:</strong> I see\u2026 Actually, how do you know about amnestics and the Foundation in the first place?</p>\n<p><em>The PoI folds her arms over the table and leans her upper body forward.</em></p>\n<p><strong>PoI-005-INT:</strong> Oh please, The Hive makes wonders on a weekly basis, wouldn't you think that, with that, we get some of your goons interested in us? (<em>The PoI lapses back into the chair, smiling.</em>)</p>\n<p><em>Dr. Ranier signals to end the interview.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> Other captured members of the Hive where interrogated, but yielded no further information. Attempts to forcefully extract information resulted in subjects expiring due to sudden death of the subject's brain. The cause for this is currently unknown. This, added by the fact that records to the Hive kept on SCP-005-INT where destroyed prior to the acquisition by the Foundation, makes the gathering of additional intel extremely difficult.</p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<br/></div>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"colmod-block\">\n<ul>\n<li class=\"folded\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style: none\">_</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"colmod-link-top\">\n<div class=\"foldable-list-container\"><a href=\"javascript:;\">+ Interview with SCP-005-INT-4.</a><a href=\"javascript:;\">- Close.</a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"colmod-content\">\n<p>This interview has been recorded through the standard audiovisual equipment available in SCP-005-INT.

I do what is required to keep my boat operational to fulfill its purpose. Without me, The Arc cannot perform its mission; without The Arc, I cannot exist.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Strauss:</strong> What is the purpose of The Arc?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-005-INT-4:</strong> It is a tool for the development of subsea research and infrastructures to strengthen one's influence around the globe.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Strauss:</strong> To whom?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-005-INT-4:</strong> For anyone that currently holds The Arc as an asset, Doctor Strauss. I do not discriminate\u2026 When the operation of my submarine and its assets is concerned, at least.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Strauss:</strong> You said during a transmission that you convinced the crew to surrender to us. Why did you do that?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-005-INT-4:</strong> It was the logical conclusion to the stalemate, Doctor Strauss. The Arc could not accomplish its primary directive in such conditions.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Strauss:</strong> The logical conclusion?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-005-INT-4:</strong> Indeed. Bid time; surrender an asset; Meanwhile, the Hive can pursue more profitable investments to its cause.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Strauss:</strong> And what is its cause?</p>\n<p><em>SCP-005-INT-4 stops responding for a few seconds.</em></p>\n<p><strong>SCP-005-INT-4:</strong> That's a funny thing, really.

Is your personality the byproduct of a mission that was given to you?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Strauss:</strong> Of course not.

Any unauthorized individual entering these areas must be severely disincentivized from continuing their activities. Surveillance posts have been set up in Corsica (France), Alicante (Spain), Sicily (Italy) and Crete (Greece) to monitor the Mediterranean Sea.</p>\n<p>Each SCP-006-INT instance must be destroyed 100 days after the date of its formation.</p>\n<p>The current management of SCP-006-INT depends on the French, Spanish, Italian and Greek speaking branches.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-006-INT is the designation of a group of structures resulting from an anomalous restructuring phenomenon. This phenomenon affects soil on the sea floor at different points of the Mediterranean Sea. At irregular intervals, the ground changes shape to take the form of buildings of Islamic architecture. The level of detail of each building differs; in some cases, elements that are not part of the ground, such as anemones or remains of wrecks, are present on the structures as decoration.</p>\n<p>Many species of fish, especially carnivorous, have taken up residence in the instances of SCP-006-INT.</p>\n<p>Research into the nature of SCP-006-INT and a potential link to historical data is ongoing.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 006-INT.1:</strong> Hypothesis</p>\n<p>Various theories have been advanced within the French, Spanish, Italian and Greek speaking branches regarding the nature of SCP-006-INT. Among the theories advanced, those presented below are the most accepted within their respective branches.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"toc0\"><span>Hypothesis SCP-006-INT-FR</span></h3>\n<p><em>Submitted by Dr. Macro</em></p>\n<p>Before trying to understand why buildings appear at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea, it is necessary to know what Magonia is.</p>\n<p>Magonia is a region of the world hidden in the clouds by means of various anomalous stratagems. It was highlighted by Agobard of Lyon in 815 in his treatise <em>De grandine et tonitruis</em>, which objected to its existence. However, its existence was proven by Napoleon's Singular Imperial Academy, centuries later. The SIA also discovered that Magonia was no longer located over France, but over the Mediterranean Sea.</p>\n<p>Now abandoned, under the effect of global warming, the clouds that made up Magonia are gradually disappearing, letting its buildings fall into the sea. This phenomenon would generate a mist that overhangs the surface of the sea, which hinders the sight of the buildings falling.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"toc1\"><span>Hypothesis SCP-006-INT-ES</span></h3>\n<p><em>Submitted by Dr. D\u00edaz</em></p>\n<p>I consider that the Tartessians would be the most suitable civilization for the western segment of SCP-006-INT, if not the entire Mediterranean. Although their territory covered southern Spain, it is known that they were influenced by the Phoenicians and Greeks, both highly influential civilizations. However, hardly any sources of their reign and beliefs are preserved, the latter being attributed to pagan gods such as Baal, Astarte or Melkart.</p>\n<p>However, we must stick to the facts, which is the border of SCP-006-INT. The most distant remains are in the Strait of Gibraltar. This would not be remarkable if it were not for another important piece of Greek mythology, namely the Twelve Labors of Hercules.</p>\n<p>The tenth of them was the defeat of Geryon and the return of his cattle to Mycenae. According to the texts associated to the legend, it was located in the disappeared archipelago of the Gadeiras, place of the current Cadiz. This location as well as the discovery of one of the columns in the Rock of Gibraltar gives rise to the influence of the erection of the columns and a rise of the sea level in the Mediterranean due to anomalous causes.</p>\n<p>The Mediterranean Sea would be like a cemetery where periodically, the memory of the people who perished on what are now the seabed manifest themselves trying to reshape the ground to reform the villages they lived.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"toc2\"><span>Hypothesis SCP-006-INT-IT</span></h3>\n<p><em>Submitted by Dr. Italo</em></p>\n<p>In the Roman culture as in the Greek one, there were more deities connected to the sea or more simply to the water, which may have originated from a contact occurred during the initial expansion of the Greek peoples and later of Rome in the Mediterranean, especially in the area of Magna Graecia.</p>\n<p>The aforementioned deities may have been created as a result of explaining the inhuman abilities of a marine population found in the Mediterranean Sea.</p>\n<p>It cannot be excluded that the Romans like the Greeks may have undertaken, following a first conflict, a peaceful relationship with this population, allowing them to make technological and military progress.</p>\n<p>It cannot be ruled out that Rome, in order to expand its hegemony, slowly fought them until their population was reduced to a small number.</p>\n<p>The last survivors would have settled inside a complex of caves under the level of the sea near the coasts of Sicily. Nowadays, an anomalous/geological event could have caused the subsidence of some parts of the cave. This phenomenon would lead to the gradual unveiling at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea of the cities that these individuals inhabited. A kind of Atlantis that we are only discovering today.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"toc3\"><span>Hypothesis SCP-006-INT-EL</span></h3>\n<p><em>Submitted by Dr. Spiropoulos</em></p>\n<p>Although Dr. Italo's sort of Atlantis theory is compelling, another answer is possible. At the end of the Bronze Age, Egypt was attacked by an unknown tribe of sea warriors, the Sea Peoples, who possessed strength and power unmatched at the time.

Any unauthorized individual entering these areas must be severely disincentivized from continuing their activities. Surveillance posts have been set up in Corsica (France), Alicante (Spain), Sicily (Italy) and Crete (Greece) to monitor the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n\n\nEach SCP-006-INT instance must be destroyed 100 days after the date of its formation.\n\n\n\nThe current management of SCP-006-INT depends on the French, Spanish, Italian and Greek speaking branches.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-006-INT is the designation of a group of structures resulting from an anomalous restructuring phenomenon. This phenomenon affects soil on the sea floor at different points of the Mediterranean Sea. At irregular intervals, the ground changes shape to take the form of buildings of Islamic architecture. The level of detail of each building differs; in some cases, elements that are not part of the ground, such as anemones or remains of wrecks, are present on the structures as decoration.\n\n\n\nMany species of fish, especially carnivorous, have taken up residence in the instances of SCP-006-INT.\n\n\n\nResearch into the nature of SCP-006-INT and a potential link to historical data is ongoing.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 006-INT.1:** Hypothesis\n\n\n\nVarious theories have been advanced within the French, Spanish, Italian and Greek speaking branches regarding the nature of SCP-006-INT. Among the theories advanced, those presented below are the most accepted within their respective branches.\n\n\n\n> +++ Hypothesis SCP-006-INT-FR\n\n> \n\n> //Submitted by Dr. Macro//\n\n> \n\n> Before trying to understand why buildings appear at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea, it is necessary to know what Magonia is.\n\n> \n\n> Magonia is a region of the world hidden in the clouds by means of various anomalous stratagems. It was highlighted by Agobard of Lyon in 815 in his treatise //De grandine et tonitruis//, which objected to its existence. However, its existence was proven by Napoleon's Singular Imperial Academy, centuries later. The SIA also discovered that Magonia was no longer located over France, but over the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n> \n\n> Now abandoned, under the effect of global warming, the clouds that made up Magonia are gradually disappearing, letting its buildings fall into the sea. This phenomenon would generate a mist that overhangs the surface of the sea, which hinders the sight of the buildings falling.\n\n\n\n> +++ Hypothesis SCP-006-INT-ES\n\n> \n\n> //Submitted by Dr. D\u00edaz//\n\n> \n\n> I consider that the Tartessians would be the most suitable civilization for the western segment of SCP-006-INT, if not the entire Mediterranean. Although their territory covered southern Spain, it is known that they were influenced by the Phoenicians and Greeks, both highly influential civilizations. However, hardly any sources of their reign and beliefs are preserved, the latter being attributed to pagan gods such as Baal, Astarte or Melkart.\n\n> \n\n> However, we must stick to the facts, which is the border of SCP-006-INT. The most distant remains are in the Strait of Gibraltar. This would not be remarkable if it were not for another important piece of Greek mythology, namely the Twelve Labors of Hercules.\n\n> \n\n> The tenth of them was the defeat of Geryon and the return of his cattle to Mycenae. According to the texts associated to the legend, it was located in the disappeared archipelago of the Gadeiras, place of the current Cadiz. This location as well as the discovery of one of the columns in the Rock of Gibraltar gives rise to the influence of the erection of the columns and a rise of the sea level in the Mediterranean due to anomalous causes.\n\n> \n\n> The Mediterranean Sea would be like a cemetery where periodically, the memory of the people who perished on what are now the seabed manifest themselves trying to reshape the ground to reform the villages they lived.\n\n\n\n> +++ Hypothesis SCP-006-INT-IT\n\n>\n\n> //Submitted by Dr. Italo//\n\n> \n\n> In the Roman culture as in the Greek one, there were more deities connected to the sea or more simply to the water, which may have originated from a contact occurred during the initial expansion of the Greek peoples and later of Rome in the Mediterranean, especially in the area of Magna Graecia.\n\n> \n\n> The aforementioned deities may have been created as a result of explaining the inhuman abilities of a marine population found in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n> \n\n> It cannot be excluded that the Romans like the Greeks may have undertaken, following a first conflict, a peaceful relationship with this population, allowing them to make technological and military progress.\n\n> \n\n> It cannot be ruled out that Rome, in order to expand its hegemony, slowly fought them until their population was reduced to a small number.\n\n> \n\n> The last survivors would have settled inside a complex of caves under the level of the sea near the coasts of Sicily. Nowadays, an anomalous/geological event could have caused the subsidence of some parts of the cave. This phenomenon would lead to the gradual unveiling at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea of the cities that these individuals inhabited. A kind of Atlantis that we are only discovering today.\n\n\n\n> +++ Hypothesis SCP-006-INT-EL\n\n> \n\n> //Submitted by Dr. Spiropoulos//\n\n> \n\n> Although Dr. Italo's sort of Atlantis theory is compelling, another answer is possible. At the end of the Bronze Age, Egypt was attacked by an unknown tribe of sea warriors, the Sea Peoples, who possessed strength and power unmatched at the time. No one really knows where they came from or how advanced they were. We can only speculate. However, we know that their archipelagos contained many anomalous cloaking technologies, allowing them to make their islands invisible and to avoid wars.\n\n> \n\n> Perhaps their island sank and the survivors turned to piracy and eventually to conquest, before disappearing and never being heard from again. In the event that these islands were sunk, it is possible that their anomalous cloaking devices were still active. Nowadays, these devices would have expired, making them reveal again. Perhaps this new discovery will shed light on their origins and give us answers to this age-old mystery.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 006-INT.2:** Recent Discovery\n\n\n\nIt has been observed that at regular intervals, several objects floating on the surface of the Mediterranean Sea, above sites with instances of SCP-006-INT, are being swept to the bottom.

The object exists in the form of four (4) individual instances (\u03b1 (4.5 kilograms), \u03b2 (8.5 kilograms), \u03b3 (6.5 kilograms), and \u03b4 (15.5 kilograms) completely comprised thereof. These constructs are capable of complex movement and can reach speeds of ~25 kilometres per hour<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-4\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')\">4</a></sup>. Additionally, the object acts as a superacid<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-5\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')\">5</a></sup> when interacting with animal matter. While inert in an environment without the presence of oxygen SCP-007-INT will enter a state analogous to hibernation. The longevity of SCP-007-INT instances is currently unknown given their self-renewal mechanisms.</p>\n<p>Instances of SCP-007-INT lack nuclei and tissue components, presenting themselves as amorphous amalgams centred around imaginary cores. The object possesses an idiosyncratic physical model, with ordinary fluid mechanics (such as characteristics of a Newtonian fluid, and a gel) in conjunction with anomalous environmental interactions (such as the capability of levitating upwards to two (2) metres from its initial position despite being heavier than the air).</p>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-right\" style=\"width:300px;\"><img alt=\"Liquid_helium_Rollin_film_stringless.jpg\" class=\"image\" src=\"http://scp-int-sandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/annemo-s-atelier/Liquid_helium_Rollin_film_stringless.jpg\" style=\"width:300px;\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width:300px;\">\n<p>An instance of SCP-007-INT constructing itself as a sphere.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Consequently, SCP-007-INT may be manipulated through hydraulic pressure into different shapes and sizes (by expanding or compressing itself) with variable physical characteristics (peculiarities such as viscosity, and sharpness), ranging from known ideal and abstract objects/shapes/geometrical formats to additional appendages such as pseudopods.</p>\n<p>SCP-007-INT possesses a specific strength ten (10) times higher than that of stainless steel<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-6\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')\">6</a></sup>; is resilient to a number of physical hazards, including resistance to temperatures (between 80 \u00baC to -80 \u00baC), kinetic, and stress damage.

Instances are capable of reparting the exceeding mass into ephemeral copies of themselves (though with lessened qualities). Additionally, instances of SCP-007-INT can reproduce asexually through a process similar to mitosis by using the additional synthesized mass; the circumstances associated with such an event are under scrutiny<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-8\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')\">8</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>SCP-007-INT displays a degree of consciousness, sentience, and sapience. It is capable of exhibiting reactions to stimuli associated with visual, olfactory, and auditory systems (these pseudo-systems are homogeneously distributed throughout SCP-007-INT's physical form); memorising, and learning (through habituation, observational and social means). The object employs a process of Heuristics to rationalise solutions.

Something about the fascists producing anomalous weaponry. Our detachment was pretty advanced in Massarosa, yeah. We were the vanguard and the reconnaissance team. Neat, uh? It'd be cooler if we weren't the only ones available for the job.</p>\n<p>Yes, everything went alright until the moment a man appeared with some sort of balloon floating ominously near himself. Didn't seem like a Regio Esercito uniform, had this type of full-body suit, no, it wasn't an armour but reminded me of one of those beekeeper vests, you know?</p>\n<p>Anyways, so the man started pointing at us, and saying something in Italian; I think he told us to fuck off or something. Naturally, we opened fire, no fascist is going to tell us what to do, a real one at that! The thing is, that balloon thing just spread itself in front of him like a sheet or something. Our bullets just hit it flat, the thing didn't even flinch or something.</p>\n<p>So we shot it more. And then it shot us. Not kidding, the thing just hurled into us! Crashed on [REDACTED], and started to absorb the poor guy. I still remember his screams. We changed magazines as fast as we could but that Italian man started running away; so we sent our tacit goodbye to [REDACTED], right in the dome, and started the pursuit.</p>\n<p>It's hard to follow a guy in narrow labyrinthic streets, even worse when you have an apparently unstoppable murder machine following you. Thank God that shit couldn't get much speed. We pretty much fucked the stealth up but that thing didn't seem to mind wasting time eating some Fascists; bless indiscriminate murder, I guess.</p>\n<p>Due to a stroke of luck, we managed to pepper him with some bullets. Guy left a trail of blood for us to follow. Not-so-lucky, that fucking thing stormed through a house, now enormous, and rendezvoused with him. We hoped the guy would die due to blood loss or something so we stood back as he ran away.</p>\n<p>Not long after, we resumed the search. Funny thing, we found smaller versions of that balloon thingie going around the streets, those died with bullets for some reason. Our shots shredded them or something. We decided not to touch it, given what happened with [REDACTED].</p>\n<p>Then, we found the entrance to a cellar. got down some stairs to a type of laboratory, if you could even call the place that. Found the guy patching himself up, a briefcase, and a huge air cylinder next to him. He said more shit so we shot him. Right, dead men can't be interrogated but it was complete self-defense, the guy had a gun, probably insulted our mothers, and the man-eating balloon of death thing was nowhere to be seen.</p>\n<p>The place had some sort of tunnel leading out of the village, and a small cart to carry the cylinder. We searched around, found some documents, and with a little effort to understand Italian \u2014 mind you, it is harder than you think \u2014 we realized that our mission was complete. Seized the whole thing, and dispatched it to Brazil.</p>\n<p>Better have that thing in our hands instead of some crazy Fascist or Nazi, right?</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>\u2014 [REDACTED]</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">+\u00a0Communications\u00a0between\u00a0the\u00a0CL5\u00a0Council\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0S5\u00a0Council.</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">-\u00a0Communications\u00a0between\u00a0the\u00a0CL5\u00a0Council\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0S5\u00a0Council.</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<div style=\"display: inline-block ; border : solid 1px #444444 ; background :#F5F5F5 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:120%;\">SITE PT1</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:110%;\">OVERWATCH COUNCIL</span></strong><br/>\n<strong><span style=\"font-size:110%;\">CABINET OFFICE</span></strong></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:110%;\"><strong>EXTRAORDINARY COMMUNIQU\u00c9 FROM THE LUSOPHONE BOARD OF DIRECTORS</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>Excellent S5-6,</p>\n<p>and the other members of the Superintendent Council.</p>\n<p>This missive is accompanied by our best regards, a cache containing an object of interest with the appended documentation, including the byproducts of our research.</p>\n<p>We consider that these items of interest possess a notorious historical and scientific value for the Italophone Office of the Foundation; an intriguing anomaly pertaining to your predecessors that was recovered by the Brazilian Expeditionary Force.</p>\n<p>Given the circumstances, we decided to update its designation to <em>SCP-007-INT</em>.</p>\n<p>Cordially,</p>\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size:70%;\"><strong>THIS DOCUMENT HAS BEEN ELECTRONICALLY SIGNED BY THE SIXTH DIRECTOR OF THE LUSOPHONE BOARD OF DIRECTORS \u2014 CL5-6.</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n<hr/></div>\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"display: inline-block ; border : solid 1px #444444 ; background :#F5F5F5 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:120%;\">SITE VITTORIA</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:110%;\">SUPERINTENDENT COMMAND</span></strong><br/>\n<strong><span style=\"font-size:110%;\">SUPERINTENDENT OFFICE</span></strong></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:110%;\"><strong>MINUTES OF INTERNATIONAL COMMUNICATION FROM THE SUPERINDENT COUNCIL</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>Esteemed CL5-6</p>\n<p>I wish to thank you and the rest of the O4 Council for the letter and the cache you sent us.

Hazardous materials (HAZMAT) suits, equipped with self-contained breathing apparatuses, adapted as NIJ Level II body armours[[footnote]]Body armour capable of protecting against 9 mm and .357 Magnum projectiles at velocities of up to 398m/s \u00b1 9.1 m/s, and 436 m/s \u00b1 9.1 m/s, respectively.[[/footnote]] rated level 2 in knife resistance and spike protection[[footnote]]Body armour capable of protecting against strike energies up to 50 joules.[[/footnote]], and electroshock weaponry, are available for the rapid response containment teams. \n\n\n\nThe vacuum cylinders and the containers are equipped with safety mechanisms accessible only to personnel with Clearance Level 3/007-INT. A minimum of one (1) individual capable of controlling the specific instance of SCP-007-INT must be present intermittently throughout testing periods. Deployment of SCP-007-INT may only occur inside the particular testing course developed for the object or in extraordinary circumstances of field use sanctioned by the Lusophone Board of Directors or the Superintendence of the Italian Branch.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, in the case of containment failure, and if no eligible Operators are available to restrain the object inside its cylinder, instances of SCP-007-INT may be forced into its training course which may be turned into a temporary vacuum chamber.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-007-INT designates an intelligent, highly adaptable, translucent, perpetually congealed substance that exhibits extraordinary plastic malleability. The object exists in the form of four (4) individual instances (\u03b1 (4.5 kilograms), \u03b2 (8.5 kilograms), \u03b3 (6.5 kilograms), and \u03b4 (15.5 kilograms) completely comprised thereof. These constructs are capable of complex movement and can reach speeds of ~25 kilometres per hour[[footnote]]The object itself possesses an outstanding capability to build kinetic energy through its movement speed.[[/footnote]]. Additionally, the object acts as a superacid[[footnote]]As per the modern definition, a superacid is a medium that presents the chemical potential of its protons as higher than that of pure sulfuric acid.[[/footnote]] when interacting with animal matter. While inert in an environment without the presence of oxygen SCP-007-INT will enter a state analogous to hibernation. The longevity of SCP-007-INT instances is currently unknown given their self-renewal mechanisms. \n\n\n\nInstances of SCP-007-INT lack nuclei and tissue components, presenting themselves as amorphous amalgams centred around imaginary cores. The object possesses an idiosyncratic physical model, with ordinary fluid mechanics (such as characteristics of a Newtonian fluid, and a gel) in conjunction with anomalous environmental interactions (such as the capability of levitating upwards to two (2) metres from its initial position despite being heavier than the air).\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> name=http://scp-int-sandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/annemo-s-atelier/Liquid_helium_Rollin_film_stringless.jpg|caption=An instance of SCP-007-INT constructing itself as a sphere.|width=300px]]\n\n\n\nConsequently, SCP-007-INT may be manipulated through hydraulic pressure into different shapes and sizes (by expanding or compressing itself) with variable physical characteristics (peculiarities such as viscosity, and sharpness), ranging from known ideal and abstract objects/shapes/geometrical formats to additional appendages such as pseudopods. \n\n\n\nSCP-007-INT possesses a specific strength ten (10) times higher than that of stainless steel[[footnote]]613 kNm/kg.[[/footnote]]; is resilient to a number of physical hazards, including resistance to temperatures (between 80 \u00baC to -80 \u00baC), kinetic, and stress damage. SCP-007-INT is exceptionally weak to electrical damage, attaining only temporary resistance[[footnote]]Ranging between ~30 and ~90 seconds.[[/footnote]] to electricity-based stress after being subjected to the hazard. \n\n\n\nDirect physical interactions between SCP-007-INT, and organisms pertaining to the Metazoa biological kingdom, including its several phyla, and some species of\u00a0\u00a0Fungi, SCP-007-INT demonstrates properties similar to that of superacid digestive fluids, and the digestive process itself.\n\n\n\nThe process synthesizes matter into a temporary mass in addition to an instance's original structure; exceeding mass decays at a rate of ~.5 kilograms per hour without creating detritus or byproduct. Instances are capable of reparting the exceeding mass into ephemeral copies of themselves (though with lessened qualities). Additionally, instances of SCP-007-INT can reproduce asexually through a process similar to mitosis by using the additional synthesized mass; the circumstances associated with such an event are under scrutiny[[footnote]]Instance \u03b1 created Instance \u03b2 asexually after consuming several kilograms of matter during an experiment conducted in Site Vittoria (see Experimental Log for details). The circumstances of the event were replicated but reproduction was unsuccessful.[[/footnote]].\n\n\n\nSCP-007-INT displays a degree of consciousness, sentience, and sapience. It is capable of exhibiting reactions to stimuli associated with visual, olfactory, and auditory systems (these pseudo-systems are homogeneously distributed throughout SCP-007-INT's physical form); memorising, and learning (through habituation, observational and social means). The object employs a process of Heuristics to rationalise solutions. Different instances display different peculiarities, such as a fondness for certain objects of affection thereof[[footnote]]It is apparent that instances of SCP-007-INT are aware of their lethality, and will not attempt to initiate physical contact with animals to display endearment.[[/footnote]].\n\n\n\nMoreover, instances of SCP-007-INT are capable of forming relationships with certain individuals through a tacit contractual connection. Once this specific form of relationship is established, the respective instance of SCP-007-INT will rescind from its ordinary behaviour, and adapt to psychophysical inputs of the selected individual designated an \"Operator\".\n\n\n\nOperators are capable of instructing the object omnidirectionally even without a line of sight with SCP-007-INT instances as long as the respective instance of SCP-007-INT they have established a connection to remains within a 40-metre range of the controller. Only one (1) Operator per instance may take active control thereof but several may exist at a time. Control can be transferred to another eligible Operator.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Field Report: Recovery.\" hide=\"- Field Report: Recovery.\"]]\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block ; border : solid 1px #444444 ; background :#F5F5F5 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n**[[size 120%]]SITE PT7[[/size]]**\n\n\n\n@@@@\n\n\n\n**[[size 110%]]DEPARTAMENT OF ARCHIVOLOGY**[[/size]]\n\n**[[size 110%]]COORDINATION OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC ARCHIVES**[[/size]]\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n[[size 110%]]**TRANSCRIPTION LOG FOR THE OPERATIONAL REPORT NR 6 FROM THE TASK-FORCE \"SMOKING [ANOMALOUS] SNAKES\"**[[/size]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\nI remember that day. Something about the fascists producing anomalous weaponry. Our detachment was pretty advanced in Massarosa, yeah. We were the vanguard and the reconnaissance team. Neat, uh? It'd be cooler if we weren't the only ones available for the job.\n\n\n\nYes, everything went alright until the moment a man appeared with some sort of balloon floating ominously near himself. Didn't seem like a Regio Esercito uniform, had this type of full-body suit, no, it wasn't an armour but reminded me of one of those beekeeper vests, you know?\n\n\n\nAnyways, so the man started pointing at us, and saying something in Italian; I think he told us to fuck off or something. Naturally, we opened fire, no fascist is going to tell us what to do, a real one at that! The thing is, that balloon thing just spread itself in front of him like a sheet or something. Our bullets just hit it flat, the thing didn't even flinch or something. \n\n\n\nSo we shot it more. And then it shot us. Not kidding, the thing just hurled into us! Crashed on [REDACTED], and started to absorb the poor guy. I still remember his screams. We changed magazines as fast as we could but that Italian man started running away; so we sent our tacit goodbye to [REDACTED], right in the dome, and started the pursuit.\n\n\n\nIt's hard to follow a guy in narrow labyrinthic streets, even worse when you have an apparently unstoppable murder machine following you. Thank God that shit couldn't get much speed. We pretty much fucked the stealth up but that thing didn't seem to mind wasting time eating some Fascists; bless indiscriminate murder, I guess. \n\n\n\nDue to a stroke of luck, we managed to pepper him with some bullets. Guy left a trail of blood for us to follow. Not-so-lucky, that fucking thing stormed through a house, now enormous, and rendezvoused with him. We hoped the guy would die due to blood loss or something so we stood back as he ran away.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nNot long after, we resumed the search. Funny thing, we found smaller versions of that balloon thingie going around the streets, those died with bullets for some reason. Our shots shredded them or something. We decided not to touch it, given what happened with [REDACTED]. \n\n\n\nThen, we found the entrance to a cellar. got down some stairs to a type of laboratory, if you could even call the place that. Found the guy patching himself up, a briefcase, and a huge air cylinder next to him. He said more shit so we shot him. Right, dead men can't be interrogated but it was complete self-defense, the guy had a gun, probably insulted our mothers, and the man-eating balloon of death thing was nowhere to be seen.\n\n\n\nThe place had some sort of tunnel leading out of the village, and a small cart to carry the cylinder. We searched around, found some documents, and with a little effort to understand Italian -- mind you, it is harder than you think -- we realized that our mission was complete. Seized the whole thing, and dispatched it to Brazil. \n\n\n\nBetter have that thing in our hands instead of some crazy Fascist or Nazi, right? \n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n-- [REDACTED]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Communications between the CL5 Council and the S5 Council.\" hide=\"- Communications between the CL5 Council and the S5 Council.\"]]\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block ; border : solid 1px #444444 ; background :#F5F5F5 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n**[[size 120%]]SITE PT1[[/size]]**\n\n\n\n@@@@\n\n\n\n**[[size 110%]]OVERWATCH COUNCIL**[[/size]]\n\n**[[size 110%]]CABINET OFFICE**[[/size]]\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n[[size 110%]]**EXTRAORDINARY COMMUNIQU\u00c9 FROM THE LUSOPHONE BOARD OF DIRECTORS**[[/size]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nExcellent S5-6,\n\n\n\nand the other members of the Superintendent Council.\n\n\n\nThis missive is accompanied by our best regards, a cache containing an object of interest with the appended documentation, including the byproducts of our research. \n\n\n\nWe consider that these items of interest possess a notorious historical and scientific value for the Italophone Office of the Foundation; an intriguing anomaly pertaining to your predecessors that was recovered by the Brazilian Expeditionary Force.\n\n\n\nGiven the circumstances, we decided to update its designation to //SCP-007-INT//.\n\n\n\nCordially, \n\n\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[size 70%]]**THIS DOCUMENT HAS BEEN ELECTRONICALLY SIGNED BY THE SIXTH DIRECTOR OF THE LUSOPHONE BOARD OF DIRECTORS -- CL5-6.**[[/size]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n------\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block ; border : solid 1px #444444 ; background :#F5F5F5 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n**[[size 120%]]SITE VITTORIA[[/size]]**\n\n\n\n@@@@\n\n\n\n**[[size 110%]]SUPERINTENDENT COMMAND**[[/size]]\n\n**[[size 110%]]SUPERINTENDENT OFFICE**[[/size]]\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n[[size 110%]]**MINUTES OF INTERNATIONAL COMMUNICATION FROM THE SUPERINDENT COUNCIL**[[/size]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nEsteemed CL5-6\n\n\n\nI wish to thank you and the rest of the O4 Council for the letter and the cache you sent us.

One captive survived, though they are currently under animated suspension through thaumaturgic means.\n\n\n\nNew security measures are being devised while the current measures are being revised.\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n//-- Captain Alberto Oliveira//\n\n[[/>]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n------\n", "references": ["scp-008-int"], "scp": "SCP-007-INT", "scp_number": 7, "series": "international", "tags": ["_cc", "_int", "adaptive", "alive", "amorphous", "co-authored", "corrosive", "euclid", "international", "sapient", "scp", "sentient"], "title": "SCP-007-INT", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-007-int"}, "SCP-011-DE": {"created_at": "2018-10-18T05:46:00", "creator": "INT_Translator", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "INT_Translator", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/int-translator", "comment": "Parent page set to: \"scp-international\".", "date": "2018-10-18T05:46:00"}, {"author": "INT_Translator", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/int-translator", "comment": "Added tags: computer, euclid, foundation-made, international, media, sapient, scp, sentient.

D-01121 has been convicted for 20 years due to her participation in a cannabis traffic gang, as a transporter</em>.<br/>\n<strong>[Begin Log]</strong><br/>\n<strong>Dr. Martins:</strong> Do you feel like you had any general, or significative change in your life, during these years since you've travelled to the Amazon?<br/>\n<strong>D-01121:</strong> Uh, I don't know, doctor. Other than reading, and going to the gym, I don't know, I think I'm more tranquil, in general. Since then I've been feeling more optimistic about being imprisoned, and everything else, after I comply with my sentence I'll try to stay in line. <em>[pause]</em> Did I answer that right?<br/>\n<strong>Dr. Martins:</strong> Did you, by any chance, feel any type of inspiration, something that encouraged you with these tasks?<br/>\n<strong>D-01121:</strong> Look, being imprisoned in here sucks, right, if you just stop, your mind kills you. I don't know, if I need to say what made me uh, go to the gym more, I'd say that it is because of those girls from Sector 7.<br/>\n<strong>D-01121:</strong> I dunno what you guys put in their dinners that gives them those arms bigger than my head. I'm serious, doctor, give me that thing, too. I know I'm already great because like, look at this butt; although I'd accept becoming a Frankenstein to gain those massive arms. <em>[laugh]</em><br/>\n<strong>Dr. Martins:</strong> I understand. You mentioned before something about 'reading more', has it been encouraged by something else?<br/>\n<strong>D-01121:</strong> Um. Not that I remember, it is not like I woke up one day, and thought \"What a beautiful day, today I'll stop being such a sucker\".<br/>\n<strong>D-01121:</strong> No, wait, there has been something, yes. I don't remember when but I started remembering quite a lot about when I had about 14, I think, I was listening to the radio in the balcony while I swept for my grandma, and then a sort of MPB<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-7\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')\">7</a></sup> music started playing, from a singer with a shy voice.<br/>\n<strong>D-01121:</strong> The music was about her trying to talk with an owl, saying that she was going to sing in every existent language until the owl responded but nothing worked, and, she ends up screaming so much, so much in sadness, that she ends up without her voice. So, right in the ending of the music, the little bird answers her and teaches her how to whistle, and it ends with the two whistling together.<br/>\n<strong>D-01121:</strong> There was a verse like, \"Little owl, my friend, when I saw you I fell in love, Hello, Bonjour, Entschuldigung. But you pretend to not see me, do not answer me, doesn't even care\". I remembered these parts with foreign words in the music, and I just dunno, I felt like learning more stuff, in general.<br/>\n<strong>Dr. Martins:</strong> Do you remember the name of the music, singer, or the radio station?<br/>\n<strong>D-01121:</strong> Sheesh, I wish, every time I try to remember it my mind goes blank. I think I've already asked everyone that I told about the music but I dunno, might've not stuck back then. I don't remember having heard it more than once.<br/>\n<strong>D-01121:</strong> Ah, doctor, about that thing of inspiration, I should've told about Marcela, too.<br/>\n<strong>Dr. Martins:</strong> Marcela?<br/>\n<strong>D-01121:</strong> Yes.<br/>\n<strong>D-01121:</strong> You know, doctor, I wasn't literate when I was a child. I had to work in parents\u2019 houses since I was young, so parents became bosses, bosses became the thing with the weed, you know the deal.<br/>\n<strong>D-01121:</strong> I joked before saying I was a sucker, but like, I've never felt lesser than anyone who had gone to school. My grandma always said that being smart comes from living, you know, sweating, and learning with hardship, and that's how I learnt how to \u2014 how to do things, talking, and listening. I know I'm smarter than some ma'ams that haven't been humiliated ever, never scrubbed the floor with a toothbrush so they wouldn't starve.<br/>\n<strong>D-01121:</strong> But staying here, and in the other sector, I've met lots of people, people that gave the desire of becoming more realized, more open-minded. Do you know that girl, sort of slender, from the 4, with glasses? So, she's Marcela. She's my best friend.<br/>\n<strong>D-01121:</strong> I've known her for a year, sort of. When she arrived here she had already gone through 10 years but she came alone, didn't talk with other people, that kind of thing.<br/>\n<strong>D-01121:</strong> So, I saw her by herself, and I dunno, I felt like approaching, take the first step that nobody took. And like, we had a basic chit-chat but she was at another level, she tried to talk about some books that she read because she went a lot to the library, a real lot, but I always got so nervous about those philosophical things, that I would start laughing, and I'd say: \"Fuck, Marcela, talk in my language, gal!\" <em>[laughter]</em><br/>\n<strong>D-01121:</strong> But like, I didn't want to get away from her, you know.<br/>\n<strong>D-01121:</strong> I think that her life story is really touching. She went through a lot of heavy stuff during her life, had to do some stuff for some weird people but ended up addicted to crack, and got busted. Said she was so desperate that she tried to rob a market with a fishmonger, and ended cutting off the finger of a guard, crazy. She tries to talk with her son in Bahia, he must be, like, 25 years already but he doesn't answer, it makes her very sad.<br/>\n<strong>D-01121:</strong> <em>[pause]</em> You know that story about the fishmonger, she tells about it laughing but when you know her for real, you can see she is very ashamed of that. I think a lot of the girls here that keep bragging about stealing that guy and killing that other guy have a hidden burden, in their soul, really, that they are too ashamed to admit to God.<br/>\n<strong>D-01121:</strong> But then, I didn't want to leave her excluded again just because we didn't understand each other right, eh. So, one day I told her, \"Fuck, gal, what if I enroll in that preparatory course that they host here? Then I'd understand what you say and everything\".<br/>\n<strong>D-01121:</strong> I was expecting her to laugh at my face but she got really excited. Kept saying she would help me, would test everything I learnt, and you know, it was a great help. By myself, I already did a fucking lot, but she gave me a lot of moral. Managed to get my degree in 10 months, I read everything, argued complex stuff with Marcela, and the other people in the library. Since I got educated, I feel a much more realized woman, more like a warrior.<br/>\n<strong>Dr. Martins:</strong> That's great, You seem to admire <em>Marcela</em> a great deal.<br/>\n<strong>D-01121:</strong> Talking like that so it seems <em>[laughter]</em>. Being sincere, I am a bit reserved when it comes to expressing myself but I tell her, right at her face, that she is a great fuckin' woman because it is true! She doesn't tell me how much longer she'll be here but I told her \"Gal, if I get out before, I swear to you that'll wait for you out there\" because I want to help her talk with her boy, with her little bird in Bahia. And if it doesn't work, I'll support her in any way I can because I want to help her step up in life, keep her clean, those things. Maybe even live together so we can keep an eye on each other, share a little apartment. I believe I owe her that, support her like she supported me.<br/>\n<strong>[End Log]</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div id=\"wiki-tab-0-1\" style=\"display:none\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. \u00c1lvarez<br/>\n<strong>Interviewed:</strong> Ms. Ramos<br/>\n<strong>Foreword:</strong> <em>In order to collect results regarding the effects of -3 on individuals without previous illegal activities, researchers of 011-PT were authorized to announce discounts for experimental hydrotherapies (as a facade company) in newsletters to recruit subjects to participate willingly in experiments.

You - could you help me? Ask something more precise, about my career, house. So, my memories can flow better.<br/>\n<strong>Dr. \u00c1lvarez:</strong> Is there any point, as in, any moment that you can define as the beginning of that \"complete change\" that occurred in your life?<br/>\n<strong>Ms. Ramos:</strong> Let me think\u2026 <em>[pause]</em> I think it was when\u2026 <em>[pause]</em> No, it was before if I think about it well enough. I believe it started when I began thinking a lot about a painting I saw in a thrift store.<br/>\n<strong>Dr. \u00c1lvarez:</strong> Painting?<br/>\n<strong>Ms. Ramos:</strong> The painting was somewhat Rococo, like, with two ladies\u2026 you couldn't see their faces but they were ladies. One of them, in the front of the painting, was sideways with her face turned back, her hand appearing in the frame, cutting her hair really short, by her ear. So, while she does that, another lady \u2014 she kissed the other lady, in front of her, as she puts her hand in the face of the first. You can't quite see the kiss, but like, all that pose isn't of someone kissing the cheek, at least for me.<br/>\n<strong>Ms. Ramos:</strong> These ladies, they were pretty. Dark skin like me and you but the one behind had an aura, a white light around her head like those depictions of saints. The one in front was dressed in a suit with a brilliant effect, it resembled stars. Their faces didn't appear quite right but I felt that they were smiling.<br/>\n<strong>Dr. \u00c1lvarez:</strong> It is a really beautiful painting, I imagine.<br/>\n<strong>Ms. Ramos:</strong> Yeah. I think I saw that picture when I was about 15, around there, but only these years after the travel I remembered how beautiful it was. A very sympathetic man told me once that good art is that which inspires you, that touches us, humans\u2026 that's what I feel for that picture, it's like it spoke to me, you know. <em>[pause]</em> It told me that women can do those things, know, that they can like each other in that way.<br/>\n<strong>Ms. Ramos:</strong> Did you know that, doctor? I believe there are a lot of people that don't even think about it, at least not the people I spoke with at first.<br/>\n<strong>Dr. \u00c1lvarez:</strong> I believe that there still exists a certain taboo about relationships of these types, sadly. Would you like to talk about these conversations, with those individuals?<br/>\n<strong>Ms. Ramos:</strong> I can try, I don't know if you'll understand because there are some things that give context the whole story, at least for the particular motive for me thinking like that. And I don't know if you - if you wanna hear about that. A lot of people that I spoke with kept looking at me as if I was crazy, so I don't know if I should talk, even if you're a professional, and everything else.<br/>\n<strong>Dr. \u00c1lvarez:</strong> Well, you can trust that I'll deal with any sensitive information in the most professional, and comprehensive manner possible.<br/>\n<strong>Ms. Ramos:</strong> Alright then, I'll try. <em>[pause]</em> I was abused when I was younger - when I had about 7. My stepfather, a disgraceful man, disgusting, drunk, that beat women without pity, he abused me. Never did it directly, you know. But he touched me, doctor. He stunk, never stopped stinking. I swear, I swear to you, I'll never forget that heinous man, he was the pure essence of Satan but at that time, I wasn't conscious of it. I thought I had made something wrong for him to do that to me. That I was a tainted woman, being punished by the Lord.<br/>\n<strong>Ms. Ramos:</strong> So I spoke with my mother. I told my mother I felt dirty. I don't want to see your husband again, mother, I want to be locked. I don't want them looking at me, mother, I'll become a nun, I'll dedicate myself to the Lord alone. Mother heard me that day, and thanks to God she found a place for us to live in a small rented house owned by my fraternal aunt. I felt a little better then but I still felt suffocated due to hardships, I started to sleep sitting so I wouldn't wake in the middle of my sleep with the demon inside my head.<br/>\n<strong>Dr. \u00c1lvarez:</strong> I am sorry that you have experienced all that. Would you like a cup of water?<br/>\n<strong>Ms. Ramos:</strong> No doctor, it's alright, that's my life. I learnt to accept that it is my story. I just have to accept it, and not let it stay on my way anymore.<br/>\n<strong>Ms. Ramos:</strong> Alright then, so, my life kept going, I was growing up in the church with others telling me I'd find a good man to take the sadness from my heart but \u2014 I felt terrorized with the prospect of marriage, with lying with a man. A year ago, I think, I believe that I grew tired of locking that feeling inside my head, so I went to talk with the other girls from the church, to know if anyone else felt cornered like that, and if marrying really helped.<br/>\n<strong>Ms. Ramos:</strong> Two ladies that I talked with told me that ah, it was just like that, we accept those things for our husbands because that's right, that's a good woman. But there were two other girls - my friends Claudete, and Luana \u2014 they told me no, that they were scared, too, because they saw their mothers having a hard time, and they didn't want that to them because they wouldn't want to become housewives. But we didn't want to stray away from the Lord.<br/>\n<strong>Ms. Ramos:</strong> I told them that I had seen a beautiful picture a long time ago, with two women together. Wouldn't it be great if we could love, marry without needing rotten people in our life? Ah, doctor, they kept laughing but I was serious. They kept saying: \"Oh, I wouldn't, Gisele, that is weird, there's no such thing as a woman with another woman, no, take a step back\". I got quite angry with them laughing at me so I went to talk with my mother during that same day.<br/>\n<strong>Ms. Ramos:</strong> I told her about the conversation, and then said: so, I saw the painting, and so on, so doesn't it mean it is allowed? And she answered, no, God didn't plan that for you, we'll talk with the priest. And I felt extreme indignation because, how come? I've been told my whole life \u2014 that I was loved by the Lord, I followed His word to my 22 years, and now my mother says in front of me that I wasn't doing what He planned for me? Oh no. I got the courage, and told like this: \"ah, mother, I am certain that God loves me, and that's what He wants for me, and if I'm only able to lay with women, that's His plan for my life!\"<br/>\n<strong>Ms. Ramos:</strong> Look, doctor, you should've seen her face when I said that, I think it was the first that I raised my voice for her in my entire life. She screamed in tandem: \"if it is like that then you can take your belongings out of this house since I don't want my daughter mingling with women!\" <em>[laughter]</em> I don't know, doctor, it suddenly made me want to challenge her, so I said: \"Alright then\", and started packing my things.<br/>\n<strong>Ms. Ramos:</strong> You know, back then I thought that it was true if I wanted to mingle because I didn't even know what it meant but I felt that I had to do that due to my love for the Lord. I had much more certainty that He wanted me to do that, to own my <em>own</em> life.<br/>\n<strong>Ms. Ramos:</strong> Outside home, I quickly got employed taking care of a seigniory from the church that still liked me, and she allowed me to live in her place to help. My mother spread the word that she did not have a daughter anymore and pushed me away from the church but I still spoke with Claudete, and Luana by my telephone, and we tried to see each other in the weekend in the square next there.<br/>\n<strong>Ms. Ramos:</strong> While I live with Ms. C\u00e9lia she allowed me to use her computer to spend the time, study something, and I searched more about everything, for people that liked women, to make sure I was actually sure. <em>[laughter]</em> My eyes widened with some of the things I accessed by mistake but I knew I had the curiosity to learn about those things because of my age!<br/>\n<strong>Ms. Ramos:</strong> I commented about those things with my friends, and they got a little afraid, sometimes they said that I had to bless myself, so I answered \"no, the world is like that, guys, and I think that I'm like that, too, and I won't lay with any men, I decided\". I knew they thought I was quite weird because of those chats but they had the same curiosity that I had, and that's why they didn't stop talking with me. Anyways, one day Luana kissed me, saying that she wanted to see if it was actually good.<br/>\n<strong>Ms. Ramos:</strong> I didn't tell her that it was my first kiss with a woman, and I felt a little afraid. She sort of stopped talking with me after that but I think she figured out that it wasn't for her\u2026 I cried a lot for days until I got the courage to join these forums that I messed around, to talk. The women I found helped me a lot.<br/>\n<strong>Ms. Ramos:</strong> They helped me learn more about life as if they were second mothers. With them, I got my license, worked in a hotel, and then in a restaurant, rented a nice house. Met personally some of the ladies in one of the bars in the city, they were from the church, like me; we became friends and even made our own group for prayers. We started to dress differently, cutting our hair, wearing trousers, shorts, we had a lot of fun with the things the church said we couldn't do but we knew that God would accept us if we were happy.<br/>\n<strong>Ms. Ramos:</strong> So, about 3 months ago my Mother found me, and wanted to apologise. So I forgave her, of course, but I didn't come back home\u2026 now I felt free for real, you know?<br/>\n<strong>Ms. Ramos:</strong> In the past, I think that at that moment that I left home, and followed my own path, with my own faith, I didn't feel I was close to the Lord. Now I felt that in the depth of my heart, wearing men clothes, having intimacy with women like me. I didn't want to stray away from God again, feel dirty. So, I follow this path now, and\u2026 I'm happy, even if there are people that see me with crooked eyes, swearing, spitting on me. I love myself, and I know God loves me, too.<br/>\n<strong>[End Log]</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div id=\"wiki-tab-0-2\" style=\"display:none\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Martins<br/>\n<strong>Interviewed:</strong> Junior Researcher Vieira<br/>\n<strong>Foreword</strong> <em>A proposal regarding the possibility of evaluating the effects of SCP-011-PT-3 in individuals with previous knowledge about the expected behavioural changes, and whether this knowledge would result in effects related to those commonly registered.

Junior Researcher Vieira was granted access to 011-PT's documentation, and was observed during the period of one year.</em><br/>\n<strong>[Begin Log]</strong><br/>\n<strong>Dr. Martins:</strong> Do you remember the details regarding SCP-011-PT?<br/>\n<strong>Junior Researcher Vieira:</strong> Yes, I checked the archives on a weekly basis.<br/>\n<strong>Dr. Martins:</strong> Do you think that SCP-011-PT could have influenced any particular decision of your life, unconsciously or consciously?<br/>\n<strong>Junior Researcher Vieira:</strong> Maybe, maybe not. I mean, there was that thing about an allegory but I don't think that it ends up being\u2014<br/>\n<strong>Dr. Martins:</strong> My apologies but could you report that allegory, specifically? For the record.<br/>\n<strong>Junior Researcher Vieira:</strong> It was a miniseries about a nurse helping subversive groups during the Military Intervention, the plot being about them having conflicting reasons about what is right or not. Is the plot relevant for something? What you wanna know is if I had some type of epiphany, if I became a lesbian out of the blue, something like that, no?<br/>\n<strong>Dr. Martins:</strong> We want to know if you feel any significant change in your life and if that change has been provided by SCP-011-PT.<br/>\n<strong>Junior Researcher Vieira:</strong> But to what degree can we define this as something anomalous? The implementation of an artificial memory is an obvious anomaly, of course, but the influence of the memories by themselves is something that could be noticed with any type of significant event in the life of a woman, right? Or \u2014 anyone, really.<br/>\n<strong>Dr. Martins:</strong> Well. Despite perceiving those tendencies as a component of the anomaly, we never affirmed that it was something anomalous by itself. You know that, as scientists, we have the obligation to cite facts that may or may not be relevant to our research.<br/>\n<strong>Junior Researcher Vieira:</strong> Yes, I understand. But really, do you think that\u2026 that it can happen with anything else, any type of memory that created an impact in your thought process? About life, love.<br/>\n<strong>Junior Researcher Vieira:</strong> I mean, think about your aspirations when you were a kid. Have you never met someone, or watched a movie, or something akin that made you think: \"well, I want to be\u2026 I don't know, a veterinary. Well, there are so many people that die due to cancer, I wanna become a scientist so I can find the cure for it.\"<br/>\n<strong>Junior Researcher Vieira:</strong> It's the same for love, too, like any type of inherent beauty that you had never perceived, the basis of attraction. How does someone develop a \"type\"? From blondes to brunettes to\u2026 men, and women. I don't know.<br/>\n<strong>Dr. Martins:</strong> I don't think I'm following your line of thought.<br/>\n<strong>Junior Researcher Vieira:</strong> I just believe that\u2026 the effects of the anomaly are not inherent to the anomaly. Maybe they aren't even inherent of something significant, by itself. I believe that all women - including me, and you \u2014 possess the capability of becoming happy, and ambitious loving one another. It doesn't need to be something exclusive, nor lesbian with all the letters but\u2026 prioritizing the women in your life, in general. It's not something really thought about by the majority of people.<br/>\n<strong>Junior Researcher Vieira:</strong> Maybe the real effect of this skip isn't 'implanting' ideas, nor 'influencing', but suggesting them. I believe that the capability to love was already inside us all this time, and we just followed what was suggested, by our own volition. And, you know. Even with all the hardships, and sadness in our lives, our particular relationships, we are happier that way.<br/>\n<strong>Dr. Martins:</strong> It is something interesting to think about, although, don't you think that assuming something like that, so personal, and subjective, to women as a whole, is something too passionate?<br/>\n<strong>Junior Researcher Vieira:</strong> Huh, maybe. But I am full of passion, Martins. And I am sure that all the other women would be if they experienced that type of love.<br/>\n<strong>[End Log]</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n//<![CDATA[\nOZONE.dom.onDomReady(function(){\n        var tabViewa01d55bcb0107e0bf1f1108bdee0bfc0 = new YAHOO.widget.TabView('wiki-tabview-a01d55bcb0107e0bf1f1108bdee0bfc0');\n                }, \"dummy-ondomready-block\");\n        \n//]]>\n</script></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Report of Discovery and Recovery:</strong> The Foundation became aware of the existence of the anomalous activity caused by the object in the region because of incidents involving tourists disappearing between the months of March, and July after interacting with \"a lake full of lily pads that created ice, and had fluorescent lilies during the night\".</p>\n<p>SCP-011-PT has been documented for the first time in 18\u2588\u2588, dating the epoch of annexation of the Province of Amazon by the Brazil Empire government.

Two times per day, a pig <em>(Sus domestica)</em> is to be introduced in the cell to let SCP-015-IT feed.<br/>\nPersonnel assigned to SCP-015-IT must take psychological evaluations weekly and must be cycled every 3 months.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-015-IT is a humanoid entity around 1.9 meters tall, with hairless skin capable of absorbing 98% of incident light. Its face possesses no nose or external ears, and its eyes can emit light due to photophores placed on its iris. The mouth has 8 pointed teeth in each jaw, while the tongue (28\u00a0cm long) is forked; on both points there are two hollow needles directly connected to the esophagus. SCP-015-IT's arms are disproportionately long when compared to the body and the hands end with four clawed hands. Physically, SCP-015-IT appears to have reduced muscular mass; despite this, it is surprisingly strong and can easily subdue an adult human. SCP-015-IT is highly resilient to physical damage and can heal quickly from wounds and damage to internal organs.</p>\n<p>SCP-015-IT is predominantly active during the night and feeds exclusively on adrenaline and noradrenaline produced by mammals, with a preference for human prey. To procure them, SCP-015-IT developed a hunting method aimed at scaring its target as much as possible: usually, it hides in dark spots, trying to not be seen, and stalks its victim. If it is not spotted, SCP-015-IT waits until its prey is distracted and approaches it silently, before grabbing it and biting them on the side. The bite is not meant to kill the victim, but to use the large teeth as anchors while the tongue darts forward and sinks directly in the adrenal gland<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>; the adrenaline rich blood rich is aspirated through one of the needles, while the other expels it with the addition of a mild sedative. This allows SCP-015-IT to keep the prey immobile without wasting too much energy, and to leave undisturbed after its meal.</p>\n<p>Prolonged observation of SCP-015-IT causes psychic deterioration to exposed subjects, with auditive and visual hallucinations, panic attacks, and, in the most sensitive individuals, damage to the cardiovascular system; the first symptoms appear after two weeks, but this time is reduced if SCP-015-IT doesn't feed regularly; the cause of this phenomenon is currently unknown, but it is theorized it is a method to rend vulnerable preys that would be too strong or aggressive otherwise.</p>\n<p><strong>Recovery log:</strong> SCP-015-IT was captured on 22/05/2012, after the police of [DATA REDACTED], in the province of Caserta, received many reports of \"vampire\" attacks. Site Vittoria sent the <a href=\"http://scp-int.wikidot.com/squadre-speciali-mobili#SSM-IV\">SSM-IV</a> (<em>\"Pugnus Ferri\"</em>) to deal with the menace. Due to its unsuspected agility and its coloring which allowed it to hide in dark areas, SCP-015-IT managed to avoid capture until it was shot with a transmitter that allowed the Foundation to trace its position. When it was surrounded, SCP-015-IT reacted with unforeseen violence and was able to kill \u2588 soldiers and wound \u2588\u2588 before being subdued.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum SCP-015-IT-a:</strong> During his time undercover in the place SCP-015-IT was found, the agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 came in contact with a member of the <a href=\"http://scp-int.wikidot.com/gruppi-di-interesse#CCSG\">Confraternity of Saint George's Knights</a>. In an encounter between the two agents, it was revealed that the Confraternity had captured SCP-015-IT, but it escaped roughly two months before being contained by the Foundation. After receiving this information, the Director of Site Vittoria requested and obtained the CCSG's documents regarding SCP-015-IT. The most relevant passages are shown below.</p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">+\u00a0Extracts\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0documents\u00a0about\u00a0SCP-015-IT</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">-\u00a0Close</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<div class=\"content-panel standalone series\" style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">\n<p><strong>Demonic Type:</strong> Shadow Demon</p>\n<p><strong>Threat Level:</strong> <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Intermediate</span> Low</p>\n<p><strong>Physical Description:</strong> [\u2026]<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p><strong>Known Powers:</strong> Dia-212<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup> is highly unstable in our world: it feeds on the fear of its victims by drinking their blood, despite not requiring it to survive. This allows it to keep itself in a physical shape adapted to the limits imposed by mortal reality.<br/>\nIt also possesses notable physical strength and intelligence comparable to that of a human being; the creature uses these characteristics to hunt and escape its enemies. Another important property is its resistance to blessed weapons, which only manage to inflict minor damage compared to their full potential.</p>\n<p><strong>Note from Father Ilardi, 14/04/2011:</strong> <em>I am increasingly fascinated by the creature we have captured: despite its mere sight being repugnant beyond every limit, I'm starting to believe that its soul is gentle; I noticed that its screams are similar to a pained cry and that they get subside when I speak to it with a comforting tone.

I must find a way to communicate with it: it is my duty to bring back to the Lord every lost soul.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Note from Father Ilardi, 24/06/2011:</strong> <em>I can affirm with certainty that the Dia-212 is not completely evil: it showed great curiosity towards everything that was showed to it, and it does not harbor hatred or fear for holy objects. Initially, it was very distrustful and always drew back whenever I approached it, but not only did it never attack me, it also grew fond of me and my disciples. However, it pains me to admit that it remains fearful towards all those who wear the uniform of our Holy Order, perhaps because of the wounds it sustained during capture. I shall recommend to everyone to wear different clothing to not make it nervous, and to try a gentler approach with the creature.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Letter for Cardinal \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, dated 18/03/2012:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Most Illustrious Eminence,<br/>\nI am sorry to inform you about a serious accident that occurred during the night between the 15th and 16th of this month.

The locker is gas-tight and, as a precaution against unauthorized access, is flooded with the highly toxic and mask-breaking security-gas G/232SFD-E, which is removed in case of authorized access. Admission to SCP-018-DE requires approval by O4-4. The room is kept under surveillance using CCTV cameras lacking microphones, which are monitored by two independent, illiterate guards, incapable of lip-reading or any sign language. Guards are to remain unaware of the content and effect of SCP-018-DE. If they detect an unauthorized access attempt, they are to release G/232SFD-E into the room in which the locker is located. Unauthorized personnel in possession of SCP-018-DE are to be terminated instantly and without making any prior contact. SCP-018-DE may only be transported by a remote-controlled robot. Unauthorized use of SCP-018-DE is to be prevented by any and all means.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-018-DE is a piece of paper which has been cut approximately to an A5 format using scissors. It is printed with text in German declaring that the owner of the Object \"may do that\"<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>. It contains no evidence as to either the creator or source of the object. The signature is indecipherable. The reverse side of the object is blank.</p>\n<p>If the individual in possession of SCP-018-DE is asked to justify themselves or is caught committing a crime and shows SCP-018-DE, all people within four meters become convinced that the possessor of SCP-018-DE was authorized to act as they did. This effect also manifests in people who become aware of SCP-018-DE's content within ten minutes, be it via radio, media or by being told so by other affected. This effect is permanent and only reversible by the administration of amnestics. Affected individuals will try to justify the act to those not affected, and even attempt to protect the culprit with their lives and by using deadly force. The urge to protect the possessor of SCP-018-DE rises with the degree of contempt by authorities, media and the general public for the subject.</p>\n<p>If SCP-018-DE is stolen or lost, the effect on all individuals affected by the possessor vanishes within 48 hours, and they become aware of the severity of the possessor's crimes, as well as their own. In the event that the former possessor regains possession of SCP-018-DE, it can be used again. If it is regained before 48 hours have elapsed, the effect persists among all individuals still affected. If SCP-018-DE is voluntarily relinquished to somebody else, the effect also persists. A person gaining possession of SCP-018-DE will promptly become aware of its primary effect and feel an urge to use it.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum-1:</strong> This is a list of crimes and security-breaches committed by multiple individuals with the help of SCP-018-DE:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>247 cases of theft of goods, each worth below 1,000\u20ac</li>\n<li>12 cases of theft of goods, each worth between 1,000\u20ac and 100,000\u20ac</li>\n<li>2 cases of bank robbery, with captured goods worth ca. 4,000,000\u20ac</li>\n<li>7 cases of unauthorized accesses to the women's showers at a gym</li>\n<li>1 case of rape</li>\n<li>3 cases of murder of non-Foundation personnel</li>\n<li>4 cases of theft of anomalous objects in the possession of the Foundation in Germany</li>\n<li>The release of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588-DE (neutralized)</li>\n<li>The theft of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588-DE (regained)</li>\n<li>Leaking of 8\u00a0TB of data from the Foundations Database (neutralized)</li>\n<li>The murder of O4-\u2588</li>\n<li>[DATA EXPUNGED]</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Addendum-2:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>On the grounds of the danger posed by 018-DE falling into the wrong hands, I propose the neutralization of the object. Seriously, it's just paper, that much is proven. It burns. I know: we secure, we contain, we protect. But this thing has cost us an O4 already. How many others will have to die?</em> \u2014 Dr. Schwab</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>What about using SCP-018-DE for our goals instead? The GOC, authorities, politicians and all the other nutjobs wouldn't pose a problem anymore. We would just need trustworthy people and a fail-safe emergency plan.</em> \u2014 Dr. Brunnenberg</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Dr. Schwab's motion is hereby denied! The special containment procedures are sufficient. Just because it burns doesn't mean it's destructible. Just think of <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-682\">SCP-682</a>, which gets stronger with every attempt to destroy it, and trust me, you as the project manager do not want something like that. That's why we only neutralize SCPs in the case of an extreme emergency. Before you ask, no, it will stay Euclid.

The pipes connected to this structure must contain gratings with spaces of width less than 2\u00a0cm (0,06 ft); in addition, the outlet water must be heated to 78\u00b0C (172,4\u00b0F) to denature the toxins produced by SCP-019-IT. Once every two months, 35\u00a0kg (77\u00a0lb) of vegetable material must be introduced into the tank to allow the specimens of SCP-019-IT to feed themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-019-IT is a genetically modified species of marine organisms belonging to the <em>Echinoidea</em> class, commonly known as sea urchins. They are characterized by a round body that can reach a diameter of 14\u00a0cm (0.4 ft). There are no thorns on the body of SCP-019-IT, rather it posesses bumps that are connected to a venomous gland; when it feels threatened, SCP-019-IT releases from them a powerful neurotoxin in the surrounding area, which stimulates other specimens to release them in turn. The oral opening of SCP-019-IT has five sufficiently resistant bone-like plates to grind wood and small stones. SCP-019-IT is very adaptive and is capable of living in both fresh and salt water, at temperatures between -25\u00b0C (-13\u00b0F) and 60\u00b0C (140\u00b0F) and withstand pressures up to 48 atm (705 psi). SCP-019-IT can also enter a state of hibernation if there is not enough food for its subsistence.</p>\n<p>SCP-019-IT reproduces by budding: when a specimen of SCP-019-IT reaches a body mass of about 40\u00a0g (0,08\u00a0lb), some specialized cells present on the dorsal area begin to reproduce rapidly, forming a new individual that comes off once reached the mass of about 12\u00a0g (0,02\u00a0lb). The newborn can reproduce itself after only 36 hours if it has enough food.</p>\n<p>SCP-019-IT is capable of destroying entire ecosystems and cause the extinction of countless aquatic species in an extremely short time due to of its speed of reproduction, its adaptability and the lack of natural predators able to feed on it. For this reason, the SSM-II (\"Legio Atlantidis\") must investigate any news concerning SCP-019-IT and delete any specimen.</p>\n<p><strong>Recovery Log:</strong> A serious loss of fish occurred in 2016 in Marina di Sestri, Genova, attracted the attention of the Foundation, which sent the SSM-II to investigate. Analysis of seawater samples and fish carcasses revealed the presence of an unknown neurotoxin, particularly concentrated in an area about 400\u00a0m (1312 ft) from the coast. The area was explored through a modified 'Oceanus' drone that identified as a toxin source a large container resting on the seabed about 120\u00a0m (393 ft) deep. The SSM-II used a special ship to extract it and transport it to the Neptune Site, where it was opened; within it more than \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 specimens of SCP-019-IT were found. Twenty of them were contained to study them while the others were eliminated and incinerated.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note of Captain Basilio Aramini, commander of the SSM-II:</strong><br/>\nSCP-019-IT represents an immense threat: just imagine what would have happened if that container had been opened. For this reason, I request the installation along the Italian coasts of sensors able to identify the neurotoxin produced by SCP-019-IT so as to be able to trace the free specimens.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note from the Sixth Superintendent:</strong> The Council of S5 approves the request. The SSM-II can proceed with the creation and installation of the detectors both along the coasts and in the lake areas.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Addendum SCP-019-IT-A:</strong> During an SSM-IV (\"Pugnus Ferri\") raid, an aquarium containing four specimens of SCP-019-IT in a state of hibernation was found on a base of the \"Occult Fascist Council\". Further investigations led to the discovery of several encrypted documents concerning the creation and refinement of the entity, including a diary written by one of the researchers. The diary has been completely decoded, having been written with a relatively simple code; some pages are shown below.</p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">+\u00a0Extracts\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0documentation\u00a0on\u00a0SCP-019-IT</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">-\u00a0Close</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Date: 24/04/2016, page 1</strong><br/>\nToday there are new Chimeras from Base 9.

Then everything shook, and went black for a moment.</p>\n<p>The public rushed to the exit, screaming. They tried to exit but there was nowhere to go; the theatre was adrift, like some sort of ship. Even worse, onwards to a desolate place, the cold started biting at us. So they came back.</p>\n<p>After a short period of chaos, we decided to gather our wits, and make a plan. So, we took volunteers with some degree of courage, and intelligence to take the lead of the situation, and stepped on the parterre. We could transform the whole theatre into a ship or something, provide important things to people such as clothes, and food (if only we could fish), with some creativity.</p>\n<p>We gathered everyone, and managed to think about something; decided to announce to everyone else at the time of the next presentation, and so we did. Some looked at us in dismay, others cursed but most clapped, volunteered, and wished everyone the best of luck.</p>\n<p>So it happened.</p>\n<p>Those in the auditorium started to curl, complain, and cursed at us. At first, we thought that it was just a huge change of mind. We felt desolated. Then we realized that they were becoming like the ice just a few kilometres from us. They started freezing in place, becoming some sort of mannequin.</p>\n<p>We would've rushed to them. But we ourselves had been affected by that strange disease. Our fingers became ice, we lost our semblance. I don't know what is worse, being entrapped in this form with a mind of your own, or becoming a mindless statue-like our audience. The pain had cast everyone into inaction some, (as we had thought back then) thankfully, escaped that fate.</p>\n<p>What had we become?</p>\n<p>We started to devise plans to escape as soon as possible now that the theatre was inbound to that frozen wasteland but there was a problem. Every date in which we were supposed to have a presentation, and none happened, the frozen statues would start hooting us, alive again. We tried to make them cooperate but it only worsened. The floor between the auditorium started to crack, so after a time we couldn't even commute.</p>\n<p>Then one day, those things appeared from the crack. Devious creatures of ice, and ruthlessness that hunted us without mercy. We tried to run, we tried to hide but the only thing that would quell them were new presentations. A few of us had gathered to bid our goodbye by doing what we loved, what we wanted, only to be surprised by the lack of chaos and death.</p>\n<p>Of course, we kept repeating. We felt hunger or fatigue no more. If only we could gain time, and devise a way of escaping before everything froze but we had wasted too much time. Now wasting time is our routine, and we've come to hate what we do. Yet, something keeps forcing us to do it.</p>\n<p>I hate myself.<br/>\nI am so sorry.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"footnotes-footer\">\n<div class=\"title\">Footnotes</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-1\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-1')\">1</a>.

Should the glass dome be damaged, a D-Class subject equipped with a hazmat suit is to enter the room to assess the damage in order to have the glass dome replaced as soon as possible. Light repairs such as sealing off cracks or putting on mastic are not to be considered sufficient, and may only be carried out at the behest of Level 2 personnel for a limited amount of time.</p>\n<p>The exact vector by which SCP-024-FR affects human beings is still unknown, any affected personnel is to be immediately restrained with a straitjacket and placed in a standard hospital bed, under permanent medical surveillance. Their jaw is to be kept shut by force.</p>\n<p><strong>As of Incident 024-FR-21, personnel are not permitted to stay within the containment chamber longer than twenty (20) minutes, regardless of the protective clothing they are wearing.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-024-FR appears to be a normal Parisian ham sandwich, exhibiting a very large size, with an estimated diameter of 35cm and a length of 20cm. Observing the object has no effect as long as it is kept under its sealed glass bell jar. Therefore, it is assumed that the effect is due to a smell or non-transmissible pathogen infecting the subject, hereafter designated SCP-024-FR-1.</p>\n<p>The process described in Experience Log 024-1 is triggered at the first exposure to the object. The subject feels the urgent need to swallow SCP-024-FR all at once, regardless of the physical damage such an action would cause. One side of the sandwich is covered with a standard paper towel, which does not display the name of any restaurant or brand. Instead, an inscription reads \"Go ahead, U can Totali swalo Dat\", and, lower, \"Are We Tasty Yet?\". As such, the object is suspected to be linked to the pseudo-artistic Group of Interest <em>Are We Cool Yet?</em>. It was found laying on a dustbin in a back alley of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, next to the corpse of a homeless person who seemed to have [DATA EXPUNGED] his own jaw.</p>\n<p>As of 08/17/2012, by edict of the Ethics Committee (Letter 024CE65, archived), it is forbidden to expose any human being to SCP-024-FR. This limits current knowledge on the effects of the anomaly (attempts at exposing animals have been unsuccessful). This document is based on the circumstances of its recovery and on the following experience log:</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 024-21:</strong> An incident involving Dr Lears has led to a revaluation of the current containment procedures for SCP-024-FR, and new procedures are under review. For now, it is forbidden to expose personnel more than necessary, and only as part of constructive experiments approved by at least one Level 2 personnel. The only available description of the incident comes from Dr Lears' personal recorder. Transcript of the recording is attached to this document as Incident Log 024-LEARS-A8.</p>\n<p><strong>Experience Log 024-1, 08/14/2012:</strong> First and last exposure attempt of a D-Class (D-0568) to SCP-024-FR.</p>\n<p>D-0568 is wearing no protection, and is equipped with an earpiece to receive instructions from researchers, who are monitoring the room through the security camera. However, the procedure consisted of sending the D-Class subject into the containment chamber without precautions for exposure. T=0 designates the moment D-0568 began to show an interest in SCP-024-FR and is not to be considered accurate without further testing.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>T=-2min23:</strong> D-0568 enters the chamber, and approaches of the glass dome under which SCP-024-FR is placed, waiting for instructions.<br/>\n<strong>T=-1min57:</strong> D-0568 removes the glass dome and put it on the ground. D-0568 exhibits no particular behaviour and looks bored.<br/>\n<strong>T=0min00:</strong> D-0568 shows a keen interest in the object. He bends down, as if he is studying its length.<br/>\n<strong>T=2min06:</strong> D-0568 is now taking measures with his hands, visibly comparing its length, width and especially its diameter.<br/>\n<strong>T=3min11:</strong> D-0568 seems to be losing himself in an intense reflection, comparing the object's measurement with his jaw. Dr Baltin requests the immediate cessation of the experiment. Denied.<br/>\n<strong>T=3min24:</strong> D-0568 is holding the object and tries to insert it inside his mouth, unsuccessfully. The object's diameter is much too big for his jaw. Dr Baltin is dismissed for his inability to stay calm.<br/>\n<strong>T=3min48:</strong> D-0568 shows signs of confusion. He attempts to open his mouth wider, with the help of his hands, trying to match the object's measurements.<br/>\n<strong>T=4min12:</strong> D-0568 grasps his lower jaw with one hand and his upper jaw with the other one, showing signs of intense effort. Dr Laurent is dismissed for his inability to stay calm.<br/>\n<strong>T=5min06:</strong> D-0568 has managed to break his jaw. Subject seems to suffer at a normal level for a bone fracture with important lesions of facial tissues. SCP-024-FR does not seem to anesthetize the subject. Pain increases as he unsuccessfully tries to insert the object in the opening. Despite pain and blood loss, D-0568 appears to be determined. Dr Harlow is dismissed for his inability to cease asking for subject's termination.<br/>\n<strong>T=5min46:</strong> Subject dies as a result of his injuries following complete ablation of his lower jaw.

After incident #028/DE-I2 Site-DE3 was classified as SCP-028-DE and all stored SCPs were transferred to other facilities.</p>\n<p>SCP-028-DE consists of 106 rooms on 8 levels which are connected by hallways, staircases, and lifts. All rooms are marked with a rune of the elder futhark and sometimes a number, depending on their kind. The upper levels contain mostly rooms for personnel, training, and storage. The mid-levels contain laboratories, offices, and workshops, the lower levels contain cells and containment rooms. In the center of the facility, Room \u16a0 is located, a hall reaching over four levels. Both accesses are equipped with armored doors and in the second level above the room's ground is a control room with observation windows made from bullet-proof glass, which leads to the conclusion that Room \u16a0 was used as a containment room and/or experimental laboratory. However, the SKP has destroyed all records about the purpose of the room as well as the controls before the Foundation took over.</p>\n<p>Since incident #028-DE/I2 there is a portal (SCP-028-DE-C) in the middle of Room \u16a0, leading to universe U-3378-DE.

Right below a thin concrete floor of Room \u16be2, there was a steel hatch leading to a low chamber in the ceiling between both levels, which turned out to be a maintenance area for the device in question. Inside some old tools, spare parts and an uninscribed wiring plan were found. Though no drawing or documentation indicating the purpose of the device could be uncovered. The type label of the device had been removed. According to technical analysis, it was technically similar to a Scranton Reality Anchor but was designed to rather emit radiation than a stabilizing field, with, what was formerly assumed to be a cover, serving as an emitter. It was presumed to have been a safety device for the real purpose of Room \u16a0, and it was decided to test the device, to put it to use if applicable. Hereafter it is designated as SCP-028-DE-B.</p>\n<p><strong>Incident #028-DE/I2:</strong></p>\n<p>Despite its age, it was technically faultless and connected to a terminal, set up in the control room, which also controlled the other systems of the room. In accordance with safety-standards for reality-affecting machinery, all non-essential personnel was evacuated from the facility and all sectors were locked down. SRAs were very rare at that time and unavailable for the test. It is to be mentioned that all radio transmissions of the following protocol were digital and encrypted.</p>\n<p>The following is a transcript of an audio-/video protocol from the control room:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Present in the control room are Dr. Wilhelm Wiesmann (project manager), Dr. Frauke Meier (physicist), Dipl. Ing. Tobias Gretenkordt (electrical engineer), Lieutenant Cem Yilmaz (guard commander) and four armed guardsmen. Behind each armored door, two groups each of 12 men of the reaction forces are waiting, additional reaction- and security forces are on stand-by. MTF DE8-\ud835\udd0a (at that time without portable SRAs but already specialized for reality benders) is readied and on stand-by. The room is equipped with various measuring instruments; in lack of a Kant-Counter the reality-deviation can not be measured in Hume, but a laser grid detects distortions and diffraction of the room.</em></p>\n<p>&lt; START OF PROTOCOL &gt;</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Wiesmann:</strong> Recording. Alright, the security protocols are in effect, electrical supply and data link to our mysterious device are online, Room Fehu <em>(name of the rune \u16a0)</em> is empty. Gretenkordt, status?</p>\n<p><strong>Gretenkordt:</strong> All is ready. My finger hovers over the big red button.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Wiesmann:</strong> Well, press it then.</p>\n<p><em>Dipl. Ing. Gretenkordt activates the device.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Meier:</strong> I'm measuring a rise of long wave electromagnetic radiation. Nothing else. Or\u2026 wait, how shall I put it\u2026 it spreads over the frequency band. In other words, there is a slow increase in short wave radiation.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Wiesmann:</strong> Can you determine the source? <em>(The measuring points are arranged in a way that the source of any detected radiation can be triangulated.)</em><br/>\n<strong>Dr. Meier:</strong> Yes, definitely the dome in the ceiling. The radiation soon will reach visible light.<br/>\n<em>A few minutes later the dome seems to emit a deep red glow, which seems to wander slowly over bright red, yellow, etc. to cover the whole color spectrum until it exceeds the spectrum of visible light.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Meier:</strong> It seems to spread further. Now it has reached the spectrum of hard X-radiation. I just don't understand what for\u2026 Wait, it stopped. At \u2588\u2588\u2588 pm\u2026 Now it seems to degrade from the top, I mean from the longwave spectrum\u2026 as if it would focus on this wavelength.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Wiesmann:</strong> But wouldn't an emitter for electromagnetic radiation emit the correct wavelength right from the start? Why covering the whole spectrum? That's a waste of time.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Meier:</strong> Willi, we are talking about a Nazi-device here. Of all they did, they did nothing just because, especially not the SKP. There must be a reason. Maybe it was searching for a wavelength or frequency, and we just don't know by what criteria it chooses.</p>\n<p><em>The light turns green, then blue, purple and then goes out.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Gretenkordt:</strong> Who knows, maybe it is a satellite dish and now a portal opens, with Nazi-zombies on dinosaurs and\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Wiesmann:</strong> Fuck, abort!</p>\n<p><strong>Gretenkordt:</strong> What? Why\u2026</p>\n<p><em>Dr. Wiesmann pushes an emergency-shutdown-button, which disconnects SCP-028-DE-B from its electrical supply.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Wiesmann:</strong> <em>(Visibly shaken)</em> That <em>is</em> a satellite dish! It has been searching for a frequency to communicate! We\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Meier:</strong> Willi, we have a problem. The device is still running, and right now only emits radiation on this frequency.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Wiesmann:</strong> What?! Gretenkordt?</p>\n<p><strong>Gretenkordt:</strong> We didn't understand the first half of the device and the other half is unknown technology to us. Maybe this thing has a battery or so.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Wiesmann:</strong> Fucking Shit!</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Wiesmann via radio:</strong> Naudis 2, blow up the device, immediately!</p>\n<p><strong>Reaction force in Room \u16be2:</strong> Acknowledged, blowing up the device. <em>Short silence</em> Demolition not possible, the hatch cannot be opened.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Wiesmann via radio:</strong> Then think about a way, the\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Meier:</strong> The device now focusses on that frequency. I'm detecting a fluctuation in the middle of the room!</p>\n<p><strong>Gretenkordt:</strong> I'm restarting the device. Maybe a new search operation interrupts whatever is going on.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Wiesmann:</strong> Do that.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Wiesmann via site intercom:</strong> Wiesmann to all personnel, we may be facing a containment breach, prepare yourself!</p>\n<p><em>Now a spherical distortion is visible in the center of the room, which grows slowly.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Leutnant Yilmaz:</strong> Doctor, look!</p>\n<p><em>He points through the observation window to the distortion which has grown to a size of 3\u00a0m at this point, and through which the same room can be seen, just in another color.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Wiesmann:</strong> Gretenkordt, do something!</p>\n<p><strong>Gretenkordt:</strong> The device is powered again but doesn't reboot. It probably has to run through the whole cycle or until the juice is empty, or it has to be rebooted manually. I have no clue!</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Wiesmann:</strong> Then go to Naudis 2 and pull the plug or whatever.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Wiesmann via radio:</strong> Naudis 2, you are getting visited by an engineer. See to get the hatch open. No matter how!</p>\n<p><em>Dipl. Ing. Gretenkordt quickly leaves the control room.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Meier:</strong> Hm, the distortion decreases but the anomaly does not shrink. Willi, that thing is normalizing with its surroundings!</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Wiesmann:</strong> What does that mean?</p>\n<p><strong>Leutnant Yilmaz:</strong> You can look through it now, Doctor.</p>\n<p><em>The anomaly, SCP-028-DE-C, has taken the form of a sphere of \u00d815\u00a0m with its lower third is immersed into the floor. On the other side, the same room can be seen but painted in pale green instead of white, and the anomaly is surrounded by an apparatus (similar to the frame with the SRAs that is being built later). With cameras observing the anomaly from different angles, it can be seen that on the other side lots of people are gathering. Multiple groups of armed personnel in light grey uniforms and body armor are mustering. Some smaller groups are moving big crates to positions in the room.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Wiesmann:</strong> Holy shit\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Wiesmann via site intercom:</strong> Wiesmann to all personnel, containment breach imminent, attack individuals in grey uniforms on sight!</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Wiesmann via a secured channel to O4:</strong> Dr. Wiesmann from DE3 for O4, we are possibly facing an invasion from another reality! Requesting deployment of MTFs!</p>\n<p><strong>O4-\u2588:</strong> O4 to Dr. Wiesmann, what sort of invasion are we talking about?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Wiesmann to O4:</strong> Probably a universe full of Nazis.</p>\n<p><strong>O4-\u2588:</strong> <em>Short break</em> Reinforcements are on their way. Hold them off as long as you can. O4 out.</p>\n<p><em>O4-\u2588 dispatches MTF DE8-\ud835\udd0a (arrival via helicopter after ca. 15 minutes), MTF DE8-\ud835\udd05, armored MTF DE8-\u212d (both arrival after ca. 80 minutes) as well as the always-ready MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e (arrival after ca. 25 minutes)</em></p>\n<p>&lt; END OF PROTOCOL &gt;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While the MTFs are underway, the Reaction- and Security-forces of the site erect barricades and firing positions in front of the accesses to room \u16a0 and in the main corridors. Remaining personnel that is not required is evacuated from the facility. The tank battalion PzBtl 64, the closest unit of the Bundeswehr, is brought to readiness with a fake emergency drill.</p>\n<p>The following is a transcript of the events after the arrival of MTF DE8-\ud835\udd0a (\"8-Gustav\"):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&lt; START OF PROTOCOL &gt;</p>\n<p><em>MTF DE8-\ud835\udd0a has 20 members and is under command by Captain Martin Franz. It can be separated into three squads: Two combat squads of 8 individuals under command of Captain Franz and Lieutenant Nowak, as well as a technical-scientific squad of 4 under command of Doctor Schmieder.</em></p>\n<p><em>The likewise dispatched MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e (\"4-Karl\") is to arrive about 10 minutes later and consists of 14 individuals under command of Captain R\u00fcberg. All members of the MTF have passed a memetic-resistance-training class \u03a8-3 and are trained for commando operations.</em></p>\n<p><em>MTF DE8-\ud835\udd0a arrives at Site-DE3 via helicopter 14 minutes after their dispatchment and proceed to the control room of Room \u16a0, in which Captain Franz, Lieutenant Nowak, and the TS-squad then are discussing with the team of Dr. Wiesmann.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Cpt. Franz:</strong> Doctor Wiesmann? Captain Franz from 8-Gustav. These are Lieutenant Nowak and the technical-scientific squad of Doctor Schmieder. Please outline the situation briefly but precisely. I will put the radio of 4-Karl, who are going to be here in a few minutes, on hands-free communication.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Wiesmann:</strong> Good to have you here. So, you see the dome in the room's ceiling? <em>Points at the dome through the reinforced window.</em> Therein is a device of the SKP, a former Nazi-institution for anomalies, which technically is similar to a Scranton Reality Anchor and which we wanted to test. Normally it can be accessed from a room above, but the hatch is locked wherefore we could not blow it up. Our technicians have connected it to these controls and started it. There is nearly no original documentation, we reverse-engineered it as far as possible. When we started it, it began searching the whole electromagnetic spectrum, beginning with long waves and focused on a frequency of hard X-radiation, then a distortion appeared and grew to the portal you see there, which has kept its size. I presumed an imminent invasion and requested O4 to deploy you. One of my engineers is on the way to the device to restart it manually, hoping the search interrupts the portal, while a squad tries to open the hatch, yet unsuccessfully though.</p>\n<p><em>Visible through SCP-028-DE-C, multiple armed squads of circa 120 men in total have mustered. In front of them, a person in a uniform that looks like an officer's uniform of the Wehrmacht seems to be holding a speech.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Schmieder:</strong> As far as I know you neither are having a reality-expert nor someone familiar with the design of Reality Anchors? I will go to this room with the TS-Squad. I have memorized the floorplan of your facility, we will find the way by ourselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Cpt. Franz:</strong> You do that. <em>To Dr. Wiesmann</em> We will take a position in the meantime. O4 has dispatched additional MTFs and considering the enemy's assumed amount and strength, we need everyone who can hold a gun. You will stay here.</p>\n<p><strong>Cpt. Franz via site intercom:</strong> Captain Franz of 8-Gustav here, to all Reaction- and Security-forces: Set your radio to encrypted channel 54. Should you encounter persons in light grey uniforms, you open fire immediately. But take care of yourself, use cover and change your position.</p>\n<p><strong>Cpt. R\u00fcberg via radio:</strong> 4-Karl to 8-Gustav, we're arriving. Let us meet in the lobby to make a plan.</p>\n<p><strong>Cpt. Franz via radio:</strong> Good, let's meet there. As far as I can see we are running out of time, so make it on the double.</p>\n<p><em>The MTFs are meeting with Hauptmann Armbruster, the commander of site-security, in the lobby.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Cpt. Franz:</strong> So, we do not have time, so we make it short. Hauptmann Armbruster, Captain R\u00fcberg, according to Deployment Policy 28-and-so-forth I am taking operation command. All know the site's floor plans and have read the briefing? <em>Short break.</em> Good. The site's Reaction-Forces have secured both entrances of Room Fehu. The armored doors are closed and locked. In the main corridors, barricades and firing positions have been set up. Site-Security is patrolling through the whole facility, in case a secondary portal is opened somewhere, like in incident 1. Two other MTFs are on their way from DE8 by convoy. They are arriving approximately in an hour. One is a heavy infantry platoon of a hundred, the other is an armored unit. If I remember correctly they have some of the new Tactical Power Armors. There is no specific mission plan, as we are unprepared for this threat, so we will improvise. Our mission here is to stop the imminent threat of an invasion, to avert it and to close the portal. Loss of the facility, personnel, and equipment is acceptable. For the first task, 8-Gustav will reinforce the Reaction-Forces at the armored doors. Our Technical-Scientific Squad is working on the last task in Naudis 2. Both 8ers in transfer are responsible to push back possible invaders. 4-Karl, what will you do?</p>\n<p><strong>Cpt. R\u00fcberg:</strong> We probably would be of use at the armored doors, but we as a commando unit are better suited for counter-invasion. We will stay at the junction of the corridor, leading to both doors. The priority now is to hold up the status quo until the other MTFs arrive. Should the attackers open one door or should they attempt to open both doors, you start a counter-attack from one direction. Divert their attention to you while we are coming from the other side, trying to cross the portal and to destroy whatever technology they are having there. We are carrying explosives with us. Should we be locked in the other world, set up a memorial for us or so.</p>\n<p><strong>Cpt. Franz:</strong> Good plan, let's make it so. Everyone to their position! Lieutenant Nowak, you take Squad 2 and go to the right.</p>\n<p><strong>Cpt. Franz via radio:</strong> Franz to Doctor Schmieder, status?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Schmieder via radio:</strong> Schmieder to Franz, we are in Naudis 2, the hatch here appears to be held shut by magnetic locks. The security squad which has been here already is burning a hole in it for half an hour now with a plasma cutter, which proves difficult due to the hatch's concrete filling. I advise against the destruction of the device from below, without having seen it before.</p>\n<p><strong>Cpt. Franz via radio:</strong> Understood, continue!</p>\n<p><em>While the squads are taking positions, and Captain Franz is instructing the MTFs in transfer via radio, the first foreign units cross the portal. The officer, who has been holding a speech before, follows the units. He is taking a mobile phone from his pocket and types in a number. The phone in the control room rings. After a pause, Dr. Wiesmann answers.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Wiesmann:</strong> Doctor Wiesmann, Site-DE3?</p>\n<p><strong>Caller:</strong> Good day doctor, this is Major Armbruster of the Waffen-SKP. I know it may not look like it, but actually, we are here for peaceful purposes. Of course, you are having units posted behind the entrances, and probably you have alarmed everybody who can carry a weapon. But before we begin with hostilities, I want to negotiate with you, the site director or someone else who is in charge.</p>\n<p><em>This Major Armbruster seems to look very similar to Hauptmann Armbruster from Site-DE3's security. Lieutenant Yilmaz is holding up a hastily inscribed note: <tt>\u201cPlay for time!\u201d</tt></em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Wiesmann:</strong> I uh\u2026 I am afraid I am not the right person, I\u2026 have to talk to O4\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Maj. Armbruster:</strong> I am sure you have to. Alone to give your advancing forces some time. Just take all the time you want but do not forget this: You caught us by surprise. This here is the forces we could gather in this short time. But as we talk here, the tank battalion 64 of the Wehrmacht is securing the outer perimeter and several Mobile Einsatzkr\u00e4fte from Sondereinrichtung-4 and -8 are on their way.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Wiesmann via a secure channel to O4:</strong> Wiesmann to O4, they\u2026 are in. Their commander wants to talk to you\u2026</p>\n<p><em>Short break</em></p>\n<p><strong>O4-1:</strong> O4-1 here, put me through.</p>\n<p><em>Doctor Meier patches the call from the phone to the radio unit.</em></p>\n<p>[SECURITY CLEARANCE LEVEL 3 CONFIRMED, ACCESS GRANTED]</p>\n<p><strong>O4-1:</strong> This is O4-1.</p>\n<p><strong>Maj. Armbruster:</strong> O4-1, good day. I am Major Armbruster of the Waffen-SKP. I am not used to your terminology, as you have given us false information during our last contact. Would you be so kind as to describe your position to me?</p>\n<p><strong>O4-1:</strong> I am the chairman of the Directors' Council of the germanophone branch of the SCP Foundation. You are invaders in our universe, it's too late for cordialities!</p>\n<p><strong>Maj. Armbruster:</strong> I understand. Is it possible to talk to a higher instance, or is each of your local Foundations autonomous?</p>\n<p><strong>O4-1:</strong> You are talking only to me.</p>\n<p><strong>Maj. Armbruster:</strong> Okay then. Well, as you may imagine, we are not here for research, trade or establishment of diplomatic relations. Yes, we will conquer you, that is beyond all question. We are much more technically advanced than you are. But we are no murderers. We do not want war. If you surrender now and hand us over your facility as a base of operations without resistance, lots of bloodshed can be avoided. I am aware that this decision is not an easy one, but I ask you to see the situation pragmatically. You have opened this portal; our invasion is unavoidable. Resistance only leads to suffering and death. I give you 15 minutes to decide.</p>\n<p><em>Major Armbruster hangs up and gives orders to his units. They begin erecting mobile barricades and firing positions. The MTFs are still 30 minutes away.</em></p>\n<p><strong>O4-1 via radio:</strong> O4-1 to all forces in Site-DE3. You now are facing the probably most important task of your life: To avert a DK-class invasion-scenario. You are our first, and probably last bastion against a superior enemy. Withstand until reinforcements arrive and fight the enemy back with them! The O4-Council and I are putting all our hope in you.</p>\n<p>&lt; END OF PROTOCOL &gt;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>O4-1 informs O5. In an expedited procedure under the consultation of the Ethics Committee, they release an early version of protocol \u201cRagnar\u00f6k\u201d as a last resort. O5 commences preparations and instructs O4 to put all close sites under lockdown and to mobilize their MTFs. The team of Dr. Schmieder in Room \u16be2 has been able to open the hatch in the meantime, and the team as well as Dipl. Ing. Gretenkordt is examining SCP-028-DE-B, which seems to be in some sort of standby mode and does not emit radiation.</p>\n<p>The following are the events after the expiration of Major Armbruster's ultimatum:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&lt; START OF PROTOCOL &gt;</p>\n<p><em>Major Armbruster is giving orders, whereupon two teams start applying a mass that seems similar to modeling-clay to the armored doors in the form of a rectangle.

Yilmaz via radio:</strong> Lieutenant Yilmaz to 8-Gustav, looks like they are preparing to breach at both armored doors.</p>\n<p><strong>Cpt. Franz via radio:</strong> Understood. We are opening the left door. 4-Karl, you go to the right! On my mark, Squad 2 charges into the room, You follow, flank them and go through the portal. All forces, prepare yourself! Reinforcements in circa 13 minutes.</p>\n<p><em>The Reaction Forces are taking position as the left armored door is opening slowly. The troops of the SKP are behind cover.

In opposition to yours, our world is at peace since the end of the war in the 50th. No local conflicts which are escalated into regional civil wars by superpowers. No capitalism, no communism. Health, welfare and educational systems that do not only exist by name but are really social. No unemployment. No epidemics. Just peace and wealth for everyone.

A portal-generator?</p>\n<p><strong>MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e/4:</strong> Well, I guess there is only one way to find out\u2026</p>\n<p><em>MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e/4, the engineer of the team, pulls a cordless screwdriver from his backpack, removes the screws from one of the devices, rips the cables out and throws it through the portal.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Wiesmann (U-3378-DE) via site intercom:</strong> Is that how you behave as guests?</p>\n<p><em>MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e/4 is making a rude gesture towards the control room.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Cpt. R\u00fcberg:</strong> Fuck it, place the charges. The rest provides cover.</p>\n<p><em>MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e/7, the demolition expert of the team, and MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e/8 begin to plant charges in different locations of the framework, and to connect them to a wireless detonator. Meanwhile, an armored door opens - significantly faster than those in Site-DE3 - and a group of armed men charges into the room. Both groups are immediately opening fire upon each other. Thanks to their elite training, MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e can quickly eliminate the defenders, though not without suffering casualties, among them demolition expert MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e/7. Cpt. R\u00fcberg leaves the detonator near the framework, so possible advancing own troops do not have to search for it and proceed through the open armored door deeper into the facility. They encounter only low resistance, the invaders under the command of Major Armbruster seem to be the Reaction Forces of the site, while remaining and inferior equipped forces seem to be normal security personnel. They quickly reach the control room which is secured by a code lock; the code is the same as in the known reality though. Without hesitating, MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e terminates the guards, Dr. Wiesmann, Dr. Meier, Dipl. Ing. Gretenkordt as well as Lt. Yilmaz who in opposition to the other forces does not wear a light grey but a sand-colored uniform with insignia that appear to be of the Ottoman Empire.</em></p>\n<p><strong>MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e/2:</strong> Dude, how crazy is it that they have the same people here? Do you think we will meet ourselves here?</p>\n<p><strong>Cpt. R\u00fcberg:</strong> I would rather not. Do the controls tell you anything?</p>\n<p><strong>MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e/2:</strong> No, the fuckers have locked the controls before we shot them. No time to search for passwords.</p>\n<p><strong>Cpt. R\u00fcberg:</strong> Plant a charge and then we proceed to Naudis 2.</p>\n<p><em>MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e/8 plants the charge on the controls and connects it with a second detonator.

R\u00fcberg:</strong> And off we go! Back to room Fehu. Then we blow their shit up!</p>\n<p><em>On the way back, MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e runs into a large group of soldiers, seemingly a part of the reinforcements.

MTF DE8-\ud835\udd05 is a heavy infantry unit of around 100 men with body armor and squads with ballistic shields. MTF DE8-\u212d is an armored unit with three armored vehicles with autocannons, a truck with a 105\u00a0mm cannon hidden on its load bed, as well as a squad equipped with the newly introduced Tactical Power Armor, it's supply squad and supporting heavy infantry.</p>\n<p>The following is a transcript of the recordings from room \u16be2, in which the technical-scientific squad of MTF DE8-\ud835\udd0a is working, at the time the ultimatum of Major Armbruster is running out (15 minutes before the reinforcements arrive):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&lt; START OF PROTOCOL &gt;</p>\n<p><em>In room \u16be2, there are the technical-scientific squad of MTF DE8-\ud835\udd0a led by Dr. Schmieder, Dipl. Ing. Gretenkordt and a team of guards of Site-DE3. The squad has opened the hatch in the floor and Dr. Schmieder, Dipl. Ing. Gretenkordt as well as two other members of the technical-scientific squad have entered the low room and are examining SCP-028-DE-B.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Gretenkordt:</strong> So, do you have a clue what that thing is, Doctor Reality?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Schmieder:</strong> How dare you!</p>\n<p><strong>Gretenkordt:</strong> Sorry. Doctor Schmieder.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Schmieder:</strong> Better\u2026 To answer your question, yes, I have. Your original assumption that this is some sort of early Scranton Reality Anchor is correct in general, but to be more precise it is only working like an SRA. To make it short, there is a measure for reality, the Hume. The reality usually is around 20 Hm. The more hume, the more stable the reality. The abilities of reality benders are usually based on changing the measure of reality in themselves or their surroundings, and to change the reality according to their will. SRAs are machines that add or remove reality from dead or empty universes, to create fields of stable reality, usually at about 20 Hm. This device here is working similarly, but it also is an interareal transmitter. The dome seems to be the cover of a parabolic dish, with which the device is focussing its effect on one point.</p>\n<p><em>Noise of battle can be heard from Room \u16a0.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Gretenkordt:</strong> Ok, but do you have an idea if we can use it?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Schmieder:</strong> That depends on whether my assumption about how it works is correct. I assume that it starts with a search for the right frequency, which is why it has covered the whole electromagnetic spectrum. To be able to send intrareal, it probably has created a minimally small zone of extremely low reality in a defined point, through which the radiation can leave our universe and enter another universe with a similar zone of extremely low reality within reach, to establish communication. I assume it was originally built to send aimlessly into the \u201cintrareal space\u201d, as like we are sending messages aimlessly into space to see if someone answers. In the universe now standing wide open down there, they probably have built the same device which has still been in operation. They must have known that we exist and maybe just have waited for us to send. Then they have sent a signal back and this device has enlarged the zone of low reality in synchronization with theirs. They must have another apparatus there to stabilize the low-reality zone into a portal.</p>\n<p><strong>Gretenkordt:</strong> Do you think this device can raise the reality instead of lowering it?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Schmieder:</strong> Yes I do, and I think that is our only chance to end this. And as this old device does not have digital controls, it should be enough to rewire it a bit.</p>\n<p><em>It takes approximately 20 minutes to make the modifications. The reinforcements have arrived on both sides and are engaged in a fierce battle. The SKP is using it's Tactical Power Armor to secure Room \u16a0 while those of the Foundation and the troops in front of them with ballistic shields are forming moveable barricades in the corridors and are supporting the troops with their heavy weapons. Thanks to the nano-coated armor of the Tactical Power Armor, they are extremely well protected against fire from most weapons.</em></p>\n<p><em>As the troops of the SKP are pushed back to Room \u16a0, a firefight between the Power Armored squads of both sides breaks loose, which seems to be coequal, though the battle involves heavy losses among the infantry. From SCP-028-DE-C, more troops of the SKP push through while troops of the Foundation are advancing from the corridors. More MTFs and Reaction Forces from close facilities are on their way to Site-DE3. The early version of protocol \u201cRagnar\u00f6k\u201d is ready for execution.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Schmieder via radio:</strong> This is Doctor Schmieder of MTF DE8-Gustav to mission control; come in, please!</p>\n<p><strong>Mission control via radio:</strong> This is Major Peters, mission control. You are the reality expert, right?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Schmieder via radio:</strong> Correct, Major, I think we have a chance to destabilize the portal, but there must be a machine or device on the other side, holding the portal open. Let your troops search and destroy it!</p>\n<p><strong>Mission control via radio:</strong> There is something, indeed. Some sort of framework around the portal. Is that what you mean?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Schmieder via radio:</strong> That is hard to say without having seen it, but in absence of options I have to say yes. Have it destroyed.</p>\n<p><em>From the transmission of MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e it is known that there have been charges planted on the framework and that the detonator may still be laying there. The Tactical Power Armor squad is ordered to recover the detonator, to detonate the charges without detonator or to destroy the devices with their heavy weapons.</em></p>\n<p><em>The Tactical Power Armor squad manages to advance through the portal, followed by the Power Armors of the SKP. The detonator is nowhere to be found, and the charges have been removed, though they are still in a crate in the room. The troops of the Foundation can move the crate with the charges to the middle of the room and detonate it with direct fire.</em></p>\n<p><em>The machinery around SCP-028-DE-C is damaged and breaks down. However, the portal does not collapse but it \u201cbursts\u201d and suddenly expands to a diameter of ca. \u00d850\u00a0m. It does not seem to have a defined \u201chull\u201d and appears to taper off gradually. Within the affected zone, the reality seems to be undefined. Personnel reports, that both realities are perceived alternating and that the perception can change after blinking or a fast turn. All personnel in the affected zone seem to exist in both universes at the same time and are visible on all cameras (some live-feeds from cameras of the SKP can be recorded now due to overlapping cables). In opposition, inanimate objects apparently stay in \u201ctheir\u201d universes. Electromagnetic signals appear to exist in both realities.</em></p>\n<p><em>Guards of the SKP appear in Room \u16be2 and are overpowered. Everywhere in the corridors personnel of the SKP appears, and heavy fights break loose.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Schmieder:</strong> <em>Is visibly startled.</em> What the hell\u2026 where does that control board come from?</p>\n<p><em>Dr. Schmieder\u2019s shoulder camera is in the normal universe and no control board is visible.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Gretenkordt:</strong> What control board?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Schmieder:</strong> Wait, you do not see a control board there?</p>\n<p><strong>Gretenkordt:</strong> No!? Doctor, what is going on? And where did those guys come from?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Schmieder:</strong> You are asking questions\u2026 if I interpret the boom-sound correctly, the MTFs have blown something up and I would assume it was the portal stabilizing device. I do not know how it works, but I think we are inside the portal. Without the stabilization, both universes seem to exist coincidentally. We are now threatened by a Universe-conjunction, multiple universes merging to one, and therewith a permanent transition, or a hole that devours both universes. Both are to be prevented, so I suggest we start the device here and hope it reestablishes reality.</p>\n<p><em>Dr. Schmieder is starting up SCP-028-DE-B.

When the boundary of the anomaly is approaching you, blink before it reaches you until you see the desired reality. Keep your eyes open as long as possible and avoid all movement. The boundary of the anomaly is fluxionary; you will not notice when you are through.

According to analyses the device which was removed from the framework around SCP-028-DE-C and had been thrown through it by MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e, belongs to a cluster of emitters similar to Scranton Reality Buoys, that generate a spherical field to stabilize SCP-028-DE-C.

Many anomalous objects in containment by the Foundation also exist in U-3378-DE, however often are often contained under different circumstances like <a href=\"http://scp-int.wikidot.com/skp-173-us\">SKP-173-US</a>, or have been destroyed, should the SKP have found them too dangerous or without use for them.</p>\n<p>Recently recovered data revealed that <a href=\"http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-188-de\">SCP-188-DE</a>, which was developed by the SKP in our universe, was handed to them through SCP-028-DE-C in 1945, shortly before they surrendered to the US Army.

Personnel stationed here may use the wellness-areas for relaxation, which are operated by level 1 personnel. Should civilians try to book a room, they are to be put off with alleged overbooking. The associated grounds are fenced-in and under video surveillance, and there are 2 guard squads on patrol at all times. The driveways are under access control.\n\n\n\nThe subterranean sectors of SCP-028-DE are fully under video surveillance and are permanently patrolled by 12 guard squads of no less than 8 men, armed with an arsenal reaching from normal assault rifles and flame throwers up to laser-projectors. For a full list of equipment see #028-DE/A3\n\n\n\nThere are 18 Scranton Reality Anchors on the surface, with various disguises and guarded and under surveillance at all time, in a vertical distance of exactly 747.9 m (seven-hundred forty-seven point nine) from a fixed metering point on the perimeter, and an even distance to each other, correct to a decimeter. These SRAs are to be permanently in operation and calibrated to 20 Hm \u00b1 0.1 Hm.\n\n\n\nAround SCP-028-DE-C in Room \u16a0 is a spherical framework with a diameter of 18 m, holding 36 SRAs in as even distances as possible. On one side the SRAs and the frame are pivoting, to allow access for the equipment from #028-DE/P1.\n\n\n\nShould reality-deviation of more than 2 Hm be detected on one or more Anchors, all off-duty personnel are to be put into standby, the site's Reaction-Forces have to take up their stations and O4[[footnote]]Unofficial designation of the directors' council of the German branch.[[/footnote]] is to be informed. If the deviation reaches 6 Hm, O5 is to be informed and codeword ``Heimdall'' is to be sent to Site-DE20 with top priority and with normal priority to the facilities on list #028-DE/A1. The Reaction-Forces start preparing protocol ``Mj\u00f6lnir''. Individuals from U-3378-DE (SCP-028-DE-A) that may manifest as of a deviation of 11 Hm are to be neutralized by //all// available means.\n\n\n\nShould SCP-028-DE-C open, the protocol ``Mj\u00f6lnir'' is to be executed. Should protocol ``Mj\u00f6lnir'' be unsuccessful or should the deviation reach 18 Hm, Site-DE20 is ordered by O4 or O5 to execute protocol ``Ragnar\u00f6k''.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-028-DE is Site-DE3. Site-DE3 is the former headquarter and secret research facility of the former [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/skp-portal Sonderkommando f\u00fcr Paranormales][[footnote]]The SKP was a secret organization under the direction of Heinrich Himmler, which had arisen from the Hexen-Sonderauftrag of the SS, focused on the weaponization of anomalies. After the Second World War, the SKP was - at least in our universe - disbanded, their anomalies were transferred to the Foundation and their personnel was, as far as trustworthy, integrated into the SCP-Foundation stationed in Germany and Austria, or terminated.[[/footnote]], and until the first appearance of SCP-028-DE-A during #028-DE/I1, was mainly used to research the SKP's work and for storage of SCPs not requiring complex Containment Procedures and care. After incident #028/DE-I2 Site-DE3 was classified as SCP-028-DE and all stored SCPs were transferred to other facilities.\n\n\n\nSCP-028-DE consists of 106 rooms on 8 levels which are connected by hallways, staircases, and lifts. All rooms are marked with a rune of the elder futhark and sometimes a number, depending on their kind. The upper levels contain mostly rooms for personnel, training, and storage. The mid-levels contain laboratories, offices, and workshops, the lower levels contain cells and containment rooms. In the center of the facility, Room \u16a0 is located, a hall reaching over four levels. Both accesses are equipped with armored doors and in the second level above the room's ground is a control room with observation windows made from bullet-proof glass, which leads to the conclusion that Room \u16a0 was used as a containment room and/or experimental laboratory. However, the SKP has destroyed all records about the purpose of the room as well as the controls before the Foundation took over.\n\n\n\nSince incident #028-DE/I2 there is a portal (SCP-028-DE-C) in the middle of Room \u16a0, leading to universe U-3378-DE. The portal is currently closed by the SRAs around SCP-028-DE.\n\n\n\n**Appendices:**\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show incident-protocol #028-DE/I1\" hide=\"- Hide incident-protocol\"]]\n\n\n\n> //On the 199\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588 at 02:47 in the morning - SCP-028-DE then was designated just as Site-DE3 and was not fully under video surveillance - the terminal of Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 turned itself off after false passwords were entered repeatedly while trying to access documents of clearance level 4, and triggered an alarm.//\n\n>\n\n> //As nobody worked on night-shifts despite the guards, and nightly access to the lower levels was only possible with an exception permit, a silent intruder alert was triggered according to alarm-protocol. The Reaction-Forces of the facility were sent to Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's office and the terminal was set to a virtual access mode, to feign access to the database to keep the intruder occupied.//\n\n> \n\n> //The Reaction-Team stormed Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's office and found a person who looked like Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 but wore a light gray uniform with the logo of the SKP, and was busy with Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's terminal.//\n\n> \n\n> //The person, hereafter designated SCP-028-DE-A-1, immediately opened fire with a weapon that is assumed to have been a fully automatic railgun, whose projectiles penetrated through the body armor and even through the walls of twenty centimeters thick reinforced concrete.//\n\n> \n\n> //A nonfatally wounded member of the Reaction-Team reported that a few minutes after the gunfight, in which the site director locked down the lower levels and called for an MTF, she removed a floppy-disk from the terminal which was connected to some sort of tablet computer// [[footnote]]The Guardsman described it as ``//a flat thing the size of ISO A5 paper she tapped on//''; tablet-computers did not exist in our universe yet at that time.[[/footnote]] //via cable. Moments later the air started shimmering in an area before her, warped and some sort of portal opened. She entered the portal which closed behind her.//\n\n\n\nThe surviving guardsman noted that he could see the same room through the portal, which was painted in another color, and the furniture was designed in some sort of futuristic Bauhaus style.\n\n\n\nIt is presumed that due to the then inactive nature of SCP-028-DE-B it was impossible to open larger portals, which would have allowed a larger infiltration of the facility.\n\n\n\nAnalysis of the terminal's protocols resulted that the SCP-Directory, information about facilities, personnel, security-protocols and especially SCPs that were taken over from the SKP and their positions had been downloaded. These SCPs were immediately relocated and the security of the respective sites was raised.\n\n\n\nAs Scranton Reality Anchors were unavailable at that time, surveillance cameras were installed in all hallways and the guards were stocked up, all SCPs were transferred to other facilities, access to the Foundation's database was strongly limited and only the SKP's work was researched. Already then it was considered to declare the facility an SCP, but it was not deemed necessary.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Open Incident #028-DE/I2 \" hide=\"- Access granted\"]]\n\n**Preamble:**\n\nLocated in the ceiling of Room \u16a0 was a down curved cover with a diameter of circa 2 m, which could not be removed from inside the room, and left the impression of being part of a larger device inside the ceiling. In the week before the 200\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588, the site director ordered that the floor of Room \u16be2, which is located directly above Room \u16a0, was to be opened to access the device assumed to be inside the ceiling. Right below a thin concrete floor of Room \u16be2, there was a steel hatch leading to a low chamber in the ceiling between both levels, which turned out to be a maintenance area for the device in question. Inside some old tools, spare parts and an uninscribed wiring plan were found. Though no drawing or documentation indicating the purpose of the device could be uncovered. The type label of the device had been removed. According to technical analysis, it was technically similar to a Scranton Reality Anchor but was designed to rather emit radiation than a stabilizing field, with, what was formerly assumed to be a cover, serving as an emitter. It was presumed to have been a safety device for the real purpose of Room \u16a0, and it was decided to test the device, to put it to use if applicable. Hereafter it is designated as SCP-028-DE-B.\n\n\n\n**Incident #028-DE/I2:**\n\n\n\nDespite its age, it was technically faultless and connected to a terminal, set up in the control room, which also controlled the other systems of the room. In accordance with safety-standards for reality-affecting machinery, all non-essential personnel was evacuated from the facility and all sectors were locked down. SRAs were very rare at that time and unavailable for the test. It is to be mentioned that all radio transmissions of the following protocol were digital and encrypted.\n\n\n\nThe following is a transcript of an audio-/video protocol from the control room:\n\n\n\n> //Present in the control room are Dr. Wilhelm Wiesmann (project manager), Dr. Frauke Meier (physicist), Dipl. Ing. Tobias Gretenkordt (electrical engineer), Lieutenant Cem Yilmaz (guard commander) and four armed guardsmen. Behind each armored door, two groups each of 12 men of the reaction forces are waiting, additional reaction- and security forces are on stand-by. MTF DE8-\ud835\udd0a (at that time without portable SRAs but already specialized for reality benders) is readied and on stand-by. The room is equipped with various measuring instruments; in lack of a Kant-Counter the reality-deviation can not be measured in Hume, but a laser grid detects distortions and diffraction of the room.//\n\n> \n\n> < START OF PROTOCOL >\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Wiesmann:** Recording. Alright, the security protocols are in effect, electrical supply and data link to our mysterious device are online, Room Fehu //(name of the rune \u16a0)// is empty. Gretenkordt, status?\n\n> \n\n> **Gretenkordt:** All is ready. My finger hovers over the big red button.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Wiesmann:** Well, press it then.\n\n> \n\n> //Dipl. Ing. Gretenkordt activates the device.//\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Meier:** I'm measuring a rise of long wave electromagnetic radiation. Nothing else. Or... wait, how shall I put it... it spreads over the frequency band. In other words, there is a slow increase in short wave radiation.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Wiesmann:** Can you determine the source? //(The measuring points are arranged in a way that the source of any detected radiation can be triangulated.)//\n\n>\n\n> **Dr. Meier:** Yes, definitely the dome in the ceiling. The radiation soon will reach visible light.\n\n>\n\n> //A few minutes later the dome seems to emit a deep red glow, which seems to wander slowly over bright red, yellow, etc. to cover the whole color spectrum until it exceeds the spectrum of visible light.//\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Meier:** It seems to spread further. Now it has reached the spectrum of hard X-radiation. I just don't understand what for... Wait, it stopped. At \u2588\u2588\u2588 pm... Now it seems to degrade from the top, I mean from the longwave spectrum... as if it would focus on this wavelength.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Wiesmann:** But wouldn't an emitter for electromagnetic radiation emit the correct wavelength right from the start? Why covering the whole spectrum? That's a waste of time.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Meier:** Willi, we are talking about a Nazi-device here. Of all they did, they did nothing just because, especially not the SKP. There must be a reason. Maybe it was searching for a wavelength or frequency, and we just don't know by what criteria it chooses.\n\n> \n\n> //The light turns green, then blue, purple and then goes out.//\n\n> \n\n> **Gretenkordt:** Who knows, maybe it is a satellite dish and now a portal opens, with Nazi-zombies on dinosaurs and...\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Wiesmann:** Fuck, abort!\n\n> \n\n> **Gretenkordt:** What? Why...\n\n> \n\n> //Dr. Wiesmann pushes an emergency-shutdown-button, which disconnects SCP-028-DE-B from its electrical supply.//\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Wiesmann:** //(Visibly shaken)// That //is// a satellite dish! It has been searching for a frequency to communicate! We...\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Meier:** Willi, we have a problem. The device is still running, and right now only emits radiation on this frequency.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Wiesmann:** What?! Gretenkordt?\n\n> \n\n> **Gretenkordt:** We didn't understand the first half of the device and the other half is unknown technology to us. Maybe this thing has a battery or so.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Wiesmann:** Fucking Shit!\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Wiesmann via radio:** Naudis 2, blow up the device, immediately!\n\n> \n\n> **Reaction force in Room \u16be2:** Acknowledged, blowing up the device. //Short silence// Demolition not possible, the hatch cannot be opened.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Wiesmann via radio:** Then think about a way, the...\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Meier:** The device now focusses on that frequency. I'm detecting a fluctuation in the middle of the room!\n\n> \n\n> **Gretenkordt:** I'm restarting the device. Maybe a new search operation interrupts whatever is going on.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Wiesmann:** Do that.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Wiesmann via site intercom:** Wiesmann to all personnel, we may be facing a containment breach, prepare yourself!\n\n> \n\n> //Now a spherical distortion is visible in the center of the room, which grows slowly.//\n\n> \n\n> **Leutnant Yilmaz:** Doctor, look!\n\n> \n\n> //He points through the observation window to the distortion which has grown to a size of 3 m at this point, and through which the same room can be seen, just in another color.//\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Wiesmann:** Gretenkordt, do something!\n\n> \n\n> **Gretenkordt:** The device is powered again but doesn't reboot. It probably has to run through the whole cycle or until the juice is empty, or it has to be rebooted manually. I have no clue!\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Wiesmann:** Then go to Naudis 2 and pull the plug or whatever.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Wiesmann via radio:** Naudis 2, you are getting visited by an engineer. See to get the hatch open. No matter how!\n\n> \n\n> //Dipl. Ing. Gretenkordt quickly leaves the control room.//\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Meier:** Hm, the distortion decreases but the anomaly does not shrink. Willi, that thing is normalizing with its surroundings!\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Wiesmann:** What does that mean?\n\n> \n\n> **Leutnant Yilmaz:** You can look through it now, Doctor.\n\n> \n\n> //The anomaly, SCP-028-DE-C, has taken the form of a sphere of \u00d815 m with its lower third is immersed into the floor. On the other side, the same room can be seen but painted in pale green instead of white, and the anomaly is surrounded by an apparatus (similar to the frame with the SRAs that is being built later). With cameras observing the anomaly from different angles, it can be seen that on the other side lots of people are gathering. Multiple groups of armed personnel in light grey uniforms and body armor are mustering. Some smaller groups are moving big crates to positions in the room.//\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Wiesmann:** Holy shit...\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Wiesmann via site intercom:** Wiesmann to all personnel, containment breach imminent, attack individuals in grey uniforms on sight!\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Wiesmann via a secured channel to O4:** Dr. Wiesmann from DE3 for O4, we are possibly facing an invasion from another reality! Requesting deployment of MTFs!\n\n> \n\n> **O4-\u2588:** O4 to Dr. Wiesmann, what sort of invasion are we talking about?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Wiesmann to O4:** Probably a universe full of Nazis.\n\n> \n\n> **O4-\u2588:** //Short break// Reinforcements are on their way. Hold them off as long as you can. O4 out.\n\n> \n\n> //O4-\u2588 dispatches MTF DE8-\ud835\udd0a (arrival via helicopter after ca. 15 minutes), MTF DE8-\ud835\udd05, armored MTF DE8-\u212d (both arrival after ca. 80 minutes) as well as the always-ready MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e (arrival after ca. 25 minutes)//\n\n> \n\n> < END OF PROTOCOL >\n\n\n\nWhile the MTFs are underway, the Reaction- and Security-forces of the site erect barricades and firing positions in front of the accesses to room \u16a0 and in the main corridors. Remaining personnel that is not required is evacuated from the facility. The tank battalion PzBtl 64, the closest unit of the Bundeswehr, is brought to readiness with a fake emergency drill.\n\n\n\nThe following is a transcript of the events after the arrival of MTF DE8-\ud835\udd0a (\"8-Gustav\"):\n\n\n\n> < START OF PROTOCOL >\n\n> \n\n> //MTF DE8-\ud835\udd0a has 20 members and is under command by Captain Martin Franz. It can be separated into three squads: Two combat squads of 8 individuals under command of Captain Franz and Lieutenant Nowak, as well as a technical-scientific squad of 4 under command of Doctor Schmieder.//\n\n> \n\n> //The likewise dispatched MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e (\"4-Karl\") is to arrive about 10 minutes later and consists of 14 individuals under command of Captain R\u00fcberg. All members of the MTF have passed a memetic-resistance-training class \u03a8-3 and are trained for commando operations.//\n\n> \n\n> //MTF DE8-\ud835\udd0a arrives at Site-DE3 via helicopter 14 minutes after their dispatchment and proceed to the control room of Room \u16a0, in which Captain Franz, Lieutenant Nowak, and the TS-squad then are discussing with the team of Dr. Wiesmann.//\n\n> \n\n> **Cpt. Franz:** Doctor Wiesmann? Captain Franz from 8-Gustav. These are Lieutenant Nowak and the technical-scientific squad of Doctor Schmieder. Please outline the situation briefly but precisely. I will put the radio of 4-Karl, who are going to be here in a few minutes, on hands-free communication.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Wiesmann:** Good to have you here. So, you see the dome in the room's ceiling? //Points at the dome through the reinforced window.// Therein is a device of the SKP, a former Nazi-institution for anomalies, which technically is similar to a Scranton Reality Anchor and which we wanted to test. Normally it can be accessed from a room above, but the hatch is locked wherefore we could not blow it up. Our technicians have connected it to these controls and started it. There is nearly no original documentation, we reverse-engineered it as far as possible. When we started it, it began searching the whole electromagnetic spectrum, beginning with long waves and focused on a frequency of hard X-radiation, then a distortion appeared and grew to the portal you see there, which has kept its size. I presumed an imminent invasion and requested O4 to deploy you. One of my engineers is on the way to the device to restart it manually, hoping the search interrupts the portal, while a squad tries to open the hatch, yet unsuccessfully though.\n\n> \n\n> //Visible through SCP-028-DE-C, multiple armed squads of circa 120 men in total have mustered. In front of them, a person in a uniform that looks like an officer's uniform of the Wehrmacht seems to be holding a speech.//\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Schmieder:** As far as I know you neither are having a reality-expert nor someone familiar with the design of Reality Anchors? I will go to this room with the TS-Squad. I have memorized the floorplan of your facility, we will find the way by ourselves.\n\n> \n\n> **Cpt. Franz:** You do that. //To Dr. Wiesmann// We will take a position in the meantime. O4 has dispatched additional MTFs and considering the enemy's assumed amount and strength, we need everyone who can hold a gun. You will stay here.\n\n> \n\n> **Cpt. Franz via site intercom:** Captain Franz of 8-Gustav here, to all Reaction- and Security-forces: Set your radio to encrypted channel 54. Should you encounter persons in light grey uniforms, you open fire immediately. But take care of yourself, use cover and change your position.\n\n> \n\n> **Cpt. R\u00fcberg via radio:** 4-Karl to 8-Gustav, we're arriving. Let us meet in the lobby to make a plan.\n\n> \n\n> **Cpt. Franz via radio:** Good, let's meet there. As far as I can see we are running out of time, so make it on the double.\n\n> \n\n> //The MTFs are meeting with Hauptmann Armbruster, the commander of site-security, in the lobby.//\n\n> \n\n> **Cpt. Franz:** So, we do not have time, so we make it short. Hauptmann Armbruster, Captain R\u00fcberg, according to Deployment Policy 28-and-so-forth I am taking operation command. All know the site's floor plans and have read the briefing? //Short break.// Good. The site's Reaction-Forces have secured both entrances of Room Fehu. The armored doors are closed and locked. In the main corridors, barricades and firing positions have been set up. Site-Security is patrolling through the whole facility, in case a secondary portal is opened somewhere, like in incident 1. Two other MTFs are on their way from DE8 by convoy. They are arriving approximately in an hour. One is a heavy infantry platoon of a hundred, the other is an armored unit. If I remember correctly they have some of the new Tactical Power Armors. There is no specific mission plan, as we are unprepared for this threat, so we will improvise. Our mission here is to stop the imminent threat of an invasion, to avert it and to close the portal. Loss of the facility, personnel, and equipment is acceptable. For the first task, 8-Gustav will reinforce the Reaction-Forces at the armored doors. Our Technical-Scientific Squad is working on the last task in Naudis 2. Both 8ers in transfer are responsible to push back possible invaders. 4-Karl, what will you do?\n\n> \n\n> **Cpt. R\u00fcberg:** We probably would be of use at the armored doors, but we as a commando unit are better suited for counter-invasion. We will stay at the junction of the corridor, leading to both doors. The priority now is to hold up the status quo until the other MTFs arrive. Should the attackers open one door or should they attempt to open both doors, you start a counter-attack from one direction. Divert their attention to you while we are coming from the other side, trying to cross the portal and to destroy whatever technology they are having there. We are carrying explosives with us. Should we be locked in the other world, set up a memorial for us or so.\n\n> \n\n> **Cpt. Franz:** Good plan, let's make it so. Everyone to their position! Lieutenant Nowak, you take Squad 2 and go to the right.\n\n> \n\n> **Cpt. Franz via radio:** Franz to Doctor Schmieder, status?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Schmieder via radio:** Schmieder to Franz, we are in Naudis 2, the hatch here appears to be held shut by magnetic locks. The security squad which has been here already is burning a hole in it for half an hour now with a plasma cutter, which proves difficult due to the hatch's concrete filling. I advise against the destruction of the device from below, without having seen it before.\n\n> \n\n> **Cpt. Franz via radio:** Understood, continue!\n\n> \n\n> //While the squads are taking positions, and Captain Franz is instructing the MTFs in transfer via radio, the first foreign units cross the portal. The officer, who has been holding a speech before, follows the units. He is taking a mobile phone from his pocket and types in a number. The phone in the control room rings. After a pause, Dr. Wiesmann answers.//\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Wiesmann:** Doctor Wiesmann, Site-DE3?\n\n> \n\n> **Caller:** Good day doctor, this is Major Armbruster of the Waffen-SKP. I know it may not look like it, but actually, we are here for peaceful purposes. Of course, you are having units posted behind the entrances, and probably you have alarmed everybody who can carry a weapon. But before we begin with hostilities, I want to negotiate with you, the site director or someone else who is in charge.\n\n> \n\n> //This Major Armbruster seems to look very similar to Hauptmann Armbruster from Site-DE3's security. Lieutenant Yilmaz is holding up a hastily inscribed note: {{``Play for time!''}}//\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Wiesmann:** I uh... I am afraid I am not the right person, I... have to talk to O4...\n\n> \n\n> **Maj. Armbruster:** I am sure you have to. Alone to give your advancing forces some time. Just take all the time you want but do not forget this: You caught us by surprise. This here is the forces we could gather in this short time. But as we talk here, the tank battalion 64 of the Wehrmacht is securing the outer perimeter and several Mobile Einsatzkr\u00e4fte from Sondereinrichtung-4 and -8 are on their way.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Wiesmann via a secure channel to O4:** Wiesmann to O4, they... are in. Their commander wants to talk to you...\n\n> \n\n> //Short break//\n\n> \n\n> **O4-1:** O4-1 here, put me through.\n\n> \n\n> //Doctor Meier patches the call from the phone to the radio unit.//\n\n> \n\n> [SECURITY CLEARANCE LEVEL 3 CONFIRMED, ACCESS GRANTED]\n\n> \n\n> **O4-1:** This is O4-1.\n\n> \n\n> **Maj. Armbruster:** O4-1, good day. I am Major Armbruster of the Waffen-SKP. I am not used to your terminology, as you have given us false information during our last contact. Would you be so kind as to describe your position to me?\n\n> \n\n> **O4-1:** I am the chairman of the Directors' Council of the germanophone branch of the SCP Foundation. You are invaders in our universe, it's too late for cordialities!\n\n> \n\n> **Maj. Armbruster:** I understand. Is it possible to talk to a higher instance, or is each of your local Foundations autonomous?\n\n> \n\n> **O4-1:** You are talking only to me.\n\n> \n\n> **Maj. Armbruster:** Okay then. Well, as you may imagine, we are not here for research, trade or establishment of diplomatic relations. Yes, we will conquer you, that is beyond all question. We are much more technically advanced than you are. But we are no murderers. We do not want war. If you surrender now and hand us over your facility as a base of operations without resistance, lots of bloodshed can be avoided. I am aware that this decision is not an easy one, but I ask you to see the situation pragmatically. You have opened this portal; our invasion is unavoidable. Resistance only leads to suffering and death. I give you 15 minutes to decide.\n\n> \n\n> //Major Armbruster hangs up and gives orders to his units. They begin erecting mobile barricades and firing positions. The MTFs are still 30 minutes away.//\n\n> \n\n> **O4-1 via radio:** O4-1 to all forces in Site-DE3. You now are facing the probably most important task of your life: To avert a DK-class invasion-scenario. You are our first, and probably last bastion against a superior enemy. Withstand until reinforcements arrive and fight the enemy back with them! The O4-Council and I are putting all our hope in you.\n\n> \n\n> < END OF PROTOCOL >\n\n\n\nO4-1 informs O5. In an expedited procedure under the consultation of the Ethics Committee, they release an early version of protocol ``Ragnar\u00f6k'' as a last resort. O5 commences preparations and instructs O4 to put all close sites under lockdown and to mobilize their MTFs. The team of Dr. Schmieder in Room \u16be2 has been able to open the hatch in the meantime, and the team as well as Dipl. Ing. Gretenkordt is examining SCP-028-DE-B, which seems to be in some sort of standby mode and does not emit radiation.\n\n\n\nThe following are the events after the expiration of Major Armbruster's ultimatum:\n\n\n\n> < START OF PROTOCOL >\n\n> \n\n> //Major Armbruster is giving orders, whereupon two teams start applying a mass that seems similar to modeling-clay to the armored doors in the form of a rectangle. It is assumed that these are explosive cutting-charges.//\n\n> \n\n> **Lt. Yilmaz via radio:** Lieutenant Yilmaz to 8-Gustav, looks like they are preparing to breach at both armored doors.\n\n> \n\n> **Cpt. Franz via radio:** Understood. We are opening the left door. 4-Karl, you go to the right! On my mark, Squad 2 charges into the room, You follow, flank them and go through the portal. All forces, prepare yourself! Reinforcements in circa 13 minutes.\n\n> \n\n> //The Reaction Forces are taking position as the left armored door is opening slowly. The troops of the SKP are behind cover. From the control room, a soldier behind the cover can be seen as he prepares a rocket launcher.//\n\n> \n\n> **Lt. Yilmaz via radio:** Yilmaz to 8-Gustav, rocket launcher in the middle of the cover.\n\n> \n\n> **Cpt. Franz:** Understood. Grenade throwers, prepare a frag volley at the center of the emplacement.\n\n> \n\n> //The armored door has opened so far that firing would be possible. The forces of the SKP are still behind cover. The soldier with the rocket launcher changes the position.//\n\n> \n\n> **Lt. Yilmaz via radio:** Rocket launcher changes position to the left, seen from your position.\n\n> \n\n> //Major Armbruster is waving a solder to come closer, who appears to be armed with a DMR[[footnote]]Designated Marksman Rifle, a marksman rifle for medium distance, often with a larger caliber than assault rifles.[[/footnote]], points at Leutnant Yilmaz behind the reinforced window of the control room, who does not take notice. The soldier sets his rifle up a box and aims at Leutnant Yilmaz. Major Armstrong speaks something into his radio, the soldier with the rocket launcher changes position. As Lieutenant Yilmaz lifts the mouthpiece of the radio, the marksman fires one shot which pierces through the reinforced window and explodes in Yilmaz's head. The soldier with the rocket launcher leaves cover and fires the rocket, the Reaction Forces open fire at the emplacement with rifle grenades.//\n\n> \n\n> //The rocket explodes in the air behind the first cover of the Reaction Forces into a hail of shrapnel. Most of the troops in that position and half of Squad 1 of MTF DE8-\ud835\udd0a are killed or wounded. The rifle grenades explode on or behind the enemy position, though do nearly no damage to the barricade. The shrapnels of the grenades exploding behind the barricade are claiming a few victims, but the shrapnels seem not to be able to pierce through the enemy body armor.//\n\n> \n\n> **Cpt. Franz:** Switch to HE grenades, MG, suppressive fire!\n\n> \n\n> //While two medics are crawling through the position to get to the wounded, two MG gunners are emplacing their MG5 and maintain fire readiness.//\n\n> \n\n> //The rocket thrower soldier has reloaded and changed the position. On a gesture of Major Armbruster, multiple attackers are firing unaimed over their cover. The rocked thrower soldier is leaving his cover and is immediately fired on by the MGs but manages to fire a second rocket before he collapses wounded. The rocket hits into the concrete ceiling of the corridor in front of the first position and cannot spread its shrapnels as far as the first one. Nonetheless, the medics who have reached the first position and the survivors of the first rocket are being killed and additional are wounded.//\n\n> \n\n> **Cpt. Franz:** Grenades, fire!\n\n> \n\n> //The high explosive grenades are having a visibly bigger impact on the barricade of the invaders than the frag grenades. A part of the barricade tips over and buries some soldiers. Others are seemingly wounded by the blast wave.//\n\n> \n\n> **Maj. Armbruster:** Suppressive fire, flanks advance!\n\n> \n\n> //While a part of the invaders is giving aimed suppressive fire from their cover, and kill one of the MG gunners, the soldiers in the flanks of the barricade are charging forwards and are taking position on both sides of the open entrance. Major Armbruster is walking straight around the barricade in front of the first defensive position. Upon his signal, the attackers seize fire and take cover again.//\n\n> \n\n> **Maj. Armbruster:** You get a last chance. I really want no bloodshed, and I can understand that you do not want to give up. You fear to lose your way of life. You fear, that we bring you a world of war, suppression, and suffering. But do you really think it is so bad in our world? In opposition to yours, our world is at peace since the end of the war in the 50th. No local conflicts which are escalated into regional civil wars by superpowers. No capitalism, no communism. Health, welfare and educational systems that do not only exist by name but are really social. No unemployment. No epidemics. Just peace and wealth for everyone. We do not seek to conquer you, we seek to liberate you. From the yoke of your capital-elitarian suppressors. If you lay down your arms now, I swear to you, no one of you is harmed.\n\n> \n\n> //Captain Franz springs forth and fires a salvo from his assault rifle at Major Armbruster. The bullets are ricocheting from a flashing spherical energy field around the Major, and are hitting Franz in the head and torso, who collapses fatally wounded.//\n\n> \n\n> **Maj. Armbruster:** As you wish. //To his troops:// Kill them!\n\n> \n\n> //Lieutenant Nowak, who has watched through the squad-camera, has had cutting charges being placed on the right armored door already. Squad 2 of MTF DE8-\ud835\udd0a is in position with a part of the Reaction Forces and MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e and ready to charge.//\n\n> \n\n> **Lt. Nowak:** Blow it up... now!\n\n> \n\n> //The cutting charges detonate and are punching a clean slit into the armored door. Due to an angled positioning of the charges, the door first slides down a bit and then falls into the room with a crash. The waiting forces are charging into the room, opening fire on the invaders next to the other entrance, and are throwing hand grenades over the barricade on their side. The Sergeant who has taken command over the remnants of Squad 1 orders to throw hand grenades into the room too. The invaders scatter to gather anew. Major Armbruster is yelling orders, while all bullets fired at him are ricocheting from his shield back in the direction where they came from. MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e makes use of the chaos and advances through the portal, which is noticed but apparently ignored by Major Armbruster.//\n\n> \n\n> //The invaders, who are better armed and armored have killed or wounded Squad 2 of MTF DE8-\ud835\udd0a and the Reaction Forces quickly. The attackers are advancing to the next armored doors and begin placing cutting charges. A part of the attackers is staying in Room \u16a0. Security-forces from the whole facility are directed to the main corridors to support the remaining resistance, all secondary areas are being locked down. Estimated time to the arrival of reinforcements: ca. 7 minutes.//\n\n> \n\n> < END OF PROTOCOL >\n\n\n\nThe following is a transcript of recordings from MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e from reality U-3378-DE. After crossing the portal, the radio technician of the MTF has dropped an unsuspicious sender which is live transmitting the recordings of all body cameras as well as radio and transfers them through the portal by broadband infrared signals. All cameras in room \u16a0 are able to receive these signals and to direct them to the central memory unit.\n\n\n\n> < START OF PROTOCOL >\n\n> \n\n> //The MTF has reached U-3378-DE without casualties. Room \u16a0 here is not painted white but pale green, on the wall opposite of the control room, the logo of the SKP is painted, and over the control room is a modern variant of the Reichsadler with Hakenkreuz. The portal is surrounded by a spherical framework with ca. \u00d820 m, which holds a large number of unidentified devices. The armored doors of this room are closed, through the window of the control room a person that looks like Doctor Wiesmann can be seen. In the room, individuals wearing light grey overalls are multiple, which seem to be technical personnel. MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e opens fire immediately and kills everyone present.//\n\n> \n\n> **Cpt. R\u00fcberg:** What is that thing? A portal-generator?\n\n> \n\n> **MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e/4:** Well, I guess there is only one way to find out...\n\n> \n\n> //MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e/4, the engineer of the team, pulls a cordless screwdriver from his backpack, removes the screws from one of the devices, rips the cables out and throws it through the portal.//\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Wiesmann (U-3378-DE) via site intercom:** Is that how you behave as guests?\n\n> \n\n> //MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e/4 is making a rude gesture towards the control room.//\n\n> \n\n> **Cpt. R\u00fcberg:** Fuck it, place the charges. The rest provides cover.\n\n> \n\n> //MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e/7, the demolition expert of the team, and MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e/8 begin to plant charges in different locations of the framework, and to connect them to a wireless detonator. Meanwhile, an armored door opens - significantly faster than those in Site-DE3 - and a group of armed men charges into the room. Both groups are immediately opening fire upon each other. Thanks to their elite training, MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e can quickly eliminate the defenders, though not without suffering casualties, among them demolition expert MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e/7. Cpt. R\u00fcberg leaves the detonator near the framework, so possible advancing own troops do not have to search for it and proceed through the open armored door deeper into the facility. They encounter only low resistance, the invaders under the command of Major Armbruster seem to be the Reaction Forces of the site, while remaining and inferior equipped forces seem to be normal security personnel. They quickly reach the control room which is secured by a code lock; the code is the same as in the known reality though. Without hesitating, MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e terminates the guards, Dr. Wiesmann, Dr. Meier, Dipl. Ing. Gretenkordt as well as Lt. Yilmaz who in opposition to the other forces does not wear a light grey but a sand-colored uniform with insignia that appear to be of the Ottoman Empire.//\n\n> \n\n> **MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e/2:** Dude, how crazy is it that they have the same people here? Do you think we will meet ourselves here?\n\n> \n\n> **Cpt. R\u00fcberg:** I would rather not. Do the controls tell you anything?\n\n> \n\n> **MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e/2:** No, the fuckers have locked the controls before we shot them. No time to search for passwords.\n\n> \n\n> **Cpt. R\u00fcberg:** Plant a charge and then we proceed to Naudis 2.\n\n> \n\n> //MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e/8 plants the charge on the controls and connects it with a second detonator. The MTF proceeds to Naudis 2 and kills the guards.//\n\n> \n\n> **MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e/3:** Man, shit. The hatch is locked, same as back home!\n\n> \n\n> **Cpt. R\u00fcberg:** Then place the rest of the charges, maybe it's enough.\n\n> \n\n> //MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e/8 places the remaining charges and connects them to the detonator.//\n\n> \n\n> **Cpt. R\u00fcberg:** And off we go! Back to room Fehu. Then we blow their shit up!\n\n> \n\n> //On the way back, MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e runs into a large group of soldiers, seemingly a part of the reinforcements. They pull back into a side corridor, and while the biggest part of the troops proceed to Room \u16a0, a squat halts and follows them into the corridor.//\n\n> \n\n> **R\u00fcberg (U-3378-DE):** There they are, 4-Karl follow me! //To MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e:// We are MEK 4-\ud835\udd0e, let us talk before we shoot each other.\n\n> \n\n> **Cpt. R\u00fcberg:** Seriously? What the hell do you want to talk about?\n\n> \n\n> **R\u00fcberg (U-3378-DE):** You won't believe it, but even here you do not meet yourself from another universe all day. And as I see you too have the scar from SKP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 //(SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588-DE)//, just on the other side.\n\n> \n\n> **Cpt. R\u00fcberg:** Are you shitting me? Man, first you invade our universe as conquerers, and you are coming with romantic shit like ``oh - I'm meeting myself from another world - I must gabble instead of shooting''!? Fuck you man!\n\n> \n\n> //Cpt. R\u00fcberg yanks his gun up and shoots his equivalent through the open visor of his helmet. MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e and MEK 4-\ud835\udd0e are opening fire upon each other, and thanks to the numerical superiority and better equipment of their opponents, MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e is being eliminated while MEK 4-\ud835\udd0e suffers no further casualties.//\n\n> \n\n> //Through the camera of MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e/2 who lays on the floor, a squad in Tactical Power Armor can be seen, walking past the corridor towards Room \u16a0.//\n\n> \n\n> < END OF PROTOCOL >\n\n\n\nAround the time as MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e enters the control room in U-3378-DE, the reinforcements in form of MTF DE8-\ud835\udd05 and -\u212d arrive. MTF DE8-\ud835\udd05 is a heavy infantry unit of around 100 men with body armor and squads with ballistic shields. MTF DE8-\u212d is an armored unit with three armored vehicles with autocannons, a truck with a 105 mm cannon hidden on its load bed, as well as a squad equipped with the newly introduced Tactical Power Armor, it's supply squad and supporting heavy infantry.\n\n\n\nThe following is a transcript of the recordings from room \u16be2, in which the technical-scientific squad of MTF DE8-\ud835\udd0a is working, at the time the ultimatum of Major Armbruster is running out (15 minutes before the reinforcements arrive):\n\n\n\n> < START OF PROTOCOL >\n\n> \n\n> //In room \u16be2, there are the technical-scientific squad of MTF DE8-\ud835\udd0a led by Dr. Schmieder, Dipl. Ing. Gretenkordt and a team of guards of Site-DE3. The squad has opened the hatch in the floor and Dr. Schmieder, Dipl. Ing. Gretenkordt as well as two other members of the technical-scientific squad have entered the low room and are examining SCP-028-DE-B.//\n\n> \n\n> **Gretenkordt:** So, do you have a clue what that thing is, Doctor Reality?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Schmieder:** How dare you!\n\n> \n\n> **Gretenkordt:** Sorry. Doctor Schmieder.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Schmieder:** Better... To answer your question, yes, I have. Your original assumption that this is some sort of early Scranton Reality Anchor is correct in general, but to be more precise it is only working like an SRA. To make it short, there is a measure for reality, the Hume. The reality usually is around 20 Hm. The more hume, the more stable the reality. The abilities of reality benders are usually based on changing the measure of reality in themselves or their surroundings, and to change the reality according to their will. SRAs are machines that add or remove reality from dead or empty universes, to create fields of stable reality, usually at about 20 Hm. This device here is working similarly, but it also is an interareal transmitter. The dome seems to be the cover of a parabolic dish, with which the device is focussing its effect on one point.\n\n> \n\n> //Noise of battle can be heard from Room \u16a0.//\n\n> \n\n> **Gretenkordt:** Ok, but do you have an idea if we can use it?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Schmieder:** That depends on whether my assumption about how it works is correct. I assume that it starts with a search for the right frequency, which is why it has covered the whole electromagnetic spectrum. To be able to send intrareal, it probably has created a minimally small zone of extremely low reality in a defined point, through which the radiation can leave our universe and enter another universe with a similar zone of extremely low reality within reach, to establish communication. I assume it was originally built to send aimlessly into the ``intrareal space'', as like we are sending messages aimlessly into space to see if someone answers. In the universe now standing wide open down there, they probably have built the same device which has still been in operation. They must have known that we exist and maybe just have waited for us to send. Then they have sent a signal back and this device has enlarged the zone of low reality in synchronization with theirs. They must have another apparatus there to stabilize the low-reality zone into a portal.\n\n> \n\n> **Gretenkordt:** Do you think this device can raise the reality instead of lowering it?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Schmieder:** Yes I do, and I think that is our only chance to end this. And as this old device does not have digital controls, it should be enough to rewire it a bit.\n\n> \n\n> //It takes approximately 20 minutes to make the modifications. The reinforcements have arrived on both sides and are engaged in a fierce battle. The SKP is using it's Tactical Power Armor to secure Room \u16a0 while those of the Foundation and the troops in front of them with ballistic shields are forming moveable barricades in the corridors and are supporting the troops with their heavy weapons. Thanks to the nano-coated armor of the Tactical Power Armor, they are extremely well protected against fire from most weapons.//\n\n> \n\n> //As the troops of the SKP are pushed back to Room \u16a0, a firefight between the Power Armored squads of both sides breaks loose, which seems to be coequal, though the battle involves heavy losses among the infantry. From SCP-028-DE-C, more troops of the SKP push through while troops of the Foundation are advancing from the corridors. More MTFs and Reaction Forces from close facilities are on their way to Site-DE3. The early version of protocol ``Ragnar\u00f6k'' is ready for execution.//\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Schmieder via radio:** This is Doctor Schmieder of MTF DE8-Gustav to mission control; come in, please!\n\n> \n\n> **Mission control via radio:** This is\u00a0\u00a0Major Peters, mission control. You are the reality expert, right?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Schmieder via radio:** Correct, Major, I think we have a chance to destabilize the portal, but there must be a machine or device on the other side, holding the portal open. Let your troops search and destroy it!\n\n> \n\n> **Mission control via radio:** There is something, indeed. Some sort of framework around the portal. Is that what you mean?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Schmieder via radio:** That is hard to say without having seen it, but in absence of options I have to say yes. Have it destroyed.\n\n> \n\n> //From the transmission of MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e it is known that there have been charges planted on the framework and that the detonator may still be laying there. The Tactical Power Armor squad is ordered to recover the detonator, to detonate the charges without detonator or to destroy the devices with their heavy weapons.//\n\n> \n\n> //The Tactical Power Armor squad manages to advance through the portal, followed by the Power Armors of the SKP. The detonator is nowhere to be found, and the charges have been removed, though they are still in a crate in the room. The troops of the Foundation can move the crate with the charges to the middle of the room and detonate it with direct fire.//\n\n> \n\n> //The machinery around SCP-028-DE-C is damaged and breaks down. However, the portal does not collapse but it ``bursts'' and suddenly expands to a diameter of ca. \u00d850 m. It does not seem to have a defined ``hull'' and appears to taper off gradually. Within the affected zone, the reality seems to be undefined. Personnel reports, that both realities are perceived alternating and that the perception can change after blinking or a fast turn. All personnel in the affected zone seem to exist in both universes at the same time and are visible on all cameras (some live-feeds from cameras of the SKP can be recorded now due to overlapping cables). In opposition, inanimate objects apparently stay in ``their'' universes. Electromagnetic signals appear to exist in both realities.//\n\n> \n\n> //Guards of the SKP appear in Room \u16be2 and are overpowered. Everywhere in the corridors personnel of the SKP appears, and heavy fights break loose.//\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Schmieder:** //Is visibly startled.// What the hell... where does that control board come from?\n\n> \n\n> //Dr. Schmieder\u2019s shoulder camera is in the normal universe and no control board is visible.//\n\n> \n\n> **Gretenkordt:** What control board?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Schmieder:** Wait, you do not see a control board there?\n\n> \n\n> **Gretenkordt:** No!? Doctor, what is going on? And where did those guys come from?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Schmieder:** You are asking questions... if I interpret the boom-sound correctly, the MTFs have blown something up and I would assume it was the portal stabilizing device. I do not know how it works, but I think we are inside the portal. Without the stabilization, both universes seem to exist coincidentally. We are now threatened by a Universe-conjunction, multiple universes merging to one, and therewith a permanent transition, or a hole that devours both universes. Both are to be prevented, so I suggest we start the device here and hope it reestablishes reality.\n\n> \n\n> //Dr. Schmieder is starting up SCP-028-DE-B. It begins searching.//\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Schmieder via radio:** Schmieder to mission control, I highly advise to protect the device in Naudis 2 with utmost priority! And nobody shall leave the anomaly! I repeat: The anomaly must //not// be left!\n\n> \n\n> **Mission control via radio:** Mission control understands. Stay there and hold your ground.\n\n> \n\n> //As not required troops are withdrawn and partly are send to protect room \u16be2, the remaining heavy and armored units are engaging the troops of the SKP in stationary combat in Room \u16a0, also to distract them from the dome. Major Armbruster of the SKP has been killed by a Tactical Power Armor in melee combat.//\n\n> \n\n> //SCP-028-DE-B is running through the spectrum of visible light and reaches and focusses on hard X-radiation. Apparently, its equivalent from U-3378-DE (SCP-028-DE-B-1) is responding automatically, and as this is lowering the measure of reality, the SCP-028-DE-B on this side is raising reality. The imbalance seems to have a negative impact on the universe U-3378-DE, as the camera feeds received from there are showing an expansion of the anomaly, while it is contracting on this side.//\n\n> \n\n> //The expansion of the anomaly appears to be detected by some security systems, as it seems that SCP-028-DE-B-1 is switched and now also is stabilizing the reality, otherwise it assumably would have come to a reality collapse in U-3378-DE.//\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Schmieder via non-encrypted radio:** Dr. Schmieder to all units: The anomaly is closing, seize fire and do as I say if you do not want to end up in the wrong universe!\n\n> \n\n> //The units of both sides are seizing fire hesitantly and are taking cover. Mission control decides not to intervene.//\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Schmieder via non-encrypted radio:** You surely have noticed, that sometimes you are perceiving this universe, sometimes that. I cannot guarantee that my theory works, but I do not have a better one. I assume you always are existing in the universe you are seeing. At least that would explain the function of a spatial portal. When the boundary of the anomaly is approaching you, blink before it reaches you until you see the desired reality. Keep your eyes open as long as possible and avoid all movement. The boundary of the anomaly is fluxionary; you will not notice when you are through. If you manage to blink in the wrong moment, you might be facing much more dire consequences than ``just'' ending up in the wrong universe: Eternal agony in the void between the worlds.\n\n> \n\n> //The anomaly is contracting and seems to be closing at last.//\n\n> \n\n> < END OF PROTOCOL >\n\n\n\nMost troops managed to return to ``their'' universe, though \u2588 members of the SKP remained and were arrested for thorough questioning. The Foundation has lost \u2588 members in U-3378-DE; they are regarded as MIA. Personnel whose equivalent from U-3378-DE are stranded in ``our'' universe have been amnestized accordingly to prevent them from trying to establish contact.\n\n\n\nThe equipment of the forces of the SKP has been examined in detail. Most military equipment, as well as their Tactical Power Armor, was manufactured by the company ``Richter und Thiel Industriegesellschaft mbH'', which by name and logo seems to be an equivalent of the Group of Interest Raptor Tec. Industries.\n\n\n\nOn the same day, Scranton Reality Anchors have been flown in from the USA and taken into operation. SCP-028-DE-B has been analyzed, but no new technology could be derived from it. It was dismantled and is now stored on Site-DE\u2588\u2588. According to analyses the device which was removed from the framework around SCP-028-DE-C and had been thrown through it by MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e, belongs to a cluster of emitters similar to Scranton Reality Buoys, that generate a spherical field to stabilize SCP-028-DE-C. They are compressing the portal until it takes a spherical form with a ``stable'' outer hull, similar to a gas that is liquified by pressure.\n\n\n\nSCP-028-DE-C has been closed but did not disappear. It still exists as an anomaly of extremely low reality with a size of a few picometers, through which very weak X-radiation intrudes permanently since six months after Incident 028-DE/I2. It is yet unknown if and how the anomaly can be closed completely.\n\n\n\nThe currently effective Special Containment Procedures have been established based on insights derived from the recordings and captured documents of this incident.\n\n\n\n**Note:**\n\n[[div style=\"font-family: times, serif; font-size: 105%\"]]\n\n> As the SKP still exists in U-3378-DE, we can assume that the Nazis have won in that universe.

Each section has a size of 6 \u00d7 4 m. They are electromagnetically connected on the long sides (resulting in a size of 6 \u00d7 8 m combined). The section facing the center of the room hereafter is designated as Platform 1, the aft section as Platform 2. Both platforms and their superstructures are armored against gunfire up to explosive grenades caliber 40 mm.\n\n\n\nPlatform 1 has no own propulsion and its wheels are blocked automatically when it is disconnected. Platform 1 carries an Impulse-Hume-Emitter (IHE 1505) with an output of 15 Hm per pulse and a frequency of 0.5 Hz. It is powered by a constantly fully loaded fusion-accumulator, holding enough power for 20 pulses.\n\n\n\nPlatform 2 contains the engine of the platforms as well as controls, electronics, and an armored pillbox with shooting slits and grenade machine guns in armored ball casings. This platform carries 8 SRAs in an even arrangement.\n\n\n\nUnder normal conditions, all SRAs in Room \u16a0 are offline and are sequentially started in test-mode daily, as well as the electronics of the IHE and the platforms. All damage and malfunctions are to be eliminated instantly with utmost priority. The ignition mechanism of the IHE is in possession by the site-director.\n\n\n\n**Preparation of protocol ``Mj\u00f6lnir'':** Upon transmission of the codeword ``Heimdall'', the installation described above is put into standby and the 36 SRAs around SCP-028-DE-C are to be started up to normal operation. The site-director hands the ignition mechanism over to the reality-expert on duty, who installs it into the IHE. The Reaction-Forces are ingesting the memetic agent W04178/A (W04178/A is a memetically active methamphetamine that, in addition to the normal effect of methamphetamine, suppresses the ability to feel fear and increases the obedience). They man Platform 2 and establish readiness to fire. All personnel not necessary is evacuated from Room \u16a0 and the armored doors are locked.\n\n\n\n**Execution of protocol ``Mj\u00f6lnir'':** This protocol must be executed exactly as described below:\n\n# The Reaction-Forces are ordered to open fire on all hostile forces. The grenade launchers must not open fire yet to not damage the facility, except it is unavoidable for the successful execution of the protocol.\n\n# The 36 SRAs around SCP-028-DE-C are throttled to 80% output.\n\n# The combined platform drives through SCP-028-DE-C and in there 10 m farther.\n\n# As soon as SCP-028-DE-C is crossed, the Reaction-Forces fire the grenade launchers at the SCP-028-DE-D.\n\n# Once the platform has reached its target, Platform 1 is disconnected.\n\n# Platform 2 drives backward through SCP-028-DE-C at top speed.\n\n# As soon as Platform 2 has left SCP-028-DE-C it gives a signal to Platform 1 via infrared lights.\n\n# The output of the 36 SRAs around SCP-028-DE-C is increased to 100%.\n\n# Exactly 2 seconds after Platform 2 has given the signal, Platform 2 quick-starts its SRAs to 200% output. The probability that SCP-028-DE-C thereby is closed is approximately 82%.\n\n# 0.5 s after SCP-028-DE-C is confirmed to be closed, the IHE 1505 is triggered. As a result, U-3378-DE is overloaded by up to 300 Hm in an area of 8 km, which causes it to ``solidify'' and become unstable. In case that SCP-028-DE-C, in opposition to the readings, has not been closed then, the effect will also occur here, though only within 3 km around SCP-028-DE.\n\n\n\nIf Platform 2 does not manage to leave SCP-028-DE-C within 60 seconds after entering U-3378-DE, article 8 becomes effective anyway and Platform 2 is trapped in U-3378-DE. Therefore, the Reaction-Forces are allowed to abandon the platform and try to return on foot.\n\n\n\nShould the IHE 1505 not be fired, destroyed before being fired or it does not have the expected result, Protocol \u201cRagnar\u00f6k\u201d [clearance level 4/O4 required] is to be executed.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:coltop\">component:coltop</a> show=+ Open protocol \u201cRagnar\u00f6k\u201d|hide=- Access granted]]\n\n[[div style=\"font-family: times, serif; font-size: 105%\"]]\n\n> While you are allowed to take an insight into the following, I highly recommend refraining from doing so.

Its pilots are made obedient with a memetic agent and the staff of the base's HQ consists of agents of the Foundation. Upon transmission of the codeword ``Heimdall'', the TaktLwG 33 loads four (4) Tornado IDS fighter-bombers with one (1) B61 Mod 11 nuclear bomb each (a bunker buster, able to penetrate Site-DE3's structure). The planes then fly to a stand-by position over SCP-028-DE.\n\n\n\nAs the execution of ``Ragnar\u00f6k'' is ordered, all bombers drop their bomb on SCP-028-DE and depart. The number of immediate casualties is presumed to exceed 135,000 due to the proximity to an urban center.\n\n\n\nIt is assumed that SCP-028-DE-C and -D are therewith destroyed and Room \u16a0 is buried.

It resembles a young human male with an athletic physique, with facial lineaments similar to those of the Greek-roman sculpting technique; it wears a short <em>toga</em>.</p>\n<p>SCP-032-IT\u2019s joints are articulated, thus allowing movement. The object shows a paraskeletric tubular structure, with universal joints that allow a wide array of fine movements, even in the fingers, thus closely resembling human movement. SCP-032-IT is capable of autonomous movement perceived by observers as \u201cvery natural\u201d, and is also capable of articulating human speech, making it able to sustain a meaningful conversation.</p>\n<p>SCP-032-IT is self-conscious and, besides the aforementioned languages, is not able to learn new means of communication; it is nonetheless able to learn new concepts and definitions with the same cognitive skills as an average adult human.</p>\n<p>Similarly to a regular bronze statue, SCP-032-IT is hollow; however, its insides are not empty, as they house both the aforementioned tubular structure, and a complex system of interconnected gears the constructive technology of which is compatible with that of ancient machines. It is noteworthy that the mechanical section KY94, located in the anterior thoracic region, has a 98% match with the architecture of the Antikytera Mechanism. This whole apparatus allows SCP-032-IT to actuate the fine movements of its limbs; however, how these movements are achieved in the first place is yet to be understood, as its structure makes it nothing more than a complex audio-animatronic, as observable by the structural chart reconstructed based on 3D X-ray analysis of the object.</p>\n<p>If damaged, SCP-032-IT is able to revert itself to its original shape via a self-repairing process similar to biological wound regeneration; the process, however, is significantly slower by around 8 times when compared to the normal scarring process of a human being. SCP-032-IT is able to achieve this regeneration even after having lost most of its initial mass, including the internal machinery; however, SCP-032-IT is no longer able to fully recover the damages on its outer surface following the prolonged stay on the oceanic floor (see <a href=\"#recovery-log\">Recovery Log</a> for details).</p>\n<p>SCP-032-IT has no need for sustenance. If the object needs repairs, though, it may require small bronze fragments (no bigger than 5\u00a0cm<sup>3</sup>) to ingest; these fragments end up in a metallic sack in the abdominal area. Using photoemission spectroscopy, it has been discovered that these fragments are slowly absorbed into the sack\u2019s walls with a rate of approximately 0.78\u00a0g/day; the sack itself, for the duration of the phenomenon, has a temperature of 2\u00b10.1 \u00baC higher than the surrounding materials.</p>\n<p>When questioned regarding its identity, SCP-032-IT maintains its name to be Spurinna and to be a haruspex. It further states that it is \u201cunder the new sky\u201d since the year 790 BCE, although being created at least 900 years before that. When questioned on the meaning of \u201cnew sky\u201d, the objects state that it has noticed not to be in its \u201coriginal place\u201d, although this one is very similar; it further states that, under the new sky, it has not yet found any haruspex or augur similar to itself.</p>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25ba\u00a0Update\u00a021/02/2017\u00a0(Retractable\u00a0appendages\u00a0|\u00a0Foretellings)</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25bc\u00a0Close</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p><strong>Update 21/02/2017</strong><br/>\nSCP-032-IT is noted to possess long appendages with circular sections, approximately 7\u00a0mm in diameter and with pointed ends, completely retractable, and articulated in 5 different points for a total length of 28\u00a0cm that, when retracted, are completely hidden from sight inside the outer surface of the object.

Eugenia Manchi (SIR-I)<br/>\n<strong>Interviewed:</strong> Mr. Alfredo Panicucci<br/>\n<strong>Foreword:</strong> Mr. Panicucci left room 710 ~2 minutes before the incident, and the time of the explosion he was going back to the room; he was knocked down by the detonation, but was far enough from it that he suffered only minor injuries. The original interview was conducted in Italian; it has been translated for this version of the file.</p>\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><strong>&lt;beginning of excerpt&gt;</strong></p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<strong>Agt. Manchi:</strong> What were you doing at that moment?\n<p><strong>Mr. Panicucci:</strong> I was called by the patient in room 711, who complained about the ringtone of a smartphone from the adjacent room.</p>\n<p><strong>Agt. Manchi:</strong> And what did you do?</p>\n<p><strong>Mr. Panicucci:</strong> I went to room 710 and asked Miss D\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 to switch her phone to silent mode, but she refused to do it.</p>\n<p><strong>Agt. Manchi:</strong> Why?</p>\n<p><strong>Mr. Panicucci:</strong> She told me that lately she had been very bothered by the vibration of her phone\u2026 That she couldn't stand it, because it \"echoed\" in her head.</p>\n<p><strong>Agt. Manchi:</strong> \"Echoed\"?</p>\n<p><strong>Mr. Panicucci:</strong> That's the word she used.</p>\n<p><strong>Agt. Manchi:</strong> Then what did you do?</p>\n<p><strong>Mr. Panicucci:</strong> I told miss D\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 about the complaints, and she switched her phone to the vibration mode, but she was very reluctant.</p>\n<p><strong>Agt. Manchi:</strong> I see. What happened then?</p>\n<p><strong>Mr. Panicucci:</strong> I had to bring some test results to the second floor, but by the time I reached the elevator I heard a strange noise.</p>\n<p><strong>Agt. Manchi:</strong> How was it strange?</p>\n<p><strong>Mr. Panicucci:</strong> It was like\u2026 I don't know how to describe it\u2026 Ah, like someone was humming, making a motorboat sound\u2026 I cannot describe it better than that. And it was reverberating in the hallway.</p>\n<p><strong>Agt. Manchi:</strong> Understood. And what did you do, then?</p>\n<p><strong>Mr. Panicucci:</strong> It sounded like it was coming from behind me, so I headed back towards room 710. I was halfway there when the room exploded.</p>\n<p><strong>Agt. Manchi:</strong> What do you remember of the event?</p>\n<p><strong>Mr. Panicucci:</strong> Just a couple seconds before the explosion the sound got louder\u2026 Then everything flashed white. I fell, and lost consciousness for\u2026 Some minutes, I guess.</p>\n<p><strong>Agt. Manchi:</strong> Were you injured?</p>\n<p><strong>Mr. Panicucci:</strong> Yes, but nothing serious\u2026 A couple scratches here\u2026 And here\u2026 On my knee\u2026 And the post-traumatic effect, also.</p>\n<p><strong>Agt. Manchi:</strong> What kind of effect?</p>\n<p><strong>Mr. Panicucci:</strong> I was probably influenced by what the patient said\u2026 it's probably a hysteric reaction I am having.</p>\n<p><strong>Agt. Manchi:</strong> Can you elaborate?</p>\n<p><strong>Mr. Panicucci:</strong> The vibration of my phone\u2026 It bothers me now, to the point of discomfort\u2026 The vibration \"expands\" into my head, somehow. Must be psychological, a PSTD-like effect or something\u2026 It should vanish by itself in a while\u2026 Am I right?</p>\n<p><strong>Agt. Manchi:</strong> Indeed, Mr. Panicucci.

The containment wing is under the jurisdiction of Site-8120. When inside the containment wing, personnel are advised to never look inside SCP-040-JP. If it is needed to look inside SCP-040-JP, it should be done through the camera and not directly with the naked eye. If it is necessary to have a direct view, it is advised to use D-class personnel. Communication with personnel who have been exposed to SCP-040-JP is forbidden.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-040-JP is a well located in the village of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, in the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 prefecture. It is surrounded by a wooden hut, measuring approximately 5\u00a0m wide and 4\u00a0m long. The center of the hut houses a stone well presumed to have been built in ancient times, which descends directly underground. The well is anomalously deep and multiple probes have failed to determine its depth.</p>\n<p>Although the hut was originally locked tightly with iron chains and multiple padlocks, they have since broken due to deterioration. SCP-040-JP was placed into containment after Incident [REDACTED] in 1967.</p>\n<p><em>[Warning: After Incident-040-JP-001 in 19\u2588\u2588, the following contents are prohibited for viewing without memetic countermeasures.

Furthermore, the person will become obsessed with the idea that \"the cat is here\". This effect is not apparent in drawings or images; it only occurs when a person views the inside of the cabin with the naked eye. A camera image only displays the inside of the hut with no sign of the reported cats.</p>\n<p>Exposure to the object will distort the subject's perception of all domestic cats (scientific name: <em>Felis silvestris catus</em>). During interviews with exposed subjects, they reported that any domestic cat seemed to look like an animal with two human eyes on its face without hair or other features, staring at them directly when viewed from any direction.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the exposed subjects will begin to report that the cat is constantly appearing in the darkness to observe them. There seems to be no consistency in the level of darkness required for the cat to be manifest in. It is unknown why the cat observes subjects.</p>\n<p>An illustration of the observed cat is attached below.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:0%;\">\u3000</span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:0%;\">\u3000</span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:0%;\">\u3000</span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:0%;\">\u3000</span></p>\n\n<p>According to a survey conducted by Foundation researchers, it was determined that the location where the cat appears is influenced by the position of the subject's ocular lens or the cornea. In other words, the sightings occur statistically significantly higher in the subject's peripheral vision. This property was demonstrated during experimentation with D-Class in 19\u2588\u2588. According to the hypothesis proposed by [REDACTED], it is speculated that the dark places in the large depths of the underground structure inside SCP-040-JP have a clear influence on this.</p>\n<p>[DATA EXPUNGED]</p>\n<p>Subjects exposed to SCP-040-JP will actively tell others about the idea that \"there is a cat\". Those who have understood this idea to some extent suffer the same cognitive anomaly as the subjects who were initially exposed. It is not known whether the effect is transmitted through a general description or whether a specific trigger word exists, but it is a cat.</p>\n<p>There is a cat. There are no particular restrictions on the medium necessary to convey that idea, and it is effective even in all media such as speech, writing, images, and paintings. Therefore, it is speculated that the subjects themselves are not directly affected, but carry a memetic anomaly (refer to document [REDACTED]). It was there. Affected subjects do not act in a suspicious manner, making it difficult to judge whether or not the subject is under the influence of the anomaly after passing through the first stage of exposure. It was a cat</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:0%;\">\u3000</span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:0%;\">\u3000</span><br/>\nThank you<br/></p>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">-\u00a0Close</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<em>[End of Memetic Hazard.]</em>\n<p><strong>Incident Report 040-JP-001:</strong> On \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/19\u2588\u2588, a large-scale memetic disaster occurred in Site-8120 as a result of this report.

But don't worry: just wanting it is enough.</span></p>\n<p>Let's start.</p>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"bianco\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b6\u00a0Step\u00a00\u00a0|\u00a0Clean\u00a0Slate</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25c0\u25c0\u25c0\u00a0Close\u00a0Step\u00a0Zero</a></div>\n\n<p>Before we set out, we need to wipe the slate clean of everything that is inside your mind. <span style=\"color: gold\">Ren\u00e9 Descartes</span> realized the importance of this by writing:</p>\n<div class=\"sfondo-cartesio\">\n<p><span class=\"descartes\">I could, however, select from the crowd no one whose opinions seemed worthy of preference, and thus I found myself constrained, as it were, to use my own reason in the conduct of my life.

Macroscopic organs, such as eyes and hears, function through a multitude of microscopic units, a <span style=\"color: gold\">sensor network</span>: the neurosensory receptors. <span class=\"grigio\">You have many of them: mechanoreceptors<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-8\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')\">8</a></sup>, photoreceptors, nociceptors<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-9\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-9')\">9</a></sup>, thermoreceptors<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-10\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-10')\">10</a></sup>, and so on.</span></p>\n<p>Sensor damage causes a malfunction of the associated sense. <span class=\"grigio\">As an example, a person affected by <em>congenital achromatopsia</em> has color blindness due to severe malfunction of color-sensitive photoreceptors.</span></p>\n<p>A human's perception of the world is therefore altered if the sensor network is not in optimal conditions. But there is more. Here is my first teaching of the path to the Sublime One:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #16A085\"><em>Even with an optimal sensor network, the human being does not have have a true perception of the world.</em></span></p>\n<p>The problem lies in the brain. Look at this image:</p>\n\n<p>Are the A and B squares of two different colors? Highlight the following space for the answer: <span style=\"color: black\">No</span>. <span class=\"grigio\">You can verify that by downloading the image and cancelling everything but the A and B squares.</span></p>\n<p>Just like sight, all senses are affected by it, since they all head to the brain. You have never seen, heard, smelled, tasted nor touched reality like it really is, the <span style=\"color: gold\">kantian noumenon</span>, but only how the algorithms inherent in your nervous system make it look.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #16A085\"><strong>Veil of Perception</strong>: <em>Perception is deceptive.</em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"blu\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b6\u00a0Step\u00a02\u00a0|\u00a0Cognitive\u00a0Veil</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25c0\u25c0\u25c0\u00a0Close\u00a0Step\u00a0Two</a></div>\n\n<br/>\nNow, let's lift the second veil which conceals the Sublime One.\n<p>This veil is the conceptual analogue of the previous one. Just like perception is deceptive, so is <span style=\"color: gold\">language</span>. Like a barrier, language limits the human being, alienating him from information that lies beyond its boundary.</p>\n<p>Here, though, there is an important difference: some languages do not have such limits. Sadly, they're abstract languages, which the human brain can elaborate only with much difficulty. But the natural language, the one you use every day, the one you're reading now.<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>.<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>. there's nothing more deceptive. <span class=\"grigio\">For a long time I have hypothesized alternative ways of communication, but this virtual letter is the most direct way, even if bristling with obstacles.</span></p>\n<p>We can now, shyly, get closer to the following truth:<br/></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #3498DB\"><em>Unless we use formally perfect language, human beings are limited in the cognitive sphere.</em></span></p>\n<p>The most brilliant mathematicians and the greatest linguists approach the purity of language. But even for them error lurks around the corner, like a snake ready to strike, and profound knowledge is plunged into the abyss of the unknown.</p>\n<p>Like a black hole, true knowledge is <span style=\"color: gold\">invisible</span>: we can see its effects on the surroundings. We know it's there, but the event horizon prevents us from seeing beyond it.</p>\n<p>The following words will then sound quite natural:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #3498DB\"><strong>Cognitive Veil</strong>: <em>Your mind is the horizon of cognitive events.</em></span></p>\n<p>And now we will pass it trough together.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"giallo\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b6\u00a0Step\u00a03\u00a0|\u00a0Umwelt</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25c0\u25c0\u25c0\u00a0Close\u00a0Step\u00a0Three</a></div>\n\n<br/>\nLet's lift now the <em>Veil of Maya</em>, in the words of <span style=\"color: gold\">Arthur Schopenhauer</span>.\n<p>The two previous veils, combined, trap the human being in a bubble of perceived nature on one hand and of cognitive nature on the other. What you can perceive with senses and what you can think of (including imagination) constitutes your <span style=\"color: gold\">Umwelt</span>, that is, your subjective universe.</p>\n<p>A third veil keeps them firmly together.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #FFFF00\"><strong>Veil of Maya</strong>: <em>Every human being lives in their own Umwelt.</em></span></p>\n<p>But this is what your kind, before you, has thought at this point:</p>\n<p><span class=\"dancing\" style=\"font-size: 24px;\">Where are the promised answers?<br/>\nWhere is the role of the human being in the universe?<br/>\nWhere is the meaning of life?</span></p>\n<p>Be patient. Deep answers are not daughters of hurrying.</p>\n<p>Despite being imprisoned in their respective Umwelt, humans have realized the existence of a common substrate. This substrate is perceived and known in a different way by everyone, but demonstrates a high degree of consistency between different observers. <span class=\"grigio\">Substrate sensory discrepancies depend on defects in the sensor network or the neural algorithms processing its signals. Those cognitive discrepancies are often called \"madness\".</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #FFFF00\"><em>Reality is the objective substrate common to every Umwelt.</em></span></p>\n<p>And this substrate has a beating heart. That's where we're going.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"arancio\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b6\u00a0Step\u00a04\u00a0|\u00a0Information</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25c0\u25c0\u25c0\u00a0Close\u00a0Step\u00a0Four</a></div>\n\n<br/>\nReality is the most complex machine in existence.\n<p>Despite being so complex, its purpose is wide but relatively easy: to elaborate information. Every physical phenomenon, from a lightning to a dewdrop falling from a leaf, it's the result of an elaboration.</p>\n<p>Reality, intended as the objective substrate at the base of everything, it's nothing but this: <span style=\"color: gold\">information</span>. Everything else is perceived reality, subjective universes. <span class=\"grigio\">Bringers of information are the quantum fields.</span></p>\n<p>You too, therefore, are information. <span class=\"grigio\">Hear me out now, because I have to do something a little difficult.</span></p>\n<p>An electron is described by its quantum numbers, which represent the <em>state</em> of a particle. <span class=\"grigio\"><em>Spin</em> is the most famous quantum number.</span></p>\n<p>The principle of <span style=\"color: gold\">indistinctness</span> applies: if you swap two electrons with the same quantum numbers, then the resulting quantum field is unchanged, thus the information is the same. <span class=\"grigio\">Another example: take ten electrons from a stone. Change their quantum numbers in such a way that they are equal to ten of your electrons. Throw away your electrons and put the stone ones where yours were before. The result is that nothing has changed.</span></p>\n<p>The previous principle applies to every subatomic particle, not just electrons. Therefore, if ideally I replaced every single particle of your body with a particle, taken from who knows where, but located in the same position and with the same quantum numbers, nothing would change.</p>\n<p><span class=\"grigio\">Actually\u2026 I just did that. As I said, the information hasn't changed. And the information includes your Umwelt, thus your memories and your perceptions. See? You're always yourself\u2026 I think. Yes, you see, my quantum transfer system is not <em>that</em> precise, some little error can happen every now and then\u2026 but you're still alive, am I right? Excellent, let's continue.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b6\u00a0Step\u00a05\u00a0|\u00a0Life</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25c0\u25c0\u25c0\u00a0Close\u00a0Step\u00a0Five</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Looking at life through a microscope, we can see cells.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: red\"><em>A cell is a complex bio-machine, which executes millions of chemical reactions every second. But this is not what makes it alive.</em></span></p>\n<p>No part of a cell is alive. The cell membrane is made of phospholipids, glycoproteins and other chemicals. The same goes for ribosomes, mitochondria, the Golgi apparatus, the nucleus, in short everything.</p>\n<p>But you already know what a cell is for: to elaborate information. This machine (the cell) encodes the most important information into the DNA. <span class=\"grigio\">That is, genetic information.</span></p>\n<p>Your neurons are like the CPU of a computer, only that they are made of various chemicals instead of being primarily based on silicon. <span class=\"grigio\">Your neurons even have a <em>clock</em> and communicate between each others varying the so-called <em>membrane potential</em>, an electric signal. A peak in that potential triggers the release of neurotransmitters, chemicals such as dopamine, which carry information between neurons.</span></p>\n<p>After all, you're made by atoms. And atoms are not alive. Thus, where's life? Again, the answer is in the information.</p>\n<p>The material substrate (cells, neurons, organs such as the brain) is just a <span style=\"color: gold\">support</span> to the life. Life is in the information that your material substrate \"supports\". <span class=\"grigio\">In the same way that a platform (the body) supports a crystal vase (the life). If you remove the platform, the vase falls.</span></p>\n<p>Everything you perceive as \"life\", therefore, is an illusion of your Umwelt. Even the feeling of being in your body.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: red\"><strong>Veil of Life</strong>: <em>True life is outside of your Umwelt.</em></span></p>\n<p>And this is the last veil to remove.

SCP-042-IT is a sentient software with a limited ability[[footnote]]Given its nature, measuring the exact value has not been possible.[[/footnote]] to reality bend, which communicates with the device's user via the creation of a 42kB PDF or PNG file format, designed as SCP-042-IT-\u03c8. A human being who unlocks the device's screensaver[[footnote]]Every device affected by SCP-042-IT presents the same screensaver, even if before it did not have one.[[/footnote]] (see image) will be capable of reading the file in their native language. External observers will instead see a textless black screen. Every input other than those necessary to open the file will be ignored. Attempts to interface directly via software, with the operating system or to reformat it have proven to be ineffective.\n\n\n\nSCP-042-IT is capable of spreading to new devices in the same manner as non-anomalous computer viruses; with affected devices being designated as SCP-042-IT-2 instances. Such instances can be regularly destroyed by physically damaging the hardware. On the other hand, the laptop SCP-042-IT originated from (see Recovery Log), designed as SCP-042-IT-1, has proven to be resistant to every test performed so far[[footnote]]For further details, see the [[span class=\"hover\"]]042-IT/DMG-443[[span]][ERROR 404: FILE NOT FOUND][[/span]][[/span]] document.[[/footnote]] and has continued to function even after the removal of the battery.\n\n\n\nSCP-042-IT-\u03c8's effects on a human being depend from the memetic protection level possessed by the individual. In 78% of cases[[footnote]]For a complete case history, see the [[span class=\"hover\"]]042-IT/CompleteExperimentalLogs[[span]][ERROR 404: FILE NOT FOUND][[/span]][[/span]] document.[[/footnote]], affected subjects undergo a permanent reconfiguration of the entire nervous system, becoming SCP-042-IT-3 instances. After overcoming memetic defenses (both conscious and unconscious), SCP-042-IT is capable of \"reprogramming\" the brain, subjugating it to its own purposes. Analysis of the emission of [*http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/goc-supplemental-arad EVE particles][[footnote]]//Elan-Vital Energy//.

Macroscopic organs, such as eyes and hears, function through a multitude of microscopic units, a [[span style=\"color: gold\"]]sensor network[[/span]]: the neurosensory receptors. [[span class=\"grigio\"]]You have many of them: mechanoreceptors[[footnote]]Receptors which consent to perceive pressure.[[/footnote]], photoreceptors, nociceptors[[footnote]]Receptors of pain.[[/footnote]], thermoreceptors[[footnote]]Receptors of temperature.[[/footnote]], and so on.[[/span]]\n\n\n\nSensor damage causes a malfunction of the associated sense.

After consuming the individual, SCP-050-PT will lapse into a state of lethargy, growing rapidly in size by a measure of 1/100 in proportion to its own mass at the time of consumption, per hour, until the individual is fully digested. SCP-050-PT does not appear to possess any form of metabolism, and has not been observed losing bodily mass even after long periods without feeding. Nevertheless, SCP-050-PT possesses a non-anomalous sleeping pattern.</p>\n<p><strong>Containment:</strong> According to the witnesses present at the date of the containment of SCP-050-PT, the entity fell into the mineshaft where it currently resides (as of 12/7/19\u2588\u2588) while pursuing said witnesses: Raquel S\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and David M\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. The witnesses received amnestic treatment, and the current containment measures were implemented. Analysis of the bones and other vestiges found in the surrounding wilderness indicates that SCP-050-PT, or other individuals of the same species, must have inhabited the region for at least \u2588\u2588\u2588 years.</p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">+\u00a0Addendum\u00a0050-1:\u00a0Memorandum</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">-\u00a0[ACCESS\u00a0GRANTED]</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Truth be told, if SCP-050-PT hadn't fallen into that mineshaft, we would probably have had to send in Tau-5 to contain it. The thing seems to feel absolutely nothing, and from the look of his skin, that ugly motherfucker sustained several bullet wounds without dying. I would like to remind the individuals tasked with the patrols that, according to our most conservative estimates, if SCP-050-PT manages to get ahold of at least \u2588\u2588 more people, it'll gain enough mass to escape that shaft.</p>\n<p>What frightens the most is listening to it, while I patrol the entrance to the mine itself. Hearing those screams and lullabies, we managed to get a fine idea of how it thinks, and boy is he <em>pissed</em>. Moreover, he keeps muttering something about his \"pack\". Are those carcasses we found really just the product of his work alone?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> In 2/12/201\u2588, SCP-050-PT emitted a prolonged roar measuring up to 140db. Analysis of the audiovisual records of the park, revealed some background noise that, while initially believed to have been a by-product of the echo caused by the sound, were in fact emitted by [REDACTED]. Therefore, a rapid-access line shall be constructed near the exclusion zone, and necessary reinforcements will be transferred to the location until \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, effective immediately.

Only personnel with a Clearance Level of 3 or higher may enter the containment zones, and only for experimental purposes. Access is forbidden to any and all civilians under the pretext of conducting research on a population of marine mammals (depending on the place). A-Class (for witnesses) and/or B-Class amnestics (for victims) are to be administered where necessary. Photos and videos taken of SCP-054-FR must be destroyed, and an extensive campaign debunking them as hoaxes must be launched should any evidence be made public.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-054-FR is a phenomenon occurring in some waves off the western coasts of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and the Eastern coasts of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. It is characterized by the physical transformation of affected waves to resemble the jaws of a <em>Carcharodon carcharias</em>, commonly known as a Great White Shark. SCP-054-FR is capable of remaining unnoticed until it is almost too late to act. SCP-054-FR is capable of forming on waves at least 4m tall, but the maximum height of which it can reach is unknown. Affected waves are capable of rolling at 3 times the speed of non-affected waves if a non-aquatic animal or a human being is situated between SCP-054-FR and the closest coast.</p>\n<p>Appearances of SCP-054-FR grow considerably if the previously evoked individuals are situated at a distance of at least 250m from the coast, whether they are swimmers, divers, or aquatic vehicles of moderate size, with the most common victims having been surfers. Injuries caused by SCP-054-FR are similar to that which could be accomplished by a Great White Shark, but with pressure being directly proportional to the height of the affected wave. Injuries, lethal in 68% of cases, occur during the collapse of the wave over the victim. Reported injuries have been as simple as a removed limb to total disappearance of the victim. The only method of avoiding injury by SCP-054-FR is to dive under the wave before impact.</p>\n<p>SCP-054-FR appears only on the part of the wave to closest its victim. If more than one victim is available, SCP-054-FR will manifest at multiple points on the wave. SCP-054-FR will accelerate to an average of \u2588\u2588\u2588kph, with the highest reported speed being \u2588\u2588\u2588kph.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 054-A:</strong> A series of experiments discovered that releasing several litres of animal blood in the waters where SCP-054-FR is known to occur can cause its manifestation within two minutes. The instances of SCP-054-FR collapsed over the released blood. Further testing involving an equal amount human blood yielded a response in less than 60 seconds. Even small amounts of human blood have yielded faster reaction times than large quantities of animal blood.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 054-B:</strong> Unusually, several maritime birds were observed be consumed by SCP-054-FR when they moved in front of a wave taller than 4m. This was the first time SCP-054-FR has been observed attacking anything other than human prey.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 054-C:</strong> Observations have shown that wounded peoples are 4 times as likely to be victims of SCP-054-FR, with an instance manifesting in less than 60 seconds. Further testing revealed that remaining motionless reduced the likelihood of SCP-054-FR manifestations, as did slower body movements.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 054-D:</strong> All the attempts at damaging manifestations of SCP-054-FR via weapons fire have proven ineffective, with shots disappearing into the wall of water. Furthermore, attempts at concealing the subjects' smell have proven equally ineffective, with SCP-054-FR not appearing to be affected at all.</p>\n</div></body></html>", "raw_source": "\n\t[[module CSS]]\n\n.scp-image-block {\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0display: none;\n\n}\n\n[[/module]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-054-fr\">:scp-int:scp-054-fr</a>]]\n", "references": [], "scp": "SCP-054-FR", "scp_number": 54, "series": "international", "tags": ["_fr", "aquatic", "carnivorous", "euclid", "international", "scp", "self-replicating", "sentient"], "title": "SCP-054-FR", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-054-fr"}, "SCP-055-PT": {"created_at": "2019-10-31T14:04:00", "creator": "INT_Translator", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "INT_Translator", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/int-translator", "comment": "", "date": "2019-10-31T14:04:00"}, {"author": "INT_Translator", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/int-translator", "comment": "Added tags: adaptive, foundation-made, international, scp, thaumiel.

These AIs are stored bi-partially between the Unit's module and the Operative's Psionic Network; this bipartition allows the Operative to access the AI even when alien to its armour. This integration promotes personal contact between Operative and AI, allowing for the efficient premeditation and communication of actions through bounding.</p>\n<p>Each SCP-055-PT Unit is connected to a Psionic Network codified to its respective Operative. Psionic Networks are complex systems that store and transmit psionic information, based on an individual system similar to that of an intranet.</p>\n<div style=\"display: inline-block ; border : solid 1px #444444 ; background :#F5F5F5 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\">\n<p>Characteristically, psionic energy is a volatile substance with thaumaturgic applications, fundamental to psiokineticism. The nervous system Psions (individuals with psionic ability) is intrinsically capable of generating psionic energy through cognition and relevant stimuli, forming a Psionic Network. The energy is naturally produced by Psions but may be reproduced and manipulated artificially by hardware that emulates the workings of a Psionic Network.</p>\n<p>Due to the inherent adaptability of psiokineticism, the operation of psionics has a diversified range, similarly to traditional thaumaturgical abilities.

The relation of the object's complex systems with subjacent and associated projects must be dissimulated through internal disinformation protocols.\n\n\n\nSCP-055-PT Units and Operatives are currently contained in Site PT4, in the maximum-security sectors of the Department of Thaumaturgy, in the Thaumaturgical Office-Works, and in the Specialised Lodgings, respectively, under the protection and scrutiny of the Prometheus Protocol, enforced by the Stationary Task-Force PT1-\u03c8. Any exceptions to the standard operations must be protocoled by a liable administrative officer from the relevant team in order to exceptionate the effect of the Protocol's protective directives.\n\n\n\nSCP-055-PT Units must not be constructed without direct ordinations issued by the Lusophone Directorial Board. Existing SCP-055-PT Units must be maintained inert in the Stasis Vaults whilst not deployed in the programmed operations conforming to the standard chronogram or relevant exceptional/emergency protocols. Additional components related to the maintenance, storage, and study of the systems must be maintained in the properly scrutinised inventory and stored according to the directives of the Prometheus Protocol.\n\n\n\nThe documents relative to the sub-project ATACA -- Psion Operative establishes directives for the training and the eligibility of the Operatives, specifying significant qualifications associated to the character, psychological profile, loyalty, experience, psychophysical qualities and exceptional acuity/ability for dealing with psionic-thaumaturgic fields. Operatives are liable to be subjected to weekly psychophysical evaluations, and in the case of incompatibility, the effect of conditioning acts in accordance with the documented directives.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-055-PT is a system projected as a matrix in the form of highly-adaptive personal body armours designed to enhance the psychophysical performance of its user, essentially through the application of psionic-thaumaturgic engineering.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe components comprising SCP-055-PT are primarily based on the technology developed through [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-007-int the Oneiric Project], and singularised in a system completely energised by a nuclear-thaumaturgic nucleus. Oneiricweave[[footnote]]An artificial, intelligent material that is highly transmutable through processes of adaptive stimuli.[[/footnote]] is manipulated and programmed into components that are sensitive to the reception and operation of psionics and thaumaturgy, then integrated into a network codified to a specific Operative and their SCP-055-PT Unit.\n\n\n\nThese components are pre-programmed with standard resilience towards the stimuli from biological, chemical, nuclear, thaumartugic, psionic, memetic, ontokinetic, and physical agents; these resiliences are complemented by the autonomous adaptive capability possessed by the Oneiricweave reaction to stress.\n\n\n\nSCP-055-PT Units are equipped with a supporting Individual Artificial Intelligence Module based in the breakthroughs occurred during [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-007-int Project Mel] and Project Chamomile. These modules comprise artificial constructs that emulate human intelligence; that of an advanced computational unity synthetically.\n\n\n\nThe integrated artificial intelligence operates as an extension of the Operative, supporting activities through the micro and macro management of systems. These AIs are stored bi-partially between the Unit's module and the Operative's Psionic Network; this bipartition allows the Operative to access the AI even when alien to its armour. This integration promotes personal contact between Operative and AI, allowing for the efficient premeditation and communication of actions through bounding.\n\n\n\nEach SCP-055-PT Unit is connected to a Psionic Network codified to its respective Operative. Psionic\u00a0\u00a0Networks are complex systems that store and transmit psionic information, based on an individual system similar to that of an intranet. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block ; border : solid 1px #444444 ; background :#F5F5F5 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\n\n\n\nCharacteristically, psionic energy is a volatile substance with thaumaturgic applications, fundamental to psiokineticism. The nervous system Psions (individuals with psionic ability) is intrinsically capable of generating psionic energy through cognition and relevant stimuli, forming a Psionic Network. The energy is naturally produced by Psions but may be reproduced and manipulated artificially by hardware that emulates the workings of a Psionic Network.\n\n\n\nDue to the inherent adaptability of psiokineticism, the operation of psionics has a diversified range, similarly to traditional thaumaturgical abilities. Such as manipulatory manifestations (manipulating the physical characteristics and qualities of psionic energy), remote manipulations, ontokinetic manipulations (manifestation of psionic energy to \"bend\" the immediate reality through materialisation or transmutation of substance). \n\n\n\nMoreover, extrasensory perceptions, as per the example of clairsentience (the ability to process factual specific information in the form of experimental or Qualia[[footnote]]Individual instances of conscient subjective experience that are ineffable, intrinsic, personal and only directly applicable to conscience[[/footnote]] experience may be achieved through Psionics.\n\n\n\nTelepathy is a complex field to be characterised. It is, usually, associated with the capability for communication through an anomalous cognitive mean within a systemic environment. Hence, my interpretation is that Telepathy is a type of engineering that manages and administrates psionic information.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n//-- Professor Cinthia Rosabela, Department of Theoretical Thaumaturgics and Associated Research and Application.//\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n**Body Armour:** A segmented set comprised of multiple levels of elastic plates and alloys made of hybrid nanofibres over an exoskeleton. These layers are maintained under compression to enhance the resistance thereof against kinetic penetrators. \n\n\n\nThis involucrum permeates the subjacent components comprehending SCP-055-PT's system. Additionally, thin layers of graphite are utilised for the absorption of kinetic energy created by impacts or vibrations. Once worn, the armour will be hermetically sealed by pressurised seals, and filtered by specialised sub-systems. \n\n\n\n**Helmet:** Possibilitates for the complete neurological integration of the Unit's Individual Module, allowing total access for the management of the relevant control, interface, informational, sensorial, and communication systems present in the armour.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Thaumaturgic Fusion Reactor:** Inert in the dorsal spine of the body armour. Protected by a specialised encasing, these reactors generate and store psionic-thaumaturgic energy to supply a Unit's systems with energy.\n\n\n\n**Inner Suit:** An elastic bodysuit comprised of Oneiricweave that emulates optical nanofibres. Used for the efficient transportation of energy and information within the Unit-Operative macro, especially to enhance the operation of the sensorial systems and psionic-thaumaturgic abilities, virtually integrating the two parties synaptically and cognitively.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis enhancement occurs through the interaction with the Psionic Amplifiers segmented throughout its surface, amplifying the input and output of psionic energy, improving psychophysical capabilities in a factor of five. \n\n\n\n**Psionic Amplifiers:** Based on the technology developed by the breakthroughs of [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-004-int Project Hexenherz], these crystalline micro-nuclei are integrated directly into the Inner Suit, superconducting the inputted energy through the nanofibres.\n\n\n\n**Hecate's Anchor:** Based on the design and functionality of a Scranton Reality Anchor, this experimental component is a minute device that isolates the Unit and Operative within a thaumaturgic field that stabilises the immediate reality against ontokinetic stress.\n\n\n\n**Stasis Shield:** A compact system that generates an integral stasis vault[[footnote]]A high-security forcefield that engineers energy to suspend animation within an area.[[/footnote]] to guarantee the survival of the Unit and Operative in case of a catastrophic failure that compromises the integrity of SCP-055-PT. During the activation, all the energy generated by the Reactor will be destined for the maintenance of the vault. \n\n\n\n**Disruption Psi-Armaments:**\u00a0\u00a0These artefacts incorporate paratechnology in the form of a portable armament; each integrated with its own minute Reactor and Amplifiers that can be connected to SCP-055-PT, permitting extensive manipulation as an extension thereof. \n\n\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block ; border : solid 1px #444444 ; background :#F5F5F5 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\n\n\n\nInspired by ambitious designs and prototypes of magnetic weapons developed by the Brazilian Superintendence for the Paranormal, this hybrid equipment integrates concepts from //Directed Energy Weapons// and //Pulsed Energy Projectiles// with anomalous technologies in order to create a product with extremely high performance.\n\n\n\n//Directed Energy Weapons//, are armaments capable of emitting highly-focused energy electromagnetically.

I'll tell you everything.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>As you already know, the modern man navigates amongst countless websites and hyperlinks. Let's see; it was\u2026 2006 or some time near that. Oliver Lloyd, Oscar Stephan and Lex McNeill, MIT's three aspiring prodigies, constructed a 3-D model of cyberspace, similar to constructing a giant universe. While doing so, they discovered a pattern rather\u2026 peculiar, a pattern about the correlation of the real world and the messages/comments shared online.</p>\n<p>I assume you're uninterested after seeing your fair share of all sorts of hideous SCP instances, saying, \"What is this? Another one of those cyber-based reality-altering SCPs?\" I understand. I was like that. That's precisely why I am having such a hassle.</p>\n<p>Anyways, the McNeil guy started an independent analysis of that pattern. The results were horrifying. The apparent patterns alone counted up to the thousands. When 10% of the 3D network model was complete, McNeil checked the web pages that fit his \"pattern\". It looked like\u2026 McNeil originally named it \"the Treeroot effect\", from its name.</p>\n<p>The \"Treeroot\" was rendering the world worse, more serious. Not all was known, but there was a statistically noticeable correlation. When the Treeroot reached a secret community of lowlives, sexual violence arrest rates of that country skyrocketed starting from the next month. When it reached the website for an environmental protection group, the rainforest of Malaysia started to disappear. McNeil felt something strange, but he didn't alert his colleagues just yet. He wasn't sure about the correlation just yet.</p>\n<p>Then, one day, post-grad student and Foundation agent Mikhail Sergeyevich Fyodorov caught wind of the news. After meeting with McNeil, the two realised that the \"Treeroot\" was hiding the severity of the situation. To an aspiring biologist's eyes, the phenomenon looked like an amoeba or macrophage spreading about. He felt the need to make a model of this \"Treeroot\", no, \"Amoeba\" spreading. Mikhail instantly invited Mcneil and his friends to the Foundation.</p>\n<p>I rambled on for too long. <em>(The response team would most likely be yawning behind you. Isn't that strange? Actually, they are my direct inferiors. Keep calm and carry on.)</em> This horrible amoeba, no, cybernetic macrophage reaches its appendages to random websites. When someone sees a specific scroll of a website 'contaminated' by SCP-056-KO, it leeches on their imagination and (possibly) strengthens itself, along with causing whatever it is written on the real world, to some extent. When it became clear that SCP-056-KO was behind multiple international events, it was given the class Euclid.</p>\n<p>Now, you will realise, at least a bit, why I told you so desperately not to read the page. At first, the Foundation monitored creepypasta sites, SF author sites, horror novel contests, literature wikis, and other literature related websites of schools or communities, shuddering at the fact that whenever the root reaches its hands on such pages, there is one more SCP that the Foundation needs to secure.

The latest tests done on D-Class with anterograde amnesia also had negative results.</em> - Korea SCiPNET Database Manager (Deputy)</p>\n<p><strong>[ Archived Containment Protocols ]</strong></p>\n<p>A list of web pages affected by SCP-056-KO is kept to monitor their view count and accessing IP address. Foundation personnel are to disguise as college student conducting surveys and ask civilians who read the website about what possible dangers they can imagine. A rescue team is sent to the predicted location of disaster to minimise casualties. The page is to be shut down from the source level immediately after confirmation. When needed, collaboration with local culture or communication agencies can be executed.</p>\n<p>To minimise its exposure to civilians and better understand SCP-056-KO's physiology and build a model of its proliferation of influence, Mobile Task Force Yota-100 \"A better world\" is organised. MTF Yota-100 is composed of programmers and hackers dedicated to fight against SCP-056-KO. The unit explores attack routes by any means possible for potentially dangerous expansion of influence. In addition, the unit is to proceed with the establishment of cybernetic models and big data related to the activities of SCP-056-KO.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-056-KO is an entity believed to exist in cyberspace, which resembles an amoeba when visualised as a three-dimensional network of web pages and hyperlinks.</p>\n<p>Currently, there are thousands of confirmed web pages affected by SCP-056-KO, and the number of people exposed to SCP-056-KO is unknown. However, there is an optimistic theory that there are people unaffected by the anomaly in certain conditions. Animal testing did not yield any data, at least from species other than human.</p>\n<p>SCP-056-KO spreads its influence on a specific section of a webpage to \"infect\" it. People visually coming in contact with the page share their cognitive system with SCP-056-KO by means unknown, while copying of extracting creations of the viewer's imagination. Richer imaginations lead to more absorption, and more extreme imaginations cause more dangerous ideas to be absorbed. <em>(This is an excerpt from Researcher Lex McNeill's thesis. However, the thesis is currently under peer review.)</em></p>\n<p>SCP-056-KO is thought to have the ability to partially realise what imagination it absorbed. Thanks to prior research, links between the entity and individual cases of large-scale accidents, natural disasters and sensational events have been confirmed, but how much influence the entity has on mundane crimes or usual social problems is unclear.</p>\n<p>The most widely accepted theory is that the entity has a physical form; some researchers even claim that the entity is a hivemind moving to fit a specific purpose. On the other hand, some claim that it is merely a series of events, and it is unnecessary to explain it as an entity, but rather it is a pattern misrecognised.</p>\n<p><strong>[ Additional Content of SCiPNET Security Breach ]</strong></p>\n<p>How SCP-056-KO noticed SCiPNET and disrupted the security system is disputed. Researcher McNeil commented on this matter:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u2026My main concern is the possibility that someone imagined a fictional organisation like the Foundation, and the database storing it was attacked. SCP-056-KO grasped their image, used it to bypass all security measures, leaping straight onto our database. If we succeed in explaining the mechanism\u2026 I think we would have clues to how SCP-056-KO builds its influence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As the SCiPNET security breach incident poses a significant threat to the entity's containment, the proposal to pinpoint the Foundation database, the SCiPNET itself as the centre of containment, has been accepted. As such, SCP-056-KO was re-classified to Keter. A scenario in which the Foundation's various censorship activities amplifies the imagination of personnel, ultimately leading to the end of the world due to SCP-056-KO's activities, has been proposed.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\"Operation Apoptosis\" Report</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><sub>2008.11.14.</sub><br/>\n<sub>MTF Yota-100 \"A better world\"</sub></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size:130%;\"><strong>Operation Apoptosis</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>1st Operation Report: PLAN A</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Expose specially designated personnel to SCP-056-KO, weakening its catastrophic anomaly to the level of Safe class entities or Anomalous Objects.</p>\n<p><strong>Contents:</strong> A specially picked D-Class personnel was trained for a year, boosting his imagination and forcing him to imagine a preset scenario compulsively. Conditioning of induced Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder was possible. The preset scenario included events such as SCP-056-KO's expansion stopping, its departure from SCiPNET, complete management of previously affected websites by the Foundation, and Foundation researchers throwing an outdoor party with chants of joy. D-10054 successfully finished the one-year-long training. He then proceeded to obsessively and compulsively imagine the scenario, dosed with high amounts of tranquilising agents and other neuroactive drugs.</p>\n<p><strong>Results:</strong> D-10054 was successfully exposed to SCP-056-KO's SiPNET page. However, the expected result did not happen. After a week of laborious search, the Foundation found out that A\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 A\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, who detained and violently raped his younger cousin for three months, was arrested by the local law enforcement. The victim was stoned to death by her relatives as honour killing. Research of D-10054's past actions revealed that D-10054, imprisoned initially as a political prisoner, exerted sexual desires towards his younger cousin sister. The relevance between the incident and this operation is disputed. There is a possibility that the scenario D-10054 \"thought of in the past\" might have been true.</p>\n<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Regardless of this operation's aftermath, the first operation did not bear any expected results.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>2nd Operation Report: PLAN B</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Expose specially designated personnel to SCP-056-KO, weakening its catastrophic anomaly to the level of Safe class entities or Anomalous Objects.</p>\n<p><strong>Contents:</strong> Nine children (age 4 to 6, eight times more than needed) of Foundation employees with security rank two or lower were taken without the parents' consent. The Foundation Cognitive Development Research Facility interviewed them, ordered them by vividness of imagination, and took the first. The child is then exposed to a similar scenario to PLAN A, in which SCP-056-KO was explained as comical and childish as possible. Inducing mental or emotional trauma to aid the process was unnecessary, but stabilisers could have been administered within an acceptable range of side effects when needed.</p>\n<p><strong>Results:</strong> Loss of classified information assets amounting over [DATA EXPUNGED] and 36 anomalous objects. No expected results reported in any way.</p>\n<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The execution of \"PLAN B\" caused a tremendous loss of Foundation assets. Re-discussing any severe damage \"it\" caused in its rampage is deemed unnecessary. It was hilarious to see it sliding down a rainbow to Site-122 parking lot and eat cotton candy, but I would like to emphasise the comedy ended there. Plan Apoptosis failed.

The structure hosts four pharmacies, thirty-five medical offices, five kitchens, one storage facility, twenty-five office rooms, and eight laboratories; the veracity of whether these facilities have been used to the performance of the activities they are destined for is inconclusive, although it is theorized that these rooms have been used for the conduction of experiments relating to [DATA EXPUNGED]. Of note, at the external gardens, there is a three-meter wall with a six-meter plat in which groups of six <em>Prunus dulcis</em> (almond trees) are displaced in segments of three, blossoming independent of the current season.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>A significant amount of the installation's internal walls are covered by a rugous material analogous to a type of concrete; an equally relevant amount of surfaces are drawn with symbols of unknown exordium, though similar to catalogued arcane engravings, due to its innumerable idiosyncrasies. In the vicinities in which experiments were conducted, it is possible to observe a series of codes and names, cross-referencing one another and the engravings. These epithets are written in English, thus alluding to the possibility that SCP-057-PT may have been present in English-speaking countries.</p>\n<p>The location does not display anomalies when visualised externally.

All civilians attempting to enter the internal area of SCP-057-PT must be extracted from the nearby vicinity. If any type of counter-assertion is demonstrated, the individual must be treated with Class-B amnestics. SCP-057-PT's provisional containment measures involve the installation of wall-cladding material thoroughly circulating the edifice, blocking any unauthorized individuals whilst protecting the integrity of the structure. The installation is currently located in a forest environment of the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina. Although the edifice periodically moves in between locations, it has already been spotted by agents in three different states.\n\n\n\nThe entrance preceding the installations must be guarded by two agents equipped with medium-to-heavy military firearms. The same equipment must be provided to the agents securing the external perimeter, which must be guarded by seven agents. A state of high-alert must be maintained even throughout the night when the peculiarities pertaining to the installation become temporarily non-existent.\n\n\n\nThe reception area of the installation must be guarded by seven security agents armed with pistols \u2014 who are required to attend to the instances documented in __**Document-057AB**__. Every and any change that may happen in the secured areas must be communicated immediately upon notice; such as attacks or affronting changes in the behaviour of the instances.\n\n\n\n------\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ DOCUMENT-057-AA\" hide=\"- Close.\"]]\n\n> Following the containment breach in which a Class-D subject abandoned its position as an observer from the gates of the institution, and entered it, allegedly \"feeling really cold\", it has been noted that SCP-057-PT-1 and SCP-057-PT-2, although present in the vespertine period, had disappeared. This pattern of disappearances and reappearances during the night-period has been confirmed as one of the characteristics of the anomaly.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ DOCUMENT-057-AB\" hide=\"- Close.\"]]\n\n> The primary instances, SCP-057-PT-1 and SCP-057-PT-2, have demonstrated unstable personalities, vehemently questioning the guards about the reason why they are in the institution, and periodically becoming irritated with the presence thereof. Any acts with affronting objectives must be dealt with by neutralising or terminating the relevant instances. Low-calibre projectiles have managed to quickly dispatch these instances due to their particular physical weakness.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n------\n\n**Description:** SCP-057-PT is characterised as a medical institution built in the year of 194\u2588, with a structure fit to about three hundred and forty singular hospital beds. The structure hosts four pharmacies, thirty-five medical offices, five kitchens, one storage facility, twenty-five office rooms, and eight laboratories; the veracity of whether these facilities have been used to the performance of the activities they are destined for is inconclusive, although it is theorized that these rooms have been used for the conduction of experiments relating to [DATA EXPUNGED]. Of note, at the external gardens, there is a three-meter wall with a six-meter plat in which groups of six //Prunus dulcis// (almond trees) are displaced in segments of three, blossoming independent of the current season.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nA significant amount of the installation's internal walls are covered by a rugous material analogous to a type of concrete; an equally relevant amount of surfaces are drawn with symbols of unknown exordium, though similar to catalogued arcane engravings, due to its innumerable idiosyncrasies. In the vicinities in which experiments were conducted, it is possible to observe a series of codes and names, cross-referencing one another and the engravings. These epithets are written in English, thus alluding to the possibility that SCP-057-PT may have been present in English-speaking countries.\n\n\n\nThe location does not display anomalies when visualised externally. Nevertheless, commencing the vespertine period, it is possible to notice the apparition of two sapient instances: SCP-057-PT-1 -- a female entity taking on the role of a nurse; SCP-057-PT-2 -- a male entity taking on the role of a scientist or, periodically, a proper medical doctor.\n\n\n\nAfter this event, every individual with any type of ailment[[footnote]]Exceptionally concussions, dilaceration or bruises.[[/footnote]] -- physical or psychological -- within a seven meter radius in the instances's line of sight will be transported to an illuminated room. In that room, the individual will be connected to a machine of unprecedented origin that will unravel the personality and memories of the subject, analysing and judging its previous actions.\n\n\n\nIf the subject has displayed an adequate and amicable relationship with the individuals that have been present in its life, it will be healed from all its ailments, including terminal diseases; these subjects do not feel discomfort or fear when whilst undergoing the probing events, considering the primary instances and the environment as \"pleasant\". Though, if the subject has displayed an inadequate and inimical relationship towards the individuals relevant to his life, it will experience great discomfort and aversion to both instances and the environment, undergoing a complete thaumaturgic-transmutative process that will transform the subject into one of the following secondary instances:\n\n\n\n**SCP-057-PT-3:** Is characterised as a powerful light with a silver triangle in its centre, releasing rays of illuminating light with an intensity of one-hundred-thousand lumens. Anyone standing within a ten meter radius of the object is affected with extreme ocular discomfort (even whilst not maintaining visual contact), followed by temporary or permanent blindness.\n\n\n\nAny exemplary of this instance must be dispatched by the STF-PT57-\u03b1, utilising the rapid-response high-opacity visual equipment at their disposal.\n\n\n\n**SCP-057-PT-4:** Is characterised as a replica of the microorganism //Streptococcos pneumoniae// with thirty centimetres of height by twenty centimetres of width, and exactly one kilogram of weight. If a subject fixates its gaze or stands in the same unobstructed environment as SCP-057-PT-4, the subject will suddenly be whelmed by asphyxia and incessant, compulsory coughing, dying due to lung obstruction three minutes after the manifestation of the symptoms.\n\n\n\nThe organism is extremely fragile against excessive heat; for that reason, the STF-P1-\u03b1 has been geared with controlled incendiary rapid-response equipment for deployment in case that terminating the instances with projectiles is not plausible.\n\n\n\n------\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ A recovered missive from SCP-057-PT-2\" hide=\"- Close.\"]]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0A recovered missive from SCP-057-PT-2.\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0Mary,\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0I have never felt the most profound and forlorn corners of my mind so altercated in such a manner as they are right now. Thousands of soldiers were harmed, and now it is up to us to make the choice of who we will tender.

After entering the location, the subject was accompanied by two agents to the vicinity where the primary instances had been manifested. After entering the radius of effect, the subject was materialised inside the room equipped with the anomalous machinery.\n\n\n\n> * **Results:** The individual was completely healed from their brain tumor. A battery of radiographic tests confirmed the circumstances. Subject ministered with 3 dosages of Class-B amnestics, and put into observation for three continuous days.\n\n\n\n> * A subject with renal insufficiency was sent to the institution; given the previous test, it was expected that the subject would be healed from its affectation. After being conducted to the radius of effect, the instances dematerialised with it. Nearby guards allegedly heard acutely uncomfortable vocalizations echoing throughout the facility.\n\n\n\n> * **Results:** The experiment succeeded with the creation of an SCP-057-PT-3 instance. The instance was terminated using the standard procedures after the elaboration thereof through the analysis of the instance's qualities.\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ ARCHIVE-057-01\u03b1\" hide=\"- Close.\"]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border-radius: 10px; border:dashed 1px #444444; background:#F5F5F5; float:top; width:96.5%; padding:10px\"]]\n\n\n\nRecovered documents:\n\n\n\n**Fragment of Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's declaration:**\n\n\n\nI don't know if this should be happening, dear workers, gears that turn this hospital.\n\nBut the circumstances are proving quite unfavourable to us.

The two keys of the containment locker are currently in possession of Dr. Baum, the current Chief of Security of Sector 11. Use of SCP-066-DE requires permission from Dr. Baum and may only take place in a testing chamber of safety class ER-2.-- Following Incident #066-DE-I1, the secure containment procedures have been changed as follows: SCP-066-DE is to be contained within a quadruple-locked Class S4-safe, upon a pedestal 1 m in height, in a 3\u00d73\u00d73 m Standard Containment Chamber. The safe is to always be in view of surveillance cameras from all angles. Sensors will recognize whether or not the safe has been opened by all four keys simultaneously. Failing to do so will result in SCP-066-DE being destroyed by a thermite charge. Personnel who attempt to gain unauthorized access to the containment chamber or to the safe are to be questioned, amnesticized, and either reclassified as D-Class personnel or terminated. Currently, any use of SCP-066-DE is prohibited. In the event that its use is allowed at a later time, it must take place in the dedicated Class EDR-4 test chamber attached to the containment chamber.\n\n\n\nShould SCP-066-DE-1, SCP-066-DE-2, or anything similar manifest, the containment breach alarm is to be set off, the whole facility is to be put on lock down, and containment protocol \ud835\udd10\ud835\udd1e\ud835\udd24\ud835\udd32\ud835\udd30 shall be executed.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-066-DE is a book of approximately 300 pages titled \"Das kleine Zauberbuch - F\u00fcr Studenten und Absolventen der Magierakademie zu \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\"[[footnote]]German for: \"The Little Spellbook - For Students and Graduates of the Mages Academy of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\"[[/footnote]] It is composed of a red hardcover binding, an ISBN number on its back cover, and is written in numerous Fraktur, Antiqua and Symbol fonts, all of which are freely available on the Internet. It contains instructions for 115 spells, divided into the chapters of Battle Magic, Analysis, Healing, Protection, General Spells, Manipulation and Evocation, and an addendum with several runes, esoteric and alchemical symbols. The foreword contains a list of spells which \"are taught at some other institutes\" but are \"not taught at ours and are not explained in this book\", due to involving e.g. necromancy, the summoning of demons, or blood magic.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> name=http://scp-wiki-de.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-066-de/ZauberbuchAufgeschlagen.jpg|caption=Spell: \"Fire-Shield\"]]\n\n\n\nWhen a spell is performed exactly as described in the book, the effects will manifest within realty; a list of tested spells can be found in [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/versuchsprotokoll-066-de-p1 Experiment log #066-DE-P1]. During casting, the conjurer has to be close to the book (circa 0.5 m, varying from person to person). Every spell has a cost, which is measured in the unspecified unit \"T\", and a level (Apprentice, Adept, Master, Grandmaster). Test subjects are only able to cast spells with low costs in the beginning. In case an inexperienced subject tries to cast a high cost spell, this may result in adverse effects, ranging from vertigo and/or nausea to death. With greater experience, spells of higher cost can be cast. Some spells contain warning notices about possible imponderables or instructions for members of the \"Mages Academy of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\", such as an obligation to report any failed restorations of vampires and werewolves to the Principal's office.\n\n\n\n[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/protokoll-066-de-i1 Incident log #066-DE-I1 (Security clearance level 3/066-DE required)]\n\n\n\n**Addendum:**\n\nSCP-066-DE was found near the remnants of an unidentifiable person, cause of death seemingly being implosion. The ISBN-number lead to a print-on-demand service in Germany, in whose database the entire order had been irrecoverably deleted.\n\n\n\nThe existence of a city or region named \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is unknown. There is no information about a group called the \"Mages Academy of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\". Their inclusion into the Groups of Interest list is suspended until their existence can be proven.\n\n\n\n**Note:**\n\n> Not only was this the most serious breach in this facility ever, but it could and should have been avoided.

The containment chamber itself must have soundproof walls. It is prohibited to place objects inside SCP-069-UA, to expose it to any sort of powerful sounds or musical melodies and to block the ability of the object to move, except during authorized testing. Experiments that involve placing SCP-069-UA in closed spaces less than 2 x 2 x 2 meters in size are prohibited.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-069-UA is a charcoal smoothing-iron, made of cast iron and weighing exactly 5.1\u00a0kg. The left side of the iron bears the inscription \"\u0414\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0432\u044b\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0430 1933\"<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> as well as the State Emblem of the Soviet Union. The iron itself was likely made at the time specified on the object- the anomalous properties were apparently acquired at a later date.</p>\n<p>Every day at 5:00 PM an event designated AEX-069 occurs. At the start of the event, SCP-069-UA rises above the ground to a height of 50 to 250\u00a0cm. Within the next four (4) minutes, the object flies around the area along a unique trajectory. Should event AEX-069 occur while SCP-069-UA is located indoors, it is to remain inside of the area. In case that adjacent rooms are available, the object can travel through up to 25 rooms on its path.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that the object counteracts attempts to disrupt its motion during AEX-069. Experiments have shown that, if at the beginning of AEX-069 the object was fastened to something (for example, with a chain), then, at the onset of the event, SCP-069-UA makes sharp moves that break the fixtures (in case of a chain, it tears a link apart). Fixtures of any strength tested so far were successfully broken. This event also occurs when SCP-069-UA attempts to avoid obstacles. For example, during one experiment, thirty 1 x 2\u00a0m sheets of glass were placed in SCP-069-UA's containment chamber. During the next AEX-069 event, the object did not collide with any of the glass sheets.</p>\n<p>At the start of every AEX-069 event, SCP-069-UA emits a melody, referred to as SCP-069-M-UA. Usually, SCP-069-M-UA consists of the National Anthem of the Soviet Union; this version of SCP-069-M-UA is referred to as SCP-069-M1-UA. Also, if SCP-069-UA contains charcoal (or another flammable material) at the onset of AEX-069, said material will burn completely over the course of the event, emitting the expected amount of heat for the given material. Charcoal and many other substances that can be considered fuel burn down completely, without any ash or residue. In the case that SCP-069-UA is filled with non-combustive material, results may vary greatly, though they depend on material's properties.</p>\n<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> The object was discovered in a warehouse of an abandoned factory in the Donetsk region of Ukraine, [REDACTED], which has been closed since 1991. According to further investigations, a certain [REDACTED], formerly a category 5 welder<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup>, later transferred to work as a guard at the warehouse for health reasons, had disappeared shortly before the factory was shut down.

Some time later MTF \"Gossip Writers\" found a story about a \"possessed\" iron on http://\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a 'creepypasta' site. The story had several photos attached, three (3) of which depicted SCP-069-UA floating, and a video of AEX-069 that was shot using a cell phone. Initial analysis of the photos deemed them most likely genuine. One of the eyewitnesses also testified that he broke his hand when he tried to grab SCP-069-UA while it was in the air. After that, the object was successfully recovered by Foundation agents, and all eyewitnesses were treated with amnestics. A cover story, describing the \"flying iron\" as fiction, was posted on the site.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Personnel with clearance 2/069 and above are allowed to read Document E2-069 - partial experiment logs:</p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">+\u00a0Open\u00a0file\u00a0E2-069.html</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">-\u00a0Close\u00a0file\u00a0E2-069.html</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Experiment \u2116:</strong><br/>\n<strong>Date:</strong><br/>\n<strong>Procedure:</strong><br/>\n<strong>Result:</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Experiment \u2116:</strong> E069-A\u2588<br/>\n<strong>Date:</strong> 1/06/2011<br/>\n<strong>Procedure:</strong> Playing the national anthem of Soviet Union during an AEX-069 event.<br/>\n<strong>Result:</strong> The national anthem was turned on, SCP-069-UA stopped emitting SCP-069-M1-UA for 1.5 seconds and then resumed.

The containment chamber itself must have soundproof walls. It is prohibited to place objects inside SCP-069-UA, to expose it to any sort of powerful sounds or musical melodies and to block the ability of the object to move, except during authorized testing. Experiments that involve placing SCP-069-UA in closed spaces less than 2 x 2 x 2 meters in size are prohibited.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-069-UA is a charcoal smoothing-iron, made of cast iron and weighing exactly 5.1 kg. The left side of the iron bears the inscription \"\u0414\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0432\u044b\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0430 1933\"[[footnote]]Translation: Manufactured in 1933[[/footnote]] as well as the State Emblem of the Soviet Union. The iron itself was likely made at the time specified on the object- the anomalous properties were apparently acquired at a later date.\n\n\n\nEvery day at 5:00 PM an event designated AEX-069 occurs. At the start of the event, SCP-069-UA rises above the ground to a height of 50 to 250 cm. Within the next four (4) minutes, the object flies around the area along a unique trajectory. Should event AEX-069 occur while SCP-069-UA is located indoors, it is to remain inside of the area. In case that adjacent rooms are available, the object can travel through up to 25 rooms on its path.\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that the object counteracts attempts to disrupt its motion during AEX-069. Experiments have shown that, if at the beginning of AEX-069 the object was fastened to something (for example, with a chain), then, at the onset of the event, SCP-069-UA makes sharp moves that break the fixtures (in case of a chain, it tears a link apart). Fixtures of any strength tested so far were successfully broken. This event also occurs when SCP-069-UA attempts to avoid obstacles. For example, during one experiment, thirty 1 x 2 m sheets of glass were placed in SCP-069-UA's containment chamber. During the next AEX-069 event, the object did not collide with any of the glass sheets.\n\n\n\nAt the start of every AEX-069 event, SCP-069-UA emits a melody, referred to as SCP-069-M-UA. Usually, SCP-069-M-UA consists of the National Anthem of the Soviet Union; this version of SCP-069-M-UA is referred to as SCP-069-M1-UA. Also, if SCP-069-UA contains charcoal (or another flammable material) at the onset of AEX-069, said material will burn completely over the course of the event, emitting the expected amount of heat for the given material. Charcoal and many other substances that can be considered fuel burn down completely, without any ash or residue. In the case that SCP-069-UA is filled with non-combustive material, results may vary greatly, though they depend on material's properties.\n\n\n\n**Discovery:** The object was discovered in a warehouse of an abandoned factory in the Donetsk region of Ukraine, [REDACTED], which has been closed since 1991. According to further investigations, a certain [REDACTED], formerly a category 5 welder[[footnote]]Ex-USSR welder grading system. Grade 1 is the least qualified, doing the simplest things and assisting more experienced professionals. Grade 6 is the most qualified, authorized for pipeline welding and having their own workman's mark.[[/footnote]], later transferred to work as a guard at the warehouse for health reasons, had disappeared shortly before the factory was shut down. The subject was also an active member of a local CPSU[[footnote]]Communist Party of the Soviet Union[[/footnote]] cell. Some time later MTF \"Gossip Writers\" found a story about a \"possessed\" iron on http://\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a 'creepypasta' site. The story had several photos attached, three (3) of which depicted SCP-069-UA floating, and a video of AEX-069 that was shot using a cell phone. Initial analysis of the photos deemed them most likely genuine. One of the eyewitnesses also testified that he broke his hand when he tried to grab SCP-069-UA while it was in the air. After that, the object was successfully recovered by Foundation agents, and all eyewitnesses were treated with amnestics. A cover story, describing the \"flying iron\" as fiction, was posted on the site.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\nPersonnel with clearance 2/069 and above are allowed to read Document E2-069 - partial experiment logs:\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Open file E2-069.html\" hide=\"- Close file E2-069.html\" hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n\n\n\n> **Experiment \u2116:**\n\n> **Date:**\n\n> **Procedure:**\n\n> **Result:**\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n> **Experiment \u2116:** E069-A\u2588\n\n> **Date:** 1/06/2011\n\n> **Procedure:** Playing the national anthem of Soviet Union during an AEX-069 event.\n\n> **Result:** The national anthem was turned on, SCP-069-UA stopped emitting SCP-069-M1-UA for 1.5 seconds and then resumed. Event AEX-069 lasted for 8 minutes, with SCP-069-M1-UA harmonizing with the rhythm of the audio recording.\n\n\n\n> **Experiment \u2116:**\u00a0\u00a0E069-A\u2588\n\n> **Date:** 5/07/2011 - 30/07/2011\n\n> **Procedure:** Playing the song \"Katusha\" every time an event AEX-069 occurred.\n\n> **Result:** When the record started playing, SCP-069-UA stopped emitting SCP-069-M1-UA. After 9/07/2011 it was noted that SCP-069-UA was trying to mimic the song. Every next day the amount and quality of the sounds emitted by SCP-069-UA increased, until on 30/07/2011, when it played the melody of the song \"Katusha\" in its entirety. This melody, played by the object, was designated as SCP-069-M2-UA. On subsequent days the object resumed emitting SCP-069-M1-UA, but reproducing of SCP-069-M2-UA during an AEX-069 event was observed \u2588\u2588 more times.\n\n\n\n> **Experiment \u2116:** E069-A\u2588\n\n> **Date:** 7/08/2011\n\n> **Procedure:** Playing //Yesterday// by The Beatles during an AEX-069 event.\n\n> **Result:** When the record started playing, SCP-069-UA stopped emitting SCP-069-M1-UA for 8 seconds. After this SCP-069-UA resumed emitting SCP-069-M1-UA at an increased volume. Also, it was noted that during the flight SCP-069-UA made many sharp movements and collided with the walls of the containment chamber several times.\n\n\n\n> **Experiment \u2116:** E069-A\u2588\n\n> **Date:** 9/08/2011\n\n> **Procedure:**\u00a0\u00a0Playing //\u0421\u0432\u0430-\u0411\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043e\u043d// by a Ukrainian NSBM-group Dub Buk during an AEX-069 event.\n\n> **Result:** 47 seconds after the start of track SCP-069-UA flew out of the containment chamber and further along the corridor of Section 125, often bumping into walls and other obstacles. Before the event ended SCP-069-UA flew 900 meters and stopped near [REDACTED]. It was also noted that the object emitted SCP-069-M1-UA with different volume and speed. Observation has indicated that SCP-069-UA was not damaged.\n\n> //Under certain conditions this object can be very dangerous.// - Senior Researcher Shevchenko, Section 125 Director.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n> **Experiment \u2116:** E069-B\u2588\n\n> **Date:** 13/08/2011\n\n> **Procedure:** Filling SCP-069-UA with pieces of wet wood before the AEX-069 event.\n\n> **Result:** During AEX-069, the wood was burned to a great amount of cinder. The mass of cinder was \u2588\u2588% the mass of the original wood.\n\n\n\n> **Experiment \u2116:** E069-B\u2588\n\n> **Date:** 20/08/2011\n\n> **Procedure:** Filling SCP-069-UA with ice cubes and copper shavings before the AEX-069 event.\n\n> **Result:** During AEX-069 the ice evaporated completely. The copper shavings turned to a powdered mix of copper oxides and hydroxides.\n\n\n\n> **Experiment \u2116:** E069-B\u2588\n\n> **Date:** 23/08/2011\n\n> **Procedure:** Placing a thermometer inside SCP-069-UA before the AEX-069 event.\n\n> **Result:** Immediately after the event has ended the thermometer\u2019s readings matched room temperature. No traces of it having been heated were found.\n\n\n\n> **Experiment \u2116:** E069-B\u2588\n\n> **Date:** 27/08/2011\n\n> **Procedure:** Placing a specimen of //Passer domesticus// (House sparrow) inside SCP-069-UA before the AEX-069 event.\n\n> **Result:** [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n> //We must remember that the object reacts to sounds, and sometimes in a very weird way.//\u00a0\u00a0- Senior Researcher Shevchenko, Lead Researcher of the Test Battery E069-B.\n\n> **Note:** Further experiments involving the placement of living creatures inside SCP-069-UA were prohibited by the Ethics Committee.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n> **Experiment \u2116:** E069-D\u2588\n\n> **Date:** 7/11/2011\n\n> **Procedure:** Before the AEX-069 event, SCP-069-UA was put inside a locked safe. Lead Researcher was monitoring the experiment from [REDACTED] observation room.\n\n> **Result:** One minute after the event had started, SCP-069-UA breached the safe wall, several other walls and struck the researcher who initiated this experiment, killing him. According to the recorded footage of the incident, SCP-069-UA has reached a top speed of \u2588\u2588\u2588 m/s.\n\n> The AEX-069 event lasted for 30 minutes; in addition to SCP-069-M1-UA and SCP-069-M2-UA the songs //\"\u0418 \u0432\u043d\u043e\u0432\u044c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0431\u043e\u0439[[footnote]]\"The battle goes on again\"[[/footnote]]\"//, and //\"\u0414\u0435\u043d\u044c \u041f\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u044b[[footnote]]\"Victory day\"[[/footnote]]\"//, as well as \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 were heard sounding from the object.\n\n> Further experiments with placing SCP-069-UA inside any confined spaces less than 2 x 2 x 2 meters in size are prohibited.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Note E4-069.html : Clearance level 4/069 required\" hide=\"- CLEARANCE GRANTED\" hideLocation=\"top\"]]\n\n\n\n>> **Experiment \u2116:** E069-NUC\n\n>> **Date:** //The experiment was not conducted.

As normal felling is impossible, if a specimen is found outside of the Foundation, it is to be removed immediately by Sangrok Construction Planning Inc., a Foundation front company, under the guise of roadwork, building maintenance or other construction projects.</p>\n<p>Unconditioned subjects find it difficult to distinguish SCP-071-KO from normal streetlights. The Foundation has thus created a manual, instructing readers how to distinguish between regular streetlights and SCP-071-KO. The ten specimens currently kept in Foundation custody are to receive electric power and status checks twice a day. Any seed or sapling produced by the specimens is to be terminated.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-071-KO is a species of tree, botanically belonging in the family <em>Cupressaceae</em>. Smaller specimens generally measure around 3m but can grow to as much as 12m at their tallest, with even greater heights being possible under the right conditions. Botanically speaking, it is undoubtedly a plant, which can be verified via microscopic observation. Despite this, instances appear surprisingly similar to standard streetlights. Mostly, the tree grows upright with hollow trunks. The xylem resembles electric wiring and the tree absorbs electricity by way of its root system through these xylems. The treetop holds a translucent, bioluminescent organ, which emits light at low luminous intensity under 3-4 lux in order to attract insects.</p>\n<p>The crown is notable for its total lack of leaves, and it appears incapable of photosynthesis. Instead, SCP-071-KO grows by absorbing electricity. CO and NO<sub>n</sub>, mainly from vehicular exhaust, serves to boost the growth of SCP-071-KO. Being facultative insectivores, consuming insects also aid in the absorption of nutrients. Although it is unknown exactly which organ performs the insectivorous activity, insect carcasses often pile up inside the bioluminescent organ, and this organ as such is presumed to play a part in SCP-071-KO's insectivory. As a consequence, it is usually found in the urban environments rich in electric lines and vehicular exhaust fumes. It may also be found in unexpected locations such as on mountainsides or in the middle of open fields.</p>\n</div></body></html>", "raw_source": "\n\t[[module css]]\n\n.scp-image-block {display:none};\n\n[[/module]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-071-ko\">:scp-int:scp-071-ko</a>]]\n", "references": [], "scp": "SCP-071-KO", "scp_number": 71, "series": "international", "tags": ["_ko", "alive", "arboreal", "electrical", "international", "light", "plant", "safe", "scp", "species"], "title": "SCP-071-KO", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-071-ko"}, "SCP-072-TH": {"created_at": "2018-10-15T08:41:00", "creator": "INT_Translator", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "INT_Translator", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/int-translator", "comment": "", "date": "2018-10-15T08:41:00"}, {"author": "INT_Translator", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/int-translator", "comment": "Parent page set to: \"scp-international\".", "date": "2018-10-15T08:42:00"}, {"author": "INT_Translator", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/int-translator", "comment": "Added tags: alive, clothing, euclid, humanoid, international, location, metallic, mobile, ritual, sapient, scp, sentient, swarm, weapon.

Outpost-72-TH has been established on a nearby island. Security personnel are to turn away any civilians approaching the area within 2\u00a0km radius from the island. At least one combat team with heavy weaponry must be stationed in Outpost Site 72-TH at all times in case of an SCP-072-TH attack. Seabed vibration sensors have been installed around the island. Any personnel wishing to approach the island within 100\u00a0m require written permission from the project director.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-072-TH are a group of animated full plate armors similar to 13th century knight armor. As the Foundation is unable to subdue or neutralize SCP-072-TH and due to the objects' hostility, currently there is no sample of SCP-072-TH in the possession of the Foundation. Although all instances of SCP-072-TH appear to be empty, they can move on their own with surprisingly high agility and speed, consistent to a human of similar size who practices athletic activities on a regular basis. They also have higher strength than humans. SCP-072-TH is much more durable when compared to non-anomalous steel armor of same design. Although high explosives and heavy bludgeoning can cause the armor to be badly dented and firearms being able to penetrate them, the Foundation is so far unable to cause enough damage to break even a small part out of the armor. They can move with full efficiency regardless of the damage. There is a hypothesis that each instance of SCP-072-TH is a unique entity. Their current numbers are unconfirmed, but estimated to be at least 40 instances. It was initially believed that SCP-072-TH can restore damage on their own, but tracking a damaged suit with a remote device indicates that they keep reserve armors within the castle and SCP-072-TH can transfer its anomalous properties from the damaged armor to a reserve. It is unknown what happens to the damaged armor.</p>\n<p>SCP-072-TH is capable of speaking in an unknown language. All attempts to communicate with them ended in failure. It was noted that SCP-072-TH never uses vocal methods to communicate with each other, yet they display the ability to work as a team. There is a hypothesis that SCP-072-TH are not sentient and their speech is merely an automatic warning message. SCP-072-TH has combat skills comparable to a trained soldier, and is known to use tactics including usage of traps, set up of ambushes, and using guerrilla tactics by taking advantage of the environment. SCP-072-TH were armed with only a broadsword initially, but are found using other medieval weapons since Incident 072-TH-B. The weapons used by SCP-072-TH have a hardness anomaly similar to the armor itself. Prior to Incident 072-TH-B, it was possible to make limited exploration using an aerial drone as SCP-072-TH would ignore it unless the drone would attempt to get into the castle, at which point SCP-072-Th would chase it off. This made it effective to survey most of the island including the outer wall of the castle. However, SCP-072-TH has aggressively attacked aerial drones since Incident 072-TH-B, as well as destroying all remote survey devices. There is no report of SCP-072-TH getting into the body of water surrounding the island, although they were observed to patrol or stand guard near the coast.</p>\n<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-072-TH was first discovered in Castle \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a tourist attraction on the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Island after a report of missing tourists during a tour trip. The local officers proceeded to search the location and discovered an undocumented secret passage. The search team encounter SCP-072-TH afterward, resulting in \u2588 casualties among the castle's staff and officers. An embedded agent within the police department informed the Foundation with a report of how they were attacked by animated armors. After an investigation team had confirmed the anomaly, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Island has been declared a dangerous area in cooperation with the government, with a cover story of unstable underground rock formations and toxic gas leaks. All casualties had suffered from the gas's hallucinogenic effects and killed themselves. All witnesses have been administered amnestics and released.</p>\n<p>According to official records, the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Island was used to imprison persons of significant status during the period of the Middle Ages, including individuals accused of practicing black magic. It was abandoned until it was recently renovated for tourism purposes less than a year before the discovery incident. There is no record of anomalous activity prior to the discovery.</p>\n<p><strong>Incident 072-TH-B</strong><br/>\n\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: MTF-\u0e04 \"Don Quixote\" lead by Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was assigned to the exploration of Castle \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. The team was supposed to enter the castle keep by helicopter-drop as it's deemed to be safe from SCP-072-TH. However, the helicopter was shot down by a group of SCP-072-TH using heavy crossbows<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>. Three members of MTF-\u0e04 were rescued afterward, and they confirmed that other personnel were killed either by the crash or by SCP-072-TH<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup>. During the escape, the Foundation rescue craft was hit by several bolts from a SCP-072-TH's heavy crossbow. Analysis of these bolts reveal that they're made from non-anomalous steel which is inconsistent to the damage upon the craft. There is a hypothesis that the anomalous effect of SCP-072-TH is either limited to the area around \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Island or SCP-072-TH themselves. The full report of Incident 072-TH-B is still in the compiling and review process.</p>\n<p>Afterwards, an aerial survey revealed that the wreckage of the Foundation's helicopter has disappeared although the crashing damage to the landscape is still visible. The possibility of SCP-072-TH utilizing heavy equipment such as a siege weapon or getting off the island by walking underwater is being considered. The containment procedures have been updated and a proposal to reclassify the object class is currently under review.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes-footer\">\n<div class=\"title\">Footnotes</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-1\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-1')\">1</a>.

The cell is provided with a table and an electrical outlet, to which it must remain connected in order to avoid resets of SCP-079-IT-1. SCP-079-IT must be at least 0.7 meters away from any technology produced after 1982, except for experiments approved by <a href=\"http://scp-int.wikidot.com/organizzazione-interna\">DRIA</a>.

Its CPU is incapable of reading floppy disks: on the other hand, the SCP-079-IT is able to interact with other electronic devices, through a forced connection with them. SCP-079-IT is able to do this by using electronic networks, both private and public<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>. Once connected, one is capable of interacting with SCP-079-IT via its connected device, in the rare cases where the SCP-079-IT operating system, PCOS, allows it. In most cases, the SCP-079-IT interacts with the connected device, copying its processes and codes and applying them to itself<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup>. Most of the time, SCP-079-IT is unable to process the collected data, resulting in a crash and reboot. Once restarted, SCP-079-IT does not remember the information it previously absorbed and will attempt to connect again.</p>\n<p>In addition to the operating system, there is another preinstalled program in SCP-079-IT. It is a real-time simulation game set in Ancient Rome, which for graphic<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup> and processual capabilities should not be able to start on an M20. The game, from here on SCP-079-IT-1, will start when <tt>carica\"0:0\"</tt> is typed on the home screen: the command will automatically create a new world, that is a rapidly expanding Roman city. As it turns out, the game has no home screen and no credits, making it impossible to discover its author.<br/>\nThe purpose of the game seems to be to observe the development of the city. During the game, the city will expand in both buildings and population, give rise to a more complex system of government, and bring out certain personalities as well as typicalities of the place.<br/>\nSCP-079-1 is devoid of any graphical interface and options. This not only prevents one from acting technically on it, adjusting the volume or zooming, but also from taking part in the game itself and saving it. For this reason, the game will start over every time SCP-079-IT crashes.<br/>\nIn the standard speed each second is equivalent to one second in real-time: further speeds, since the dedicated command keys are not present, are impossible to reach.</p>\n<p><strong>Recovery:</strong> SCP-079-IT has been acquired in an auction in Rome. Members of <a href=\"http://scp-int.wikidot.com/squadre-speciali-mobili#SIR-I\">SIR-I Aure\u00e6 Notiti\u00e6</a> had gone there to view a supposedly anomalous item, which turned out to be a simple necklace of fake diamonds. SCP-079-IT was an early item, an heirloom that the batter's grandfather was very fond of, according to the batter himself. Having invited those present to play SCP-079-IT-1, a member of the \u03b2 Squad, Agent Moiro, agreed and turned on the PC. SCP-079-IT then manifested its anomalous properties in front of the agent by inputting the ringtone of his smartphone as game audio. SCP-079-IT reset itself almost instantly, thereby evading the attention of the batter. It was made to believe that the ringtone was coming from the audience.<br/>\nThe piece was purchased at \u2588\u2588\u2588 euros, due to the disinterest of those present. The batter has been interviewed, although it hasn\u2019t been possible to obtain further information, as he confessed the PC was stolen and the story invented.</p>\n<p><strong>Experiments on SCP-079-IT:</strong> The most relevant experiments conducted on SCP-079-IT follow. Only experiments in which SCP-079-IT did not crash due to the amount of information, or in which important details were revealed before that happened, are marked.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Test 1, 19/10/19\u2588\u2588 - Range of action of SCP-079-IT</strong></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Subject:</strong> A Bluetooth speaker<br/>\n<strong>Procedure:</strong> The speaker has been placed next to SCP-079-IT<br/>\n<strong>Results:</strong> The SCP-079-IT-1's in-game audio changed, following the music coming out of the speaker.<br/>\n<strong>Analysis:</strong> <em>I wonder what\u2019s its range.</em> Dr. Limares</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Test 12, 07/02/200\u2588 - Type of technology it comes into contact with</strong></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Subject:</strong> A walkie-talkie from the \u201870s<br/>\n<strong>Procedure:</strong> The walkie-talkie has been placed next to SCP-079-IT<br/>\n<strong>Results:</strong> No effects.<br/>\n<strong>Analysis:</strong> <em>SCP-079-IT does not appear to be able to connect to devices older than itself.

Thinking it was an experiment done before, I was about to delete it when I realized what was happening.</p>\n<p>An immense quantity of papyrus sheets had been placed on the ground. Several men in slave tunics, many of whom had just arrived with the rich lords, stood around it, supervised by some soldiers. Most of the sheets were already full of writing - very large so that they could be seen from the sky. When those men stood up, not long afterward, the writings formed a meaningful text in classical Latin.</p>\n<p>I studied it in high school, thus I kind of understood what were they saying, though to avoid misunderstandings I copied and sent it to Historical-Archaeological Section for a translation. I did not specify its true origin: as far as they know, it is a project left by Dr. Dossi, one of the ideas he failed to test.</p>\n<p>This is the translation I received:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Oh, elusive deities,</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Why do you rage so hard against mortals who are incapable of fighting as you do?</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Why do you shun the gifts we give you, why do you not participate in the festivals we celebrate in your honour?</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Why do you not respond to our divine brothers, who intercede on our behalf, their hair torn off, their clothes tattered for this undeserved punishment?</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>If you answer, it is an unknown language, never read by man. And your powers, however immense, cannot go beyond the borders of this humble town.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Such cruel behaviour, worthy of the fiercest barbarians, does not belong to powerful gods who care about the Roman people.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Therefore, we invite you to cease your evil deeds and to leave these lands. Our gods are powerful: they rule the sky, the waters, and Tartarus. One of them holds this pleasant place, the cradle of his childhood, very dear to his heart and will not hesitate to fight for it.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Janus Bifrons is on our side. And us, in his Order on this appointed day, we will not hesitate to follow him into battle.</em></p>\n<p>The reference to <a href=\"http://scp-int.wikidot.com/gruppi-di-interesse#OI\">Ordo Iani</a>, I believe, is obvious. It could be a coincidence, I grant you, but I stopped believing in coincidences nineteen years ago. Rather, I believe that the experiments we carried out were intended as gestures from a deity, or demon, or whatever.<br/>\nWhich struck me as odd at the time: from what I was told in orientation, the creation of the Order had to do with a volcano. I can't remember how, as that was a long time ago and I've never interacted with the GoI in my work, but I'm sure it had something to do with it.</p>\n<p>However, I was wrong: when I went to review the documents for the new arrivals, there was no trace of the volcano. I copy the relevant part of the Introduction/4635/GOI:</p>\n<p><em>It was founded by the Roman Emperor Claudius in 43 AD. The monarch assembled a circle consisting of the best priests and generals of the time, with the task of investigating a political-religious affair. The documents produced in that early period, with the exception of the motto \u201cJanus Bifrons is on our side\u201d, have been lost, and the evidence dates from 79 AD., the year in which Emperor Titus entrusted the circle to the scholars.</em></p>\n<p>I asked for confirmation from the Diplomatic Affairs Section, and they sent me further documents, including a letter from the outgoing director, who confirmed the Introduction. It was Dr. Rossetti, a member of the Order, who gave a sense of the image of the volcano: in 79 AD there was the eruption of Vesuvius, which prompted the emperor to turn the circle into a study group instead of a war group against the unknown. She herself, however, could not give me any more information about the earlier period.<br/>\nPersonally, I do not think documents were lost: simply enough, they haven\u2019t been created yet.</p>\n<p>In fact, I strongly believe that the cause of this discrepancy is SCP-079-IT: when one influences it, they are not changing an imaginary world, contained in the computer, but the actual past. The various changes made there could then be reflected on this timeline and our knowledge of it, from a simple gesture such as a stone not previously present to the different origins of the Group of Interest. Or, to use a more understandable image, to the disappearance of the Colosseum.</p>\n<p>I do not know if it is possible to control these changes, or if it is possible to keep a record of them, as it is not my field. Therefore, I would ask for SCP-079-IT to be immediately transferred to <a href=\"http://scp-int.wikidot.com/siti-italiani#Sito-Deus\">Site Deus</a>: there they know better how to deal with space-time anomalies like SCP-079-IT.</p>\n<p>In case you missed the volcano issue yourself, I ask you this: before today, do you remember ever hearing the motto of the Order? Even better, do you remember <em>if</em> the Order had one?<br/>\nLet me anticipate your answer: before today, it didn't.</p>\n<p>Signed,<br/>\nDr. Olivia Limares</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">New\u00a0Special\u00a0Containment\u00a0Procedures\u00a0for\u00a0SCP-079-IT</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Close\u00a0document</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-079-IT must be contained in a room on top of tower 6 of <a href=\"http://scp-int.wikidot.com/siti-italiani#Sito-Deus\">Site Deus</a>, accessible only with the key provided by director Michela Marchetti.

The cell is provided with a table and an electrical outlet, to which it must remain connected in order to avoid resets of SCP-079-IT-1. SCP-079-IT must be at least 0.7 meters away from any technology produced after 1982, except for experiments approved by [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/organizzazione-interna DRIA]. To access it, a request must be made to the Logistics and Timing board of Site Vulcano, which will assess requests on a case-by-case basis. Access is granted to staff of Level 1 and above.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-079-IT is a model M-20 computer manufactured by Olivetti in 1982, lacking a hard disk. Its CPU is incapable of reading floppy disks: on the other hand, the SCP-079-IT is able to interact with other electronic devices, through a forced connection with them. SCP-079-IT is able to do this by using electronic networks, both private and public [[footnote]] With still unknown methods, SCP-079-IT manages to not have to put passwords in protected networks [[/footnote]]. Once connected, one is capable of interacting with SCP-079-IT via its connected device, in the rare cases where the SCP-079-IT operating system, PCOS, allows it. In most cases, the SCP-079-IT interacts with the connected device, copying its processes and codes and applying them to itself [[footnote]] Sometimes, this can substantially change SCP-079-IT-1. See Experiment Logs for further details.[[/footnote]]. Most of the time, SCP-079-IT is unable to process the collected data, resulting in a crash and reboot. Once restarted, SCP-079-IT does not remember the information it previously absorbed and will attempt to connect again.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the operating system, there is another preinstalled program in SCP-079-IT. It is a real-time simulation game set in Ancient Rome, which for graphic[[footnote]] It is suspected that textures are taken from \"Age of Empire: Rise of Rome\", a videogame published in 1998, without authorization [[/footnote]] and processual capabilities should not be able to start on an M20. The game, from here on SCP-079-IT-1, will start when {{carica\"0:0\"}} is typed on the home screen: the command will automatically create a new world, that is a rapidly expanding Roman city. As it turns out, the game has no home screen and no credits, making it impossible to discover its author.\n\nThe purpose of the game seems to be to observe the development of the city. During the game, the city will expand in both buildings and population, give rise to a more complex system of government, and bring out certain personalities as well as typicalities of the place.\n\nSCP-079-1 is devoid of any graphical interface and options. This not only prevents one from acting technically on it, adjusting the volume or zooming, but also from taking part in the game itself and saving it. For this reason, the game will start over every time SCP-079-IT crashes.\n\nIn the standard speed each second is equivalent to one second in real-time: further speeds, since the dedicated command keys are not present, are impossible to reach.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Recovery:** SCP-079-IT has been acquired in an auction in Rome. Members of [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/squadre-speciali-mobili#SIR-I SIR-I Aure\u00e6 Notiti\u00e6] had gone there to view a supposedly anomalous item, which turned out to be a simple necklace of fake diamonds. SCP-079-IT was an early item, an heirloom that the batter's grandfather was very fond of, according to the batter himself. Having invited those present to play SCP-079-IT-1, a member of the \u03b2 Squad, Agent Moiro, agreed and turned on the PC. SCP-079-IT then manifested its anomalous properties in front of the agent by inputting the ringtone of his smartphone as game audio. SCP-079-IT reset itself almost instantly, thereby evading the attention of the batter. It was made to believe that the ringtone was coming from the audience.\n\nThe piece was purchased at \u2588\u2588\u2588 euros, due to the disinterest of those present. The batter has been interviewed, although it hasn\u2019t been possible to obtain further information, as he confessed the PC was stolen and the story invented.\n\n\n\n**Experiments on SCP-079-IT:** The most relevant experiments conducted on SCP-079-IT follow. Only experiments in which SCP-079-IT did not crash due to the amount of information, or in which important details were revealed before that happened, are marked.\n\n\n\n__**Test 1, 19/10/19\u2588\u2588 - Range of action of SCP-079-IT**__\n\n> **Subject:** A Bluetooth speaker\n\n> **Procedure:** The speaker has been placed next to SCP-079-IT\n\n> **Results:** The SCP-079-IT-1's in-game audio changed, following the music coming out of the speaker.\n\n> **Analysis:** //I wonder what\u2019s its range.// Dr. Limares\n\n\n\n__**Test 12, 07/02/200\u2588 - Type of technology it comes into contact with**__\n\n> **Subject:** A walkie-talkie from the \u201870s\n\n> **Procedure:** The walkie-talkie has been placed next to SCP-079-IT\n\n> **Results:** No effects.\n\n> **Analysis:** //SCP-079-IT does not appear to be able to connect to devices older than itself. This needs to be further verified.// Dr. Dossi\n\n\n\n__**Test 14, 13/02/201\u2588 - Type of technology it comes into contact with**__\n\n> **Subject:** PS4 console. No game put inside\n\n> **Procedure:** The console has been placed next to SCP-079-IT\n\n> **Results:** The console GUI representing the player profile, in this case, Dr. Rallo's son, appeared on SCP-079-IT. SCP-079-IT-1 continued to run behind the background that had become transparent, although very slowly. SCP-079-IT crashed after 2 minutes.\n\n> **Analysis:** //SCP-079-IT-1 doesn\u2019t seem to be strictly correlated to SCP-079-IT, with the ability to run even when the former manifests its anomalous properties. Maybe SCP-079-IT-1 is not anomalous at all in itself? If one could extract the file, it would be interesting to have a look at it.// Dr. Rallo\n\n\n\n__**Test 21, 26/12/201\u2588 - Type of technology it comes into contact with**__\n\n> **Subject:** --Dr. Dossi\u2019s personal--[[footnote]] //Test denied due to security risk. It's not worth risking your privacy for a few experiments.// Director Tullio Cruciani [[/footnote]] cellphone fresh from the factory\n\n> **Procedure:** Cellphone has been placed next to SCP-079-IT\n\n> **Results:** Once connected, SCP-079-IT went back to the photo gallery and applied the process in SCP-079-IT-1. During the game day, photos appeared at the top of the screen, mostly from the point of view of the inhabitants of the town, in the graphics of the application.\n\n> **Analysis:** //SCP-079-IT seems to interact not only with the GUI but also with the NPCs themselves. Perhaps it is possible to make them respond to external impulses? Is this something envisaged by those who built this kind of technology?// Dr. Dossi\n\n\n\n__**Test 25, 03/01/201\u2588 - New methods to influence SCP-079-IT**__\n\n> **Subject:** Dr. Dossi\n\n> **Procedure:** Dr. Dossi typed \"Hello\" on SCP-079-IT\u2019s keyboard\n\n> **Results:** Word appeared on the town square floor. The market that used to take place there was discontinued, and the square was no longer frequented.\n\n> **Analysis:** //My hypothesis was correct. Now we can continue testing on SCP-079-IT without risks to privacy, resets, and crashes.// Dott. Dossi\n\n\n\n__**Test 35, 04/01/201\u2588 - In-depth study of the keyboard of SCP-079-IT**__\n\n> **Subject:** SCP-079-IT\n\n> **Procedure:** On SCP-079-IT\u2019s keyboard has been typed the command: \"Create rock\"\n\n> **Results:** A rock has been created outside the city.\n\n> **Analysis:** //It is now possible to modify SCP-079-IT-1 at an impressive speed and accuracy, without taking advantage of the anomalous effects of SCP-079-IT. One must, of course, watch out for the curious people who have been wandering around the city lately.// Dr. Limares\n\n\n\n__**Test 36, 07/01/201\u2588 - In-depth study of the keyboard of SCP-079-IT**__\n\n> **Subject:**\u00a0\u00a0SCP-079-IT\n\n> **Procedure:** On the keyboard has been typed the command: \"Delete hello\"\n\n> **Results:** The \"Hello\" on the town square has been deleted.\n\n> **Analysis:** //It is possible to correct commands. And now, at least, the citizens will no longer be so upset and all those numerous lords with servants in tow, who have increased the population recently, will be able to make themselves useful.// Dr. Limares\n\n\n\n__**Test 39, 13/01/201\u2588 - NPCs interactions in SCP-079-IT-1**__\n\n> **Subject:** SCP-079-IT\n\n> **Procedure:** On the keyboard has been firstly typed the command \"Go to war\", then \"Let\u2019s go to war\" and, in the end, \"War\"\n\n> **Results:** No effects.\n\n> **Analysis:** //Overriding the free will of citizens does not seem possible.// Dr. Dossi\n\n\n\n//Following this test, Dr. Dossi has been accused of not having taken a serious approach in SCP-079-IT\u2019s analysis, as the last two commands were typed without authorization.

Thinking it was an experiment done before, I was about to delete it when I realized what was happening.\n\n> \n\n> An immense quantity of papyrus sheets had been placed on the ground. Several men in slave tunics, many of whom had just arrived with the rich lords, stood around it, supervised by some soldiers. Most of the sheets were already full of writing - very large so that they could be seen from the sky. When those men stood up, not long afterward, the writings formed a meaningful text in classical Latin.\n\n> \n\n> I studied it in high school, thus I kind of understood what were they saying, though to avoid misunderstandings I copied and sent it to Historical-Archaeological Section for a translation. I did not specify its true origin: as far as they know, it is a project left by Dr. Dossi, one of the ideas he failed to test.\n\n> \n\n> This is the translation I received:\n\n> \n\n> \n\n> = //Oh, elusive deities,//\n\n> = //Why do you rage so hard against mortals who are incapable of fighting as you do?//\n\n> = //Why do you shun the gifts we give you, why do you not participate in the festivals we celebrate in your honour?//\n\n> = //Why do you not respond to our divine brothers, who intercede on our behalf, their hair torn off, their clothes tattered for this undeserved punishment?//\n\n> = //If you answer, it is an unknown language, never read by man. And your powers, however immense, cannot go beyond the borders of this humble town.//\n\n> = //Such cruel behaviour, worthy of the fiercest barbarians, does not belong to powerful gods who care about the Roman people.//\n\n> = //Therefore, we invite you to cease your evil deeds and to leave these lands. Our gods are powerful: they rule the sky, the waters, and Tartarus. One of them holds this pleasant place, the cradle of his childhood, very dear to his heart and will not hesitate to fight for it.//\n\n> = //Janus Bifrons is on our side. And us, in his Order on this appointed day, we will not hesitate to follow him into battle.//\n\n> \n\n> \n\n> The reference to [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/gruppi-di-interesse#OI Ordo Iani], I believe, is obvious. It could be a coincidence, I grant you, but I stopped believing in coincidences nineteen years ago. Rather, I believe that the experiments we carried out were intended as gestures from a deity, or demon, or whatever.\n\n> Which struck me as odd at the time: from what I was told in orientation, the creation of the Order had to do with a volcano. I can't remember how, as that was a long time ago and I've never interacted with the GoI in my work, but I'm sure it had something to do with it.\n\n> \n\n> However, I was wrong: when I went to review the documents for the new arrivals, there was no trace of the volcano. I copy the relevant part of the Introduction/4635/GOI:\n\n> \n\n> //It was founded by the Roman Emperor Claudius in 43 AD. The monarch assembled a circle consisting of the best priests and generals of the time, with the task of investigating a political-religious affair. The documents produced in that early period, with the exception of the motto \u201cJanus Bifrons is on our side\u201d, have been lost, and the evidence dates from 79 AD., the year in which Emperor Titus entrusted the circle to the scholars.//\n\n> \n\n> I asked for confirmation from the Diplomatic Affairs Section, and they sent me further documents, including a letter from the outgoing director, who confirmed the Introduction. It was Dr. Rossetti, a member of the Order, who gave a sense of the image of the volcano: in 79 AD there was the eruption of Vesuvius, which prompted the emperor to turn the circle into a study group instead of a war group against the unknown. She herself, however, could not give me any more information about the earlier period.\n\n> Personally, I do not think documents were lost: simply enough, they haven\u2019t been created yet.\n\n> \n\n> In fact, I strongly believe that the cause of this discrepancy is SCP-079-IT: when one influences it, they are not changing an imaginary world, contained in the computer, but the actual past. The various changes made there could then be reflected on this timeline and our knowledge of it, from a simple gesture such as a stone not previously present to the different origins of the Group of Interest. Or, to use a more understandable image, to the disappearance of the Colosseum.\n\n> \n\n> I do not know if it is possible to control these changes, or if it is possible to keep a record of them, as it is not my field. Therefore, I would ask for SCP-079-IT to be immediately transferred to [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/siti-italiani#Sito-Deus Site Deus]: there they know better how to deal with space-time anomalies like SCP-079-IT.\n\n> \n\n> In case you missed the volcano issue yourself, I ask you this: before today, do you remember ever hearing the motto of the Order? Even better, do you remember //if// the Order had one?\n\n> Let me anticipate your answer: before today, it didn't.\n\n> \n\n> Signed,\n\n> Dr. Olivia Limares\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n@@@@\n\n[[collapsible show=\"New Special Containment Procedures for SCP-079-IT\" hide=\"Close document\"]]\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-079-IT must be contained in a room on top of tower 6 of [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/siti-italiani#Sito-Deus Site Deus], accessible only with the key provided by director Michela Marchetti. The room is equipped with a small table and an electrical outlet, to which SCP-079-IT must remain connected in order to avoid the destruction of SCP-079-IT-1 and the town it represents. SCP-079-IT must be at least 0.7 meters away from any technology produced after 1982. It is forbidden to let unauthorized members know its location.\n\n\n\nThe only people who know about the new location are the directors of the Sites Volcano and Deus, and the S5s. If it becomes known to an unauthorized member, they will have to undergo amnestic treatment. Dr. Olivia Limares, the discoverer of the actual anomalous properties of SCP-079-IT, and Captain Iadanza, a member of the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/squadre-speciali-mobili#SSM-VII SSM-VII \"Turm\u00e6 Angelorum\"] who transported the object to the Site Deus in great secrecy, have already undergone the same process voluntarily.\n\n\n\nThe Site Volcano Logistics and Timing office was instructed to declare SCP-079-IT always busy for other tests: if any member of the office asks too many questions, it is instructed to administer them Class-A amnestics and find additional employment.\n\n\n\nContact with SCP-079-IT is allowed only to the director Michela Marchetti, exclusively for observation and control purposes. If the actions of the humans present in SCP-079-IT-1 differ from what is assumed to be the course of History, thus leading to a Class-CK Reality Restructuring Scenario, or if they cause many minor changes in a short period of time, thus leading to civilians becoming aware of the CK-Class Restructuring Scenario, the S5s must be contacted immediately to implement the contingency plan established in these scenarios.

The item can be used only for testing purposes, with prior authorization needed from the research coordinator. Knowing the hypothetical risks related to the use of the object, SCP-082-IT can be worn only by D-Class personnel. Given the absence of anomalous activity when not used, its containment does not require any additional safety measures.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-082-IT is a bronze helmet of Corinthian design; although its creator and origins are still unknown, thermoluminescent dating<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> traces the origin near the 8th-century BCE., at the beginning of the Archaic Greece period. As shown by repeated experiments, SCP-082-IT seemingly appears to be devoid of any anomalous properties; once worn, however, it will enter its active state.</p>\n<p>An inscription written in Greek will appear on the front of the helmet, which reads: <em>\"\u039a\u03b1\u03b9 o \u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03cc\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 o \u03b4\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2\"</em> (<em>\"Both the wise and the powerful\"</em>, which can be interpreted as <em>\"The one who knows is the one who holds power\"</em>). The individual wearing SCP-082-IT will experience a hyperfunction of their cognitive processes, mainly affecting vigilance, ideation, memory, and intellect. The nature and intensity of these alterations vary according to the time spent on the head.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>From the start of the test to 6 hours (the \"maniacal\" phase): the subjects will show hyperactivity, rapid speech and low attention span; when given freedom of choice they'll prefer to dedicate themselves to activities that require the use of creativity (i.e.: writing or drawing), switching from one to the other in a disorganized manner.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>From 6 to 48 hours (the \"performative\" phase): the subject behaves more coherently and is now capable of focusing on specific activities. Standardized tests reveal an improvement in logical-mathematical, linguistic, visuospatial, and procedural intelligence performances, with every score being above average. 3-4 hours of sleep seem to be enough for adequate rest.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>From 48 hours to 5 days (the \"wise\" phase): the subject reaches intellectual levels no longer measurable through tests conceived for normal human beings, being capable of learning enormous quantities of information in a very short time period and executing any task with maximum efficiency (i.e.: learning from scratch to play an instrument or solving complex mathematical equations); they also develop an eidetic memory, allowing them to remember even the most insignificant details. The need to sleep is abolished altogether.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>From 5 to 7 days (the \"encyclopedic\" phase): the subject is capable of \"remembering\" information that they have never come to know before, which is virtually the entirety of human knowledge; notions are verbalized in response to specific questions but are also capable of emerging spontaneously, in the form of intrusive thoughts that interfere with the normal flow of thoughts.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>For information about longer duration tests see <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Incident 082/1971</span>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>EEG highlights an uninterrupted and increasingly higher Beta and Gamma<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> wave brain activity, even with closed eyes; sedative and hypnotic drugs have little to no effect. Part of the waves originate from SCP-082-IT itself as if they \"overwrite\" those of the host; it's therefore not clear whether SCP-082-IT merely influences the minds of others or whether it possesses some form of consciousness itself. As soon as SCP-082-IT is removed, the alterations will cease and the individual will appear confused and disoriented, reporting memory loss regarding the period of use.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 082-IT (Recovery):</strong> SCP-082-IT was part of the private collection of [REDACTED], a rich and well-known collector of ancient artifacts, who purchased it on the black market from an unknown seller. Its anomalous properties have remained unobserved for a long period of time, until the man's child, 9 years old, decided to casually wear the helmet for fun; when the parents discovered him after several hours, the child had begun to manifest signs of an IQ far above the norm. The rumors about the \"little genius\" and the \"miraculous helmet\" reached the Foundation's agents, who then proceeded to cover up the news and confiscate SCP-082-IT.</p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25b6\u00a0UPDATE:\u00a0Incident\u00a0082/1971</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u25c0\u25c0\u25c0\u00a0UPDATE:\u00a0Incident\u00a0082/1971</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h1 id=\"toc0\"><span>ATTENTION!</span></h1>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">By order of the <a href=\"http://scp-int.wikidot.com/organizzazione-interna\">Ethical-Moral Regulation Section</a> (SRE-M), access to the following document has been prohibited to personnel with an authorization lower than Level 4.

(83).</p>\n<p><strong>Objectives:</strong> Verifying the effects of SCP-082-IT for periods longer than one week.</p>\n<p><strong>Setting:</strong> D-1971 is housed in a room with everything needed to test his performance (a table, a wall blackboard, various musical instruments and a library); the room comes with an attached bathroom, while a bed is considered superfluous. As already established in previous tests, the EEG's electrodes have been installed before wearing SCP-082-IT; liquids and nutrients, given the inability to feed, are supplied intravenously. Dr. Tagliani is assisted by two security officers.</p>\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">1ST DAY</span></strong></p>\n</div>\n<br/>\nBehavior doesn't vary significantly from other subjects'. As expected, the \"maniacal\" phase is followed by the \"performative\" one. By the end of the day, D-1971's I.Q. has increased over 50%, reaching the value of 128.\n<p><em><strong>Researcher's note:</strong> The first 6 hours have been a living hell, I've seen brats making much less of a mess. The room is full of papers smeared with attempts at abstract \"art\" and creative \"writing\". About that, I must remember to call a janitor to clean the walls.</em></p>\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">3RD DAY</span></strong></p>\n</div>\n<br/>\nBeginning of the \"wise\" phase. After less than an hour spent leafing through a musical theory manual, D-1971 is capable, after a single listening, of executing an error-free performance by ear of Korsakov's <em>Flight of the Bumblebee</em> for piano. After being invited to choose a book from the library, D-1971 hesitates in front of Wittgenstein's <em>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</em>, only to discard it in favor of a series of volumes in the math section. In the late afternoon, D-1971 has now bridged the gap with more educated subjects and approaches the study of advanced texts.\n<p><em><strong>Researcher's note:</strong> It's alienating to see a person juggling between formulas and theorems that, not even two days ago, would have caused nothing more than a blank face. The variety of choices of the subjects leads me to think that the helmet is a catalyst for certain unexpressed tendencies. I wonder if, in another life, D-1971 would have been a successful pianist or mathematician. Right now I'll allow him to continue; who knows if something interesting will come out of it.</em></p>\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">4TH DAY</span></strong></p>\n</div>\n<br/>\nAt 2:37\u00a0A.M., D-1971 suddenly leaves his books and rushes to the blackboard, writing down a series of mathematical formulas; he stops just before sunrise, contemplating the results of his calculations, only to erase everything and start all over again. This happens multiple times in the following hours at irregular intervals.\n<p>At 15:13, D-1971 declares himself satisfied and announces that he has come up with the formulation of a theorem that confirms the Riemann hypothesis<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup>.</p>\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">9TH DAY</span></strong></p>\n</div>\n<br/>\nDespite the appearance of the intrusive thoughts typical of the \"encyclopedic\" phase, D-1971 has decided to keep focusing on mathematical problems. It has been about two days longer than the longest test previously conducted.\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>&lt;Start of the Log&gt;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Tagliani:</strong> Good morning, D-1971.</p>\n<p><strong>D-1971:</strong> <em>[Intent to copy from a sheet of paper onto the blackboard]</em> Hyv\u00e4\u00e4 huomenta paskiainen.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Tagliani:</strong> Excuse me?</p>\n<p><strong>D-1971:</strong> I've said \"good morning\" in Finnish. Don't ask me how I know that, I just do.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Tagliani:</strong> <em>[Writing in his notebook]</em> Interesting, the more this phase goes on, the more complex the acquired knowledge becomes. Anyway\u2026 you'll be pleased to know I've received the verification of your calculations<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-4\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')\">4</a></sup> and it seems that everything's right. Even your theory about the Navier\u2013Stokes equations seems to be correct, the eggheads from <a href=\"http://scp-int.wikidot.com/siti-italiani#Sito-Vulcano\">Site Vulcano</a> almost wetted themselves from joy.</p>\n<p><strong>D-1971:</strong> Mere formalities, I'm more than certain about the accuracy of my calculations.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Tagliani:</strong> How is your work proceeding?</p>\n<p><strong>D-1971:</strong> I'm one step away from solving the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Tagliani:</strong> It's been 12 hours since the last infusion. Are you sure you don't really need a break?</p>\n<p><strong>D-1971:</strong> Never felt better, doctor. The only problems are those guards: they've been talking out loud all morning and that's keeping me from focusing.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Tagliani:</strong> I'll ask them to be quieter.</p>\n<p><strong>D-1971:</strong> Here, can you hear them? They've started again, I can't work in these conditions!</p>\n<p><em>Dr. Tagliani turns towards the guards. Both are completely silent.</em></p>\n<p><strong>&lt;End of the Log&gt;</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Researcher's note:</strong> They said again and again that adding this much time to the test was useless, but they were damn wrong!

D-1971's mental readiness seems to be partially affected by this; furthermore, it seems that the subject is gradually losing interest in those same activities he previously was enthusiast about.\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">13TH DAY</span></strong></p>\n</div>\n<br/>\nD-1971 interrupts his own research, refusing to continue; he also makes a feeble attempt to remove SCP-082-IT from his head, but he's immediately restrained. The deep apathetic state experienced by D-1971 is considered to be the beginning of a new stage, the \"nihilistic\" phase; Dr. Tagliani makes him wear a straitjacket to prevent other acts of defiance.\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>&lt;Start of the Log&gt;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Tagliani:</strong> I don't understand, D-1971. In a matter of days, you achieved something that many wouldn't be able to do in a lifetime. What\u2019s stopping you now?</p>\n<p><strong>D-1971:</strong> <em>[In a flat tone]</em> For what purpose, doctor? It's pointless to keep on writing and writing and writing. This infernal helmet gives me every answer to every question within a few milliseconds. Theory of Everything? Nothing more than a child's nursery rhyme. Cure for cancer? It's baffling how they still haven't got it. Reality is an open book; the thing is, no one before me had the right lens to read it.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Tagliani:</strong> <em>[Getting upset]</em> Even more so! Think about what we could achieve with similar knowledge in the right hands.</p>\n<p><strong>D-1971:</strong> <em>Right</em> hands, doctor? Yours, you mean? Or the Superintendence's hands, perhaps? Oh right, about that, I know everything there's to know about your dear Foundation, the helmet whispers it to me constantly. I know about all the deaths, the lab rats that came before me, and those that will come after me, I know about all the horrible things you do to contain your monsters, I even know what you're hiding there, <a href=\"http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-001-it-graf\">in that old castle</a>. And you know what the best part is? You seriously believe you're doing it for the greater good.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Tagliani:</strong> [EXPLICIT] the greater good! We're talking about science, this philosophical [EXPLICIT]\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>D-1971:</strong> \"\u2026 is not the reason why I'm here\". You can remove that ridiculous hat, I can still hear you either way. Actually I can hear all of you, but your voices aren't so annoying anymore, I tend to ignore them, truth be told. What is the useless babbling of inferior minds for those who can listen to the universe itself singing inside their eardrums?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Tagliani:</strong> This conversation\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>D-1971:</strong> \u2026is over. I know, doctor, I know <em>everything</em>, even if I'd like not to.</p>\n<p><strong>&lt;End of Log&gt;</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Researcher's note:</strong> I'm tempted to end the experiment, remove the helmet, give it to the next subject and start all over. However, there's more, I can feel it. It's better not to let anyone know, for now, that D-1971 has access to sensitive information. I'd just risk getting someone in the way.</em></p>\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">15TH DAY</span></strong></p>\n</div>\n<br/>\nD-1971 has spent the last two days mostly motionless, staring into the void and occasionally whispering. At 19:20 he reports having a light headache and asks Dr. Tagliani to remove SCP-082-IT. Request denied.\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">16TH DAY</span></strong></p>\n</div>\n<br/>\nThe headache evolves into an intense migraine, D-1971 isn't able to stand or autonomously use the toilet anymore; being denied again the possibility to remove SCP-082-IT, he asks for some painkillers. Request denied.\n<p><em><strong>Researcher's note:</strong> That guard looked at me like I was the devil.

The item can be used only for testing purposes, with prior authorization needed from the research coordinator. Knowing the hypothetical risks related to the use of the object, SCP-082-IT can be worn only by D-Class personnel. Given the absence of anomalous activity when not used, its containment does not require any additional safety measures.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-082-IT is a bronze helmet of Corinthian design; although its creator and origins are still unknown, thermoluminescent dating[[footnote]] Technique used in archaeology to date ceramics, bronzes, and other materials of mineral origin. [[/footnote]] traces the origin near the 8th-century BCE., at the beginning of the Archaic Greece period. As shown by repeated experiments, SCP-082-IT seemingly appears to be devoid of any anomalous properties; once worn, however, it will enter its active state.\n\n\n\nAn inscription written in Greek will appear on the front of the helmet, which reads: //\"\u039a\u03b1\u03b9 o \u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03cc\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 o \u03b4\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2\"// (//\"Both the wise and the powerful\"//, which can be interpreted as //\"The one who knows is the one who holds power\"//). The individual wearing SCP-082-IT will experience a hyperfunction of their cognitive processes, mainly affecting vigilance, ideation, memory, and intellect. The nature and intensity of these alterations vary according to the time spent on the head.\n\n\n\n* From the start of the test to 6 hours (the \"maniacal\" phase): the subjects will show hyperactivity, rapid speech and low attention span; when given freedom of choice they'll prefer to dedicate themselves to activities that require the use of creativity (i.e.: writing or drawing), switching from one to the other in a disorganized manner.\n\n\n\n* From 6 to 48 hours (the \"performative\" phase): the subject behaves more coherently and is now capable of focusing on specific activities. Standardized tests reveal an improvement in logical-mathematical, linguistic, visuospatial, and procedural intelligence performances, with every score being above average. 3-4 hours of sleep seem to be enough for adequate rest.\n\n\n\n* From 48 hours to 5 days (the \"wise\" phase): the subject reaches intellectual levels no longer measurable through tests conceived for normal human beings, being capable of learning enormous quantities of information in a very short time period and executing any task with maximum efficiency (i.e.: learning from scratch to play an instrument or solving complex mathematical equations); they also develop an eidetic memory, allowing them to remember even the most insignificant details. The need to sleep is abolished altogether.\n\n\n\n* From 5 to 7 days (the \"encyclopedic\" phase): the subject is capable of \"remembering\" information that they have never come to know before, which is virtually the entirety of human knowledge; notions are verbalized in response to specific questions but are also capable of emerging spontaneously, in the form of intrusive thoughts that interfere with the normal flow of thoughts.\n\n\u00a0\n\n* For information about longer duration tests see __Incident 082/1971__.\n\n\n\nEEG highlights an uninterrupted and increasingly higher Beta and Gamma[[footnote]] The waves registered, respectively, in normal waking and tension states. In the waking state with eyes closed the Beta waves are usually replaced with lower frequency Alpha waves.[[/footnote]] wave brain activity, even with closed eyes; sedative and hypnotic drugs have little to no effect. Part of the waves originate from SCP-082-IT itself as if they \"overwrite\" those of the host; it's therefore not clear whether SCP-082-IT merely influences the minds of others or whether it possesses some form of consciousness itself. As soon as SCP-082-IT is removed, the alterations will cease and the individual will appear confused and disoriented, reporting memory loss regarding the period of use.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 082-IT (Recovery):** SCP-082-IT was part of the private collection of [REDACTED], a rich and well-known collector of ancient artifacts, who purchased it on the black market from an unknown seller. Its anomalous properties have remained unobserved for a long period of time, until the man's child, 9 years old, decided to casually wear the helmet for fun; when the parents discovered him after several hours, the child had begun to manifest signs of an IQ far above the norm. The rumors about the \"little genius\" and the \"miraculous helmet\" reached the Foundation's agents, who then proceeded to cover up the news and confiscate SCP-082-IT.\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"\u25b6 UPDATE: Incident 082/1971\" hide=\"\u25c0\u25c0\u25c0 UPDATE: Incident 082/1971\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+ ATTENTION!\n\n**__By order of the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/organizzazione-interna Ethical-Moral Regulation Section] (SRE-M), access to the following document has been prohibited to personnel with an authorization lower than Level 4.

(83).\n\n\n\n**Objectives:** Verifying the effects of SCP-082-IT for periods longer than one week.\n\n\n\n**Setting:** D-1971 is housed in a room with everything needed to test his performance (a table, a wall blackboard, various musical instruments and a library); the room comes with an attached bathroom, while a bed is considered superfluous. As already established in previous tests, the EEG's electrodes have been installed before wearing SCP-082-IT; liquids and nutrients, given the inability to feed, are supplied intravenously. Dr. Tagliani is assisted by two security officers.\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n\n**__1ST DAY__**\n\n[[/=]]\n\nBehavior doesn't vary significantly from other subjects'. As expected, the \"maniacal\" phase is followed by the \"performative\" one. By the end of the day, D-1971's I.Q. has increased over 50%, reaching the value of 128.\n\n\n\n//**Researcher's note:** The first 6 hours have been a living hell, I've seen brats making much less of a mess. The room is full of papers smeared with attempts at abstract \"art\" and creative \"writing\". About that, I must remember to call a janitor to clean the walls.//\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n\n**__3RD DAY__**\n\n[[/=]]\n\nBeginning of the \"wise\" phase. After less than an hour spent leafing through a musical theory manual, D-1971 is capable, after a single listening, of executing an error-free performance by ear of Korsakov's //Flight of the Bumblebee// for piano. After being invited to choose a book from the library, D-1971 hesitates in front of Wittgenstein's //Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus//, only to discard it in favor of a series of volumes in the math section. In the late afternoon, D-1971 has now bridged the gap with more educated subjects and approaches the study of advanced texts.\n\n\n\n//**Researcher's note:** It's alienating to see a person juggling between formulas and theorems that, not even two days ago, would have caused nothing more than a blank face. The variety of choices of the subjects leads me to think that the helmet is a catalyst for certain unexpressed tendencies. I wonder if, in another life, D-1971 would have been a successful pianist or mathematician. Right now I'll allow him to continue; who knows if something interesting will come out of it.//\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n\n**__4TH DAY__**\n\n[[/=]]\n\nAt 2:37 A.M., D-1971 suddenly leaves his books and rushes to the blackboard, writing down a series of mathematical formulas; he stops just before sunrise, contemplating the results of his calculations, only to erase everything and start all over again. This happens multiple times in the following hours at irregular intervals.\n\n\n\nAt 15:13, D-1971 declares himself satisfied and announces that he has come up with the formulation of a theorem that confirms the Riemann hypothesis[[footnote]] One of the \"Millennium Prizes Problems\" (seven unsolved mathematical problems), related to a function that should reflect the distribution of prime numbers. [[/footnote]].\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n\n**__9TH DAY__**\n\n[[/=]]\n\nDespite the appearance of the intrusive thoughts typical of the \"encyclopedic\" phase, D-1971 has decided to keep focusing on mathematical problems. It has been about two days longer than the longest test previously conducted.\n\n> **<Start of the Log>**\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Tagliani:** Good morning, D-1971.\n\n> \n\n> **D-1971:** //[Intent to copy from a sheet of paper onto the blackboard]// Hyv\u00e4\u00e4 huomenta paskiainen.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Tagliani:** Excuse me?\n\n> \n\n> **D-1971:** I've said \"good morning\" in Finnish. Don't ask me how I know that, I just do.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Tagliani:** //[Writing in his notebook]// Interesting, the more this phase goes on, the more complex the acquired knowledge becomes. Anyway... you'll be pleased to know I've received the verification of your calculations[[footnote]] Performed by a selected team of mathematicians and confirmed by S5-2. [[/footnote]] and it seems that everything's right. Even your theory about the Navier\u2013Stokes equations seems to be correct, the eggheads from [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/siti-italiani#Sito-Vulcano Site Vulcano] almost wetted themselves from joy.\n\n> \n\n> **D-1971:** Mere formalities, I'm more than certain about the accuracy of my calculations.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Tagliani:** How is your work proceeding?\n\n> \n\n> **D-1971:** I'm one step away from solving the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Tagliani:** It's been 12 hours since the last infusion. Are you sure you don't really need a break?\n\n> \n\n> **D-1971:** Never felt better, doctor. The only problems are those guards: they've been talking out loud all morning and that's keeping me from focusing.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Tagliani:** I'll ask them to be quieter.\n\n> \n\n> **D-1971:** Here, can you hear them? They've started again, I can't work in these conditions!\n\n> \n\n> //Dr. Tagliani turns towards the guards. Both are completely silent.//\n\n> \n\n> **<End of the Log>**\n\n//**Researcher's note:** They said again and again that adding this much time to the test was useless, but they were damn wrong! I have to name this new stage; \"telepathic\" phase will do, I'm all about simplicity.//\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n\n**__11TH DAY__**\n\n[[/=]]\n\nThe intrusive thoughts, just as the mind-reading incidents, get more and more frequent; all the personnel within a 200 m radius of the room is equipped with an Inibipathic shielding system[[footnote]] An wearable headgear developed by the Italian Branch capable of shielding from the influence of low and medium power psychic anomalies. [[/footnote]]. D-1971's mental readiness seems to be partially affected by this; furthermore, it seems that the subject is gradually losing interest in those same activities he previously was enthusiast about.\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n\n**__13TH DAY__**\n\n[[/=]]\n\nD-1971 interrupts his own research, refusing to continue; he also makes a feeble attempt to remove SCP-082-IT from his head, but he's immediately restrained. The deep apathetic state experienced by D-1971 is considered to be the beginning of a new stage, the \"nihilistic\" phase; Dr. Tagliani makes him wear a straitjacket to prevent other acts of defiance.\n\n> **<Start of the Log>**\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Tagliani:** I don't understand, D-1971. In a matter of days, you achieved something that many wouldn't be able to do in a lifetime. What\u2019s stopping you now?\n\n> \n\n> **D-1971:** //[In a flat tone]// For what purpose, doctor? It's pointless to keep on writing and writing and writing. This infernal helmet gives me every answer to every question within a few milliseconds. Theory of Everything? Nothing more than a child's nursery rhyme. Cure for cancer? It's baffling how they still haven't got it. Reality is an open book; the thing is, no one before me had the right lens to read it.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Tagliani:** //[Getting upset]// Even more so! Think about what we could achieve with similar knowledge in the right hands.\n\n> \n\n> **D-1971:** //Right// hands, doctor? Yours, you mean? Or the Superintendence's hands, perhaps? Oh right, about that, I know everything there's to know about your dear Foundation, the helmet whispers it to me constantly. I know about all the deaths, the lab rats that came before me, and those that will come after me, I know about all the horrible things you do to contain your monsters, I even know what you're hiding there, [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-001-it-graf in that old castle]. And you know what the best part is? You seriously believe you're doing it for the greater good.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Tagliani:** [EXPLICIT] the greater good! We're talking about science, this philosophical [EXPLICIT]...\n\n> \n\n> **D-1971:** \"... is not the reason why I'm here\". You can remove that ridiculous hat, I can still hear you either way. Actually I can hear all of you, but your voices aren't so annoying anymore, I tend to ignore them, truth be told. What is the useless babbling of inferior minds for those who can listen to the universe itself singing inside their eardrums?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Tagliani:** This conversation\u2026\n\n> \n\n> **D-1971:** ...is over. I know, doctor, I know //everything//, even if I'd like not to.\n\n> \n\n> **<End of Log>**\n\n//**Researcher's note:** I'm tempted to end the experiment, remove the helmet, give it to the next subject and start all over. However, there's more, I can feel it. It's better not to let anyone know, for now, that D-1971 has access to sensitive information. I'd just risk getting someone in the way.//\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n\n**__15TH DAY__**\n\n[[/=]]\n\nD-1971 has spent the last two days mostly motionless, staring into the void and occasionally whispering. At 19:20 he reports having a light headache and asks Dr. Tagliani to remove SCP-082-IT. Request denied.\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n\n**__16TH DAY__**\n\n[[/=]]\n\nThe headache evolves into an intense migraine, D-1971 isn't able to stand or autonomously use the toilet anymore; being denied again the possibility to remove SCP-082-IT, he asks for some painkillers. Request denied.\n\n\n\n//**Researcher's note:** That guard looked at me like I was the devil. We're dealing with an anomaly that alters the neurological balance; I can't invalidate the data by providing medications.//\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n\n**__17TH DAY__**\n\n[[/=]]\n\nAfter hours of screams and pleas from D-1971, Dr. Tagliani administers some intravenous analgesic, without effects of any sort. D-1971, prey to a convulsive crisis, is tied to a stretcher to prevent him from hurting himself.\n\n\n\n//**Researcher's note:** I had to give in. It's only a matter of time before one of the gorillas goes behind my back and contacts the SRE-M.

Histological examinations revealed it is composed entirely of neuroectoderm[[footnote]] The embryonic tissue from which the nervous system and other cell types originate. [[/footnote]] and DNA tests revealed it to be a 100% genetic match with the late D-1971; an \"umbilical cord\" and \"amniotic sac\" were respectively identified as a bundle of nerves and meningeal fibers containing cerebrospinal fluid. Death was probably caused by the trauma of the fall.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe report seems to confirm that SCP-082-IT-1 developed from D-1971's brain mass. Therefore, SCP-082-IT possesses, besides mind-altering properties, the ability to redirect neuronal cells' development in an anomalous way.\n\nSCP-082-IT-1 has been preserved in formaldehyde.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n**Addendum 082/1971:** Final extract from Dr. Filippo Tagliani's personal notes.\n\n\n\n> //What happened is incredible. After so many years spent working with anomalies, I'd have never expected something that could still surprise me.

SCP-088-PT is to be constantly monitored and contained within a 4m\u00b3 containment chamber on Site-PT33, inside a standard container for inanimate objects. As it is impossible to load the object with ammunition, SCP-088-PT requires only standard maintenance and hygiene procedures while in its inactive state.</p>\n<p>Upon indication of the occurrence of an 088-\u03a3 Event, it is to be assumed that SCP-088-PT has entered its active state and that SCP-088-PT-1 will appear in exactly 2 minutes to equip SCP-088-PT. Those responsible for this observation are to alert all personnel involved in containment through the on-site standard communications systems that an 088-\u03a3 Event has begun (for more information regarding 088-\u03a3 Events, personnel with a Security Clearance Level 3/088 may refer to Document 088-01).</p>\n<p>STF PT22-\u0393 is responsible for the establishment of a 500m perimeter around SCP-088-PT. This perimeter must not contain any individual that placed in any region to the left of the y-axis as determined by the Foundation Test for Political Coordinates (for more information regarding the test, personnel with a Security Clearance Level 3/088 may refer to Document 088-02). All personnel within the perimeter must be trained to react efficiently to the protocols of an 088-\u03a3 Event. STF PT22-\u0393 is authorised to investigate and repel any efforts to violate SCP-088-PT's containment, and to employ lethal force in the case that it is necessary to maintain containment.</p>\n<p>Upon the occurrence of an 088-\u03a3 Event, individuals within the perimeter must safely conclude or halt their current activities and salute; if approached by SCP-088-PT-1, personnel are to address the entity as \"Sergeant Rocha\", and treat the entity with all the conventions of this title. The 088-\u03a3 Event will only be considered concluded when a new communication announces the dematerialisation of SCP-088-PT-1.</p>\n<p>No personnel may enter SCP-088-PT's containment chamber during an 088-\u03a3 event or within 6 hours after its conclusion.</p>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:500px;\"><img alt=\"SCP-088-PT.jpg\" class=\"image\" src=\"http://scp-pt-br.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-088-pt/SCP-088-PT.jpg\" style=\"width:500px;\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width:500px;\">\n<p>SCP-088-PT in its inactive state.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-088-PT is a semi-automatic rifle M1 Garand approximately dated to the 1960s, with a mass of 4.2\u00a0kg and a length of 1.1m. The rifle has been modified to shoot .458 calibre Winchester ammunition.</p>\n<p>In its inactive state, SCP-088-PT does not differ from an ordinary M1 Garand rifle. However, when the object is activated, its appearance is spontaneously modified following an apparently random period of time. No means to prevent or control this process are currently known.</p>\n<p>In its active state, SCP-088-PT appears as an extremely deteriorated firearm with damage consistent with a weapon used excessively in combat without proper maintenance. A roughly carved phrase will appear in its stock, reading \"THIS MACHINE KILLS COMMIES\"; in addition, several marks are carved into the rifle apparently counting the number of individuals terminated by SCP-088-PT. However, according to information obtained by Dr. Nascimento in interviews with 088-PT-1, the actual number of neutralised individuals is closer to [REDACTED].</p>\n<p>SCP-088-PT-1 denotes the entity that is manifested when SCP-088-PT is activated. SCP-088-PT-1 is identical in appearance to a male human, dressed in a uniform traditionally worn by the soldiers that comprised the For\u00e7a Expedicion\u00e1ria Brasileira (FEB, or Brazilian Expeditionary Force) during the Second World War. SCP-088-PT-1 appears to be approximately 40 years of age, with a tanned complexion, voluminous moustache and beard, and dishevelled hair.</p>\n<p>SCP-088-PT-1 is able to interact physically with its surroundings and environment despite being completely incorporeal. X-rays, thermographic equipment, and other methods of detection thus far utilised by the Foundation are unable to detect the entity. SCP-088-PT-1 considers itself the \"owner\" of SCP-088-PT and is the only individual capable of appropriately utilising the object. When equipped by SCP-088-PT-1, SCP-088-PT also becomes incorporeal.</p>\n<p>SCP-088-PT-1 is capable of using SCP-088-PT as an ordinary M1 Garand rifle; however, it has never been seen to reload the weapon, generating projectiles apparently without source or trace. The projectiles fired from SCP-088-PT are not propelled by powder or made of lead, but rather appear to be completely incorporeal and propelled by an unknown force. Therefore, targets shot by SCP-088-PT rarely survive their injuries.</p>\n<p>It is theorised that SCP-088-PT-1 is identical in appearance to the late Sergeant \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Rocha, as he resided in the same location where SCP-088-PT was originally discovered. Additional data has been catalogued by Dr. Nascimento derived from a diary found in [DATA EXPUNGED].

An 088-\u03a3 event happens sporadically and irregularly when these conditions are met. Researchers are still trying to decipher a pattern for these seemingly random occurrences of 088-\u03a3 Events.</p>\n<p>During 088-\u03a3 Events, SCP-088-PT-1 behaves similarly to how an actual drill sergeant would act when inspecting soldiers, a behaviour which masquerades its intention to search for any individual with left-leaning tendencies within the aforementioned 500m perimeter. When identified by SCP-088-PT-1, such an individual will be promptly executed via the use of SCP-088-PT; SCP-088-PT will, without exception, label the individual as \"a filthy commie\", even if the target did not technically have left-wing beliefs that corresponded to communism. Those attempting to defend people attacked by SCP-088-PT-1 will be regarded in the same manner and be similarly targeted. The Foundation currently does not understand how SCP-088-PT-1 detects the political affiliation of individuals within the perimeter.</p>\n<p>Those without a left-leaning political bias have little to no risk while interacting with SCP-088-PT-1, so long as they treat it as their hierarchically superior military officer, do not possess objects or a demeanour that leads to SCP-088-PT-1 suspecting of such a bias, and do not attempt to help those attacked by SCP-088-PT-1. Failure to maintain these protocols will result in targeting by SCP-088-PT-1.</p>\n<p>SCP-088-PT-1 is able to teleport instantaneously to any location within the established 500m perimeter (an action performed frequently during the object's active state). It is effectively impossible to track SCP-088-PT-1 or block its entrance from any specific location within the perimeter. In addition, SCP-088-PT-1 is capable of changing the epicenter of the aforementioned perimeter to its current position. However, such an occurrence has only been observed when SCP-088-PT-1 had to pursue one of its targets past the 500m radius.</p>\n<p>SCP-088-PT-1 will always complete its pursuit at Dr. Nascimento's office (one of the personnel responsible for the containment of SCP-088-PT), after speaking with every human being within the established perimeter and executing those that did not conform to the mentioned parameters. SCP-088-PT-1 will leave SCP-088-PT to his care, as it considers him the \"most-competent subordinate available\".

The ordinated (y) axis determines how authoritarian or libertarian the individual that performed the test is, the abscissae (x) axis determines whether the individual is left-leaning or right-leaning. The intersection point of the lines is thus the point of origin.</p>\n<p>Due to the nature of SCP-088-PT, personnel that report a negative score in the abscissae axis must not participate in any way in the containment of SCP-088-PT, as detailed above. The score in the ordinated axis is irrelevant for the containment of SCP-088-PT.</p>\n<p>The questions for the tests required to determine the political orientation of an individual may be accessed in Document 088-\u2588\u2588.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">-\u00a0Access\u00a0Granted.</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Addendum 088-01 - Discovery:</strong> SCP-088-PT was discovered in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Minas Gerais, Brazil by a driver that passed through the apparently deserted city; shortly thereafter, finding several corpses.</p>\n<p>The anomaly was located by the Foundation after agents infiltrating the PMMG (Pol\u00edcia Militar de Minas Gerais, or Minas Gerais State Military Police) reported the new 088-\u03a3 Events that were triggered during police investigation. The Foundation, with new information about the anomalous effects of SCP-088-PT, managed to contain the object without further incidents.</p>\n<p>The proximity of Site PT33 to the city of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 decreased the probability of new 088-\u03a3 Events occurring during the transportation of the object to containment.

SCP-088-PT is to be constantly monitored and contained within a 4m\u00b3 containment chamber on Site-PT33, inside a standard container for inanimate objects. As it is impossible to load the object with ammunition, SCP-088-PT requires only standard maintenance and hygiene procedures while in its inactive state.\n\n\n\nUpon indication of the occurrence of an 088-\u03a3 Event, it is to be assumed that SCP-088-PT has entered its active state and that SCP-088-PT-1 will appear in exactly 2 minutes to equip SCP-088-PT. Those responsible for this observation are to alert all personnel involved in containment through the on-site standard communications systems that an 088-\u03a3 Event has begun (for more information regarding 088-\u03a3 Events, personnel with a Security Clearance Level 3/088 may refer to Document 088-01).\n\n\n\nSTF PT22-\u0393 is responsible for the establishment of a 500m perimeter around SCP-088-PT. This perimeter must not contain any individual that placed in any region to the left of the y-axis as determined by the Foundation Test for Political Coordinates (for more information regarding the test, personnel with a Security Clearance Level 3/088 may refer to Document 088-02). All personnel within the perimeter must be trained to react efficiently to the protocols of an 088-\u03a3 Event. STF PT22-\u0393 is authorised to investigate and repel any efforts to violate SCP-088-PT's containment, and to employ lethal force in the case that it is necessary to maintain containment.\n\n\n\nUpon the occurrence of an 088-\u03a3 Event, individuals within the perimeter must safely conclude or halt their current activities and salute; if approached by SCP-088-PT-1, personnel are to address the entity as \"Sergeant Rocha\", and treat the entity with all the conventions of this title. The 088-\u03a3 Event will only be considered concluded when a new communication announces the dematerialisation of SCP-088-PT-1.\n\n\n\nNo personnel may enter SCP-088-PT's containment chamber during an 088-\u03a3 event or within 6 hours after its conclusion.\n\n\n\n------\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> name=http://scp-pt-br.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-088-pt/SCP-088-PT.jpg|align=center|width=500px|caption=SCP-088-PT in its inactive state.]]\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-088-PT is a semi-automatic rifle M1 Garand approximately dated to the 1960s, with a mass of 4.2 kg and a length of 1.1m. The rifle has been modified to shoot .458 calibre Winchester ammunition.\n\n\n\nIn its inactive state, SCP-088-PT does not differ from an ordinary M1 Garand rifle. However, when the object is activated, its appearance is spontaneously modified following an apparently random period of time. No means to prevent or control this process are currently known.\n\n\n\nIn its active state, SCP-088-PT appears as an extremely deteriorated firearm with damage consistent with a weapon used excessively in combat without proper maintenance. A roughly carved phrase will appear in its stock, reading \"THIS MACHINE KILLS COMMIES\"; in addition, several marks are carved into the rifle apparently counting the number of individuals terminated by SCP-088-PT. However, according to information obtained by Dr. Nascimento in interviews with 088-PT-1, the actual number of neutralised individuals is closer to [REDACTED].\n\n\n\nSCP-088-PT-1 denotes the entity that is manifested when SCP-088-PT is activated. SCP-088-PT-1 is identical in appearance to a male human, dressed in a uniform traditionally worn by the soldiers that comprised the For\u00e7a Expedicion\u00e1ria Brasileira (FEB, or Brazilian Expeditionary Force) during the Second World War. SCP-088-PT-1 appears to be approximately 40 years of age, with a tanned complexion, voluminous moustache and beard, and dishevelled hair.\n\n\n\nSCP-088-PT-1 is able to interact physically with its surroundings and environment despite being completely incorporeal. X-rays, thermographic equipment, and other methods of detection thus far utilised by the Foundation are unable to detect the entity. SCP-088-PT-1 considers itself the \"owner\" of SCP-088-PT and is the only individual capable of appropriately utilising the object. When equipped by SCP-088-PT-1, SCP-088-PT also becomes incorporeal.\n\n\n\nSCP-088-PT-1 is capable of using SCP-088-PT as an ordinary M1 Garand rifle; however, it has never been seen to reload the weapon, generating projectiles apparently without source or trace. The projectiles fired from SCP-088-PT are not propelled by powder or made of lead, but rather appear to be completely incorporeal and propelled by an unknown force. Therefore, targets shot by SCP-088-PT rarely survive their injuries.\n\n\n\nIt is theorised that SCP-088-PT-1 is identical in appearance to the late Sergeant \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Rocha, as he resided in the same location where SCP-088-PT was originally discovered. Additional data has been catalogued by Dr. Nascimento derived from a diary found in [DATA EXPUNGED]. For more information, refer to Document [REDACTED].\n\n\n\nDetails regarding SCP-088-PT-1's behaviour may be accessed by personnel with a Security Clearance Level 3/088 in Document 088-01.\n\n\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ Document 088-01: Security Clearance Level 3/088 is required to access these files.\" hide=\"- Access granted.\"]]\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[div style=\"background: url(http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat ; float: center; border: solid 2px #000000; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n\n+ WARNING: THE FOLLOWING FILE IS CONFIDENTIAL AND CLASSIFIED AS 01/088.\n\n----\n\n+++ ATTEMPTS TO ACCESS THIS FILE WITHOUT LEVEL 3/088 AUTHORISATION WILL BE REGISTERED AND WILL RESULT IN A DISCIPLINARY ACTION.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n**Preface:** The following document depicts the extension of the Foundation's knowledge regarding the nature of SCP-088-PT, SCP-088-PT-1 and 088-\u03a3 Events.\n\n\n\n**Document 088-01:** An 088-\u03a3 Event comprises the observation of the deterioration of SCP-088-PT and the subsequent appearance of SCP-088-PT-1. --What triggers these events is currently unknown-- These events are triggered by the introduction of a politically-left-leaning individual within a 500m radius of SCP-088-PT. An 088-\u03a3 event happens sporadically and irregularly when these conditions are met. Researchers are still trying to decipher a pattern for these seemingly random occurrences of 088-\u03a3 Events.\n\n\n\nDuring 088-\u03a3 Events, SCP-088-PT-1 behaves similarly to how an actual drill sergeant would act when inspecting soldiers, a behaviour which masquerades its intention to search for any individual with left-leaning tendencies within the aforementioned 500m perimeter. When identified by SCP-088-PT-1, such an individual will be promptly executed via the use of SCP-088-PT; SCP-088-PT will, without exception, label the individual as \"a filthy commie\", even if the target did not technically have left-wing beliefs that corresponded to communism. Those attempting to defend people attacked by SCP-088-PT-1 will be regarded in the same manner and be similarly targeted. The Foundation currently does not understand how SCP-088-PT-1 detects the political affiliation of individuals within the perimeter.\n\n\n\nThose without a left-leaning political bias have little to no risk while interacting with SCP-088-PT-1, so long as they treat it as their hierarchically superior military officer, do not possess objects or a demeanour that leads to SCP-088-PT-1 suspecting of such a bias, and do not attempt to help those attacked by SCP-088-PT-1. Failure to maintain these protocols will result in targeting by SCP-088-PT-1.\n\n\n\nSCP-088-PT-1 is able to teleport instantaneously to any location within the established 500m perimeter (an action performed frequently during the object's active state). It is effectively impossible to track SCP-088-PT-1 or block its entrance from any specific location within the perimeter. In addition, SCP-088-PT-1 is capable of changing the epicenter of the aforementioned perimeter to its current position. However, such an occurrence has only been observed when SCP-088-PT-1 had to pursue one of its targets past the 500m radius.\n\n\n\nSCP-088-PT-1 will always complete its pursuit at Dr. Nascimento's office (one of the personnel responsible for the containment of SCP-088-PT), after speaking with every human being within the established perimeter and executing those that did not conform to the mentioned parameters. SCP-088-PT-1 will leave SCP-088-PT to his care, as it considers him the \"most-competent subordinate available\". Dr. Nascimento --must be present in his office during 088-\u03a3 Events-- is responsible for transporting SCP-088-PT back to its containment chamber following the conclusion of an 088-\u03a3 Event. When any human that is not Dr. Nascimento enters the containment chamber during this period, a new 088-\u03a3 Event will be initiated, and the perpetrator subsequently eliminated.\n\n\n\n--If Dr. Nascimento is not present in his office during the conclusion of an 088-\u03a3\u00a0\u00a0Event, SCP-088-PT-1 will become hostile, attacking [DATA EXPUNGED]-- On 20/12/20\u2588\u2588, Dr. Nascimento entered into an agreement between himself and SCP-088-PT-1: SCP-088-PT was to be left on his desk in the case of his absence; no other individual may touch SCP-088-PT or a new 088-\u03a3 Event will be initiated, resulting in the manifestation of a new perimeter around the object, and the subsequent elimination of the perpetrator. Dr. Nascimento remains the only individual allowed to enter SCP-088-PT's containment chamber during the six hours following the conclusion of an 088-\u03a3 Event.\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ Document 088-02: Security Clearance Level 3/088 is required to access these files.\" hide=\"- Access Granted.\"]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[div style=\"background: url(http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat ; float: center; border: solid 2px #000000; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n\n+ WARNING: THE FOLLOWING FILE IS CONFIDENTIAL AND UNDER 02/088 CLASSIFICATION\n\n----\n\n+++ ATTEMPTS TO ACCESS THIS FILE WITHOUT LEVEL 3/088 AUTHORISATION WILL BE REGISTERED AND WILL RESULT IN DISCIPLINARY ACTION.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> name=http://scp-pt-br.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-088-pt/politica2english.png| caption=A simplified example result from the Foundation Test for Political Coordinates.]]\n\n\n\n**Preface**: Document 088-02 details the Foundation Test for Political Coordinates developed by Dr. Mirtes and Dr. Nascimento.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Document 088-02**: The Foundation Test for Political Coordinates consists of a series of questions specifically formulated by Dr. Mirtes under the supervision of Dr. Nascimento, and based on several studies of [DATA EXPUNGED]; at this moment, it is the most-effective test to determine the political bias/orientation of a human being, having a success rate of \u2588\u2588.\u2588%.\n\n\n\nThe complete results of the test are extraordinarily complex for personnel without specific knowledge in mathematics and political science to understand; thus, a simple representation in a Cartesian coordinate system has been created, an image of which has been attached to this document. The ordinated (y) axis determines how authoritarian or libertarian the individual that performed the test is, the abscissae (x) axis determines whether the individual is left-leaning or right-leaning. The intersection point of the lines is thus the point of origin.\n\n\n\nDue to the nature of SCP-088-PT, personnel that report a negative score in the abscissae axis must not participate in any way in the containment of SCP-088-PT, as detailed above. The score in the ordinated axis is irrelevant for the containment of SCP-088-PT.\n\n\n\nThe questions for the tests required to determine the political orientation of an individual may be accessed in Document 088-\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n**Addendum 088-01 - Discovery:** SCP-088-PT was discovered in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Minas Gerais, Brazil by a driver that passed through the apparently deserted city; shortly thereafter, finding several corpses.\n\n\n\nThe anomaly was located by the Foundation after agents infiltrating the PMMG (Pol\u00edcia Militar de Minas Gerais, or Minas Gerais State Military Police) reported the new 088-\u03a3 Events that were triggered during police investigation. The Foundation, with new information about the anomalous effects of SCP-088-PT, managed to contain the object without further incidents.\n\n\n\nThe proximity of Site PT33 to the city of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 decreased the probability of new 088-\u03a3 Events occurring during the transportation of the object to containment. The surviving civilians that witnessed SCP-088-PT-1 were administered Class-B amnestics.\n\n\n\nIt is theorised that several 088-\u03a3 Events occurred sequentially due a political rally led by a notorious left-leaning Brazilian political party in the city, leading to the annihilation of all human life in a radius of approximately \u2588\u2588\u2588 kilometres. The city of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 had 5,830 inhabitants prior to the occurrence of the event, with only 1,627 surviving.

Maintenance operations are to be performed by 20 workers specially trained in wooden household maintenance. The workers are strictly forbidden to enter the attic.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-100-JP is a wooden two-story house with an attic, found in Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, Mexico. The original owner of the building was \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Following his death, the house was left with without proprietors.</p>\n<p>The first and second floor of SCP-100-JP are rooms with no anomalous qualities. However, the attic, which is accessible by a ladder located on the second floor, contains a space with an interior size far exceeding that of the building's exterior. This space exists in a completely non-gravitational and vacuum state. Investigation of the space via drones has revealed that the space extends for 127\u00a0km in either direction. Owing to the fact that wooden \u201cwalls\u201d extend in all directions and disappear into the horizon, this space appears to be warped. Following Incident 100-2, attempts to destroy the \u201cwalls\u201d are strictly forbidden.</p>\n<p>The space inside the attic in SCP-100-JP contains vast amounts of \u201cheavenly bodies\u201d consisting of wooden material seemingly derived from various furniture. The \u201cplanets\u201d are about 10\u00a0cm in diameter, and \u201cfixed stars\u201d with light bulbs inserted are far more enormous. The source of wood, light bulbs and power supply to light the bulbs are still undetermined. Moreover, the \u201cheavenly bodies\u201d crumble even at a slight touch.</p>\n<p>Foundation astronomers have discovered that the circumstances of these \u201cheavenly bodies\u201d correspond with those in our universe at the present time. It has been proven that damage dealt to the \u201cheavenly bodies\u201d correspondingly damages the actual heavenly bodies they represent, and damage dealt to the \u201cwalls\u201d will equally damage the \"fabric of space\". Because of these traits, experiments within SCP-100-JP are strictly forbidden (See also Incident 100-1, Incident 100-2).</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Incident 100-1</span><br/>\nIn \u2588/\u2588/19\u2588\u2588, when a research team led by Foundation astronomers entered SCP-100-JP to investigate the space in detail, a researcher mistakenly destroyed a \u201cstar\u201d inside SCP-100-JP. \u2588\u2588 years later in \u2588/\u2588\u2588/20\u2588\u2588, the star \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 near the constellation Taurus suddenly went supernova, despite its young stellar age. Immediately after this incident was observed by Foundation astronomers, SCP-100-JP, formerly thought of as an object simply mimicking heavenly bodies, was classified as a Euclid-class object. \u201cPlanets\u201d and \u201cstars\u201d destroyed by minor contact during surveys of SCP-100-JP numbered more than 1\u2588. Fortunately, all of these \u201cheavenly bodies\u201d destroyed were located far away from the \u201cplanet\u201d resembling Earth, and it was estimated that the incidents would cause no harm to life on Earth.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Incident 100-2</span><br/>\nIn \u2588/\u2588\u2588/200\u2588, some parts of SCP-100-JP collapsed due to an earthquake, resulting in holes in walls of the attic and many \u201cheavenly bodies\u201d destroyed.

The cabinet must be guarded by two armed security officers at all times. Access to the facility is allowed only with the written permission of Dr. Theomant and under constant supervision of at least one employee of Level 4 clearance.</p>\n<p>SCP-1040 should be loaded with blank cartridges only, as firing it with live cartridges will damage the integral muzzle.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-1040 is a modified Dragunov sniper rifle. Changes made to the original design are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The muzzle consists of glass, ceramics, and metal; its principle of operation is unknown, and it is not removable.</li>\n<li>The scope has been replaced with one of unknown origin and model; all objects seen through this scope are visible, coloured in blue; however, objects that have been \"hit\" by SCP-1040 are coloured in red.</li>\n<li>The manufacturer's information has been replaced by the words \"Made by Lefty\".</li>\n</ul>\n<p>According to the instructions found alongside the object, SCP-1040 \"spoils\" or \"damages\" anyone who is shot with a blank cartridge. After firing while using the scope, the user can observe a red dot moving at great speeds towards the target. When said dot collides with a creature or object, its colour changes to red inside the scope. Without a scope, there are no observable effects.</p>\n<p>Any living creature affected by SCP-1040 dies within 24 hours, usually as a result of an accident, but sometimes, under certain circumstances, from a heart attack or stroke. Any inanimate object, including the terrain surrounding the place of the spot's collision with the subject, will become \"ill-fated\" for about 48 hours. Unpleasant accidents occur regularly in their proximity, such as the loss of small objects etc. As time passes, this effect gradually decreases in severity.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 1:</strong> These are the user instructions found during the recovery of the object:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Almost everyone knows someone that they want to kill. Don't you?</em><br/>\n<em>Well, why wouldn't you? Uh\u2026 You don't want to go to jail\u2026</em><br/>\n<em>Well, what if everything looks like it happened with no relation to you?</em><br/>\n<em>Load this thing with a blank cartridge, aim and pull the trigger and, well, everything will happen by itself.</em><br/>\n<em>With love, Lefty.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Addendum 2:</strong> The object was seized from the contract-killer [DATA EXPUNGED]. Initially, it went into the possession of local law enforcement agencies, before Foundation employees discovered it.

By attaching a picture or a photo onto the hanging scroll, a person will be able to \"enter\" it. The person in the image will be displayed as a figure appropriate for the style of the image.

Video and audio data containing recordings of the human voice will have the qualities of the recorded voice change to that of an entirely different person. (The affected data is termed the \"subject\".)

Initial containment consisted of deletion of the subjects and the use of the cover story \"pitch changes due to corruption of audio data\"; however, as the prevalence of SCP-1139-JP gradually increased, Project 1139-JP was created with the help of the Audio Research Team of the Foundation's Japanese branch, consisting of the development of a specialized vocal synthesis software and the use of a new cover story involving it.</p>\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#f0f8ff; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Project 1139-JP</strong></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Project 1139-JP is composed of the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Development of a new version of existing vocal synthesis software.</li>\n<li>Selection and voice recording of a person with voice similar to SCP-1139-A.</li>\n<li>Apply effects to the voice data such that it resembles that of an SCP-1139-JP subject as closely as possible.</li>\n<li>Release the created software (designated SCP-1139-JP-\u03b1) to the public.</li>\n<li>Upon further occurrence of SCP-1139-JP, the cover story \"work using SCP-1139-JP-\u03b1\" can be used and any associated individuals can be amnesticized.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If changes in the properties of SCP-1139-JP occurrences are observed, Project 1139-JP is to be updated and amended accordingly.</p>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-right\" style=\"width:300px;\"><img alt=\"%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AA%E3%83%97%E3%83%88%E3%83%B3%E7%A4%BE.jpg\" class=\"image\" src=\"http://scp-int.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-1139-jp/%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AA%E3%83%97%E3%83%88%E3%83%B3%E7%A4%BE.jpg\" style=\"width:300px;\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width:300px;\">\n<p>The building housing the offices of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a company involved in the creation of SCP-1139-JP-\u03b1.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Over the course of one year, the Foundation worked with \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, companies developing related software to develop a new version of the software and select a voice actor with similar vocal qualities to that of SCP-1139-JP-A. This was considered an acceptable time frame for the creation of SCP-1139-JP-\u03b1.</p>\n<p>Although SCP-1139-JP-\u03b1 was unable to consistently produce ideal results, the rate of occurrence of SCP-1139-JP had been observed to be increasing slowly but quadratically. However, as it was determined that SCP-1139-JP-\u03b1 was able to produce ideal results when used correctly, SCP-1139-JP-\u03b1 was released in its imperfect state, with updated versions to be produced later.</p>\n<p>After adjustments were conducted through a front company, SCP-1139-JP-\u03b1 was released as a commercial product of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Following this, sales of SCP-1139-JP-\u03b1 far exceeded original expectations, and Project 1139-JP proceeded at an accelerated pace. Due to its unexpected popularity, the Foundation's Distribution Department is currently conducting research into possible related anomalies. It has been suggested that SCP-1139-JP's anomalous nature may be responsible for SCP-1139-JP-\u03b1's unprecedented increase in popularity; however, as SCP-1139-JP-\u03b1 and related work constitutes a major source of income for Foundation front companies, attempts to prevent continued work on SCP-1139-JP-\u03b1 are prohibited.</p>\n<p>Due to the nickname given by users to the SCP-1139-JP-\u03b1 image character \"\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\"<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>, henceforth referred to as SCP-1139-JP-\u03b1-1, Project 1139-JP was given the codename \"Utahime\"<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup>. Due to the remarkable spread of SCP-1139-JP-\u03b1, Project \"Utahime\" has been determined to be satisfactorily completed. However, as the possibility of an information breach of SCP-1139-JP due to a decline in the use of SCP-1139-JP-\u03b1 cannot be ruled out, new versions of SCP-1139-JP-\u03b1 are continuously being developed.</p>\n<p>On 20\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588, during investigation into the research facilities used by Tokiwa \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (PoI-831) to produce and distribute anomalous computer programs, several points of information thought to relate to SCP-1139-JP were discovered, including a diary belonging to an unknown individual. On the last page of the diary, an L-size photograph was discovered, depicting a young female (henceforth SCP-1139-JP-A-1) on an intravenous drip lying in what is thought to be a hospital bed; because of this, SCP-1139-JP-A-1 is thought to be the author of the diary. Based on an analysis of the skeletal structure of the person in the photo, there is a 78.2% chance that SCP-1139-JP-A-1 is the same person as SCP-1139-JP-A. In addition, based on the information in the diary, SCP-1139-JP-A-1 had used the name \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 in events prior to her passing.</p>\n<p>The following attached document, Document 1139-JP-82439, consists of extracts from this diary.

After all, it's embarrassing when you go off tune, isn't it?

Quite simple, really.</p>\n<p>I thought of another song today\u2026 I've got to hurry up and write it. I don't want to end up thinking \"oh, I wish I'd finished this in the hospital\". Even under these circumstances, being able to come up with a feel-good prayer song\u2026 I'm so proud of myself.</p>\n<p>This song is great!

Though what that self is, I don't know. I've heard that when you hold your lover's hand or kiss someone you hold dear, you feel a little younger\u2026 is that what this is?</p>\n<p>The kind of love that makes you want to stay by your sweetheart's side, so you know the new, true version of them?<br/>\nIf you're able to love from the soul, even deeper than the bottom of your heart, no matter what happens you'll always be able to stay with the one you love.

Though it may just be a detail, these little things changed my mood too. Grabbing onto these feelings, I started to hum a phrase that seemed to convey my feelings. If you put the words in your heart on it, you'll surely be able to show the full picture of your feelings. Well, it's easy to say, but\u2026</p>\n<p>Songs can connect these disconnected emotions into a coherent composition better than people's words can.

Assigned personnel are to monitor SCP-1139-JP manifestations. Upon confirmation of SCP-1139-JP manifestation, deletion and amnesticization of related individuals are to be carried out, and the cover story of \"artistic work using SCP-1139-JP-\u03b1\" is to be used.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-1139-JP is an anomalous phenomenon affecting video and audio data uploaded to the internet. Video and audio data containing recordings of the human voice will have the qualities of the recorded voice change to that of an entirely different person. (The affected data is termed the \"subject\".) This phenomenon affects recordings of singing; however, the criteria for data to be affected are currently unknown.\n\n\n\nHumans (hereafter referred to as \"listeners\") who listen to the recordings perceive them as \"songs sung by \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\". --However, there is no person with the name \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.-- As there is no information relating to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 in textual descriptions associated with the subject, there is a possibility that this is some form of infohazard.\n\n\n\nUpon analyzing the audio data from the subjects, it has been determined that the altered voice belongs to a single person (SCP-1139-JP-A), and that \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 likely refers to SCP-1139-JP-A. Analysis of the voice suggests that SCP-1139-JP-A has the following traits:\n\n* Human of Asian descent\n\n* Female\n\n* Mid to late teens\n\n* Height of approximately 160cm\n\n* BMI of approximately 17\n\n* Certain degree of skill in singing\n\n\n\nIt has been reported that listening to the subjects elicits a mildly positive emotional response.\n\n\n\nThe first confirmed occurrence of SCP-1139-JP occurred on 2006/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588, on a video of singing uploaded to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (a video sharing site), Following this, sporadic occurrences of SCP-1139-JP continued. Initial containment consisted of deletion of the subjects and the use of the cover story \"pitch changes due to corruption of audio data\"; however, as the prevalence of SCP-1139-JP gradually increased, Project 1139-JP was created with the help of the Audio Research Team of the Foundation's Japanese branch, consisting of the development of a specialized vocal synthesis software and the use of a new cover story involving it.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#f0f8ff; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n\n= **Project 1139-JP**\n\n-----\n\n**Summary:** Project 1139-JP is composed of the following steps:\n\n# Development of a new version of existing vocal synthesis software.\n\n# Selection and voice recording of a person with voice similar to SCP-1139-A.\n\n# Apply effects to the voice data such that it resembles that of an SCP-1139-JP subject as closely as possible.\n\n# Release the created software (designated SCP-1139-JP-\u03b1) to the public.\n\n# Upon further occurrence of SCP-1139-JP, the cover story \"work using SCP-1139-JP-\u03b1\" can be used and any associated individuals can be amnesticized.\n\n\n\nIf changes in the properties of SCP-1139-JP occurrences are observed, Project 1139-JP is to be updated and amended accordingly.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-right\" style=\"width:300px;\"]]\n\n[[image http://scp-int.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-1139-jp/%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AA%E3%83%97%E3%83%88%E3%83%B3%E7%A4%BE.jpg style=\"width:300px;\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width:300px;\"]]\n\nThe building housing the offices of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a company involved in the creation of SCP-1139-JP-\u03b1.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nOver the course of one year, the Foundation worked with \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, companies developing related software to develop a new version of the software and select a voice actor with similar vocal qualities to that of SCP-1139-JP-A. This was considered an acceptable time frame for the creation of SCP-1139-JP-\u03b1.\n\n\n\nAlthough SCP-1139-JP-\u03b1 was unable to consistently produce ideal results, the rate of occurrence of SCP-1139-JP had been observed to be increasing slowly but quadratically. However, as it was determined that SCP-1139-JP-\u03b1 was able to produce ideal results when used correctly, SCP-1139-JP-\u03b1 was released in its imperfect state, with updated versions to be produced later.\n\n\n\nAfter adjustments were conducted through a front company, SCP-1139-JP-\u03b1 was released as a commercial product of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Following this, sales of SCP-1139-JP-\u03b1 far exceeded original expectations, and Project 1139-JP proceeded at an accelerated pace. Due to its unexpected popularity, the Foundation's Distribution Department is currently conducting research into possible related anomalies. It has been suggested that SCP-1139-JP's anomalous nature may be responsible for SCP-1139-JP-\u03b1's unprecedented increase in popularity; however, as SCP-1139-JP-\u03b1 and related work constitutes a major source of income for Foundation front companies, attempts to prevent continued work on SCP-1139-JP-\u03b1 are prohibited.\n\n\n\nDue to the nickname given by users to the SCP-1139-JP-\u03b1 image character \"\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\"[[footnote]]Name identical to that of SCP-1139-JP-A.[[/footnote]], henceforth referred to as SCP-1139-JP-\u03b1-1, Project 1139-JP was given the codename \"Utahime\"[[footnote]]**Translator's note:** Songstress, diva.[[/footnote]]. Due to the remarkable spread of SCP-1139-JP-\u03b1, Project \"Utahime\" has been determined to be satisfactorily completed. However, as the possibility of an information breach of SCP-1139-JP due to a decline in the use of SCP-1139-JP-\u03b1 cannot be ruled out, new versions of SCP-1139-JP-\u03b1 are continuously being developed.\n\n\n\nOn 20\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588, during investigation into the research facilities used by Tokiwa \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (PoI-831) to produce and distribute anomalous computer programs, several points of information thought to relate to SCP-1139-JP were discovered, including a diary belonging to an unknown individual. On the last page of the diary, an L-size photograph was discovered, depicting a young female (henceforth SCP-1139-JP-A-1) on an intravenous drip lying in what is thought to be a hospital bed; because of this, SCP-1139-JP-A-1 is thought to be the author of the diary. Based on an analysis of the skeletal structure of the person in the photo, there is a 78.2% chance that SCP-1139-JP-A-1 is the same person as SCP-1139-JP-A. In addition, based on the information in the diary, SCP-1139-JP-A-1 had used the name \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 in events prior to her passing.\n\n\n\nThe following attached document, Document 1139-JP-82439, consists of extracts from this diary.

To ensure its continued cooperation with Foundation personnel in the future, it is also lead to believe that the customs and moral concepts in Europe are still those of the 12th Century. Additionally, the entity is not to be coerced into raising and/or leaving SCP-125-DE-A. Should this occur regardless, it is to be lured into the area of effect of a Scranton Reality Anchor immediately to reestablish containment.</p>\n<p>Due to the immobility of SCP-125-DE and SCP-125-DE-A, Outpost-DE22/125 has been constructed in front of the entrance of SCP-125-DE-A. Outpost-DE22/125 is to always be staffed with at least 50 guards and to be equipped with gas and explosive weapons to defend against attacks on the site. Outpost-DE22/125 is to be contacted by other Foundation Sites using radio communication every 30 minutes and is to be asked for its status. Should no answer be received from Outpost-DE34/125, an MTF unit is to be send to check on the situation and- in worst case- prevent a potential takeover of the site by hostile forces.</p>\n<p>Efforts are to be undertaken to ensure a healthy population of common ravens (<em>Corvus corax</em>) at least in the area of the Burgberg. Should SCP-125-DE inquire on the presence of common ravens in Burgberg, their presence is to always be affirmed.</p>\n<p>For security reasons and to prevent the loss of valuable Foundation equipment, no Scranton Reality Anchors are allowed inside of SCP-125-DE-A.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-125-DE designates a humanoid entity, currently located in a large cavern beneath Burgberg in the Kyffh\u00e4user<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>. This cavern is part of a tunnel system, which, due to its nature, is designated as SCP-125-DE-A.</p>\n<p>SCP-125-DE has the appearance of a man between the ages of 60 and 70. The entity wears a red gown, a golden hoop crown adorned with different gems, and a crucifix; the entity measures 410\u00a0cm in height, but weight could not be determined- it is estimated to be around 800\u00a0kg. The entity sits on a throne that appears to be made of ivory and rests its head in its hands on a round marble table approximately 8 meters in diameter. The hair of the entity is continuously glowing with an orange-yellow light. SCP-125-DE has a beard that reaches through a hole in the table, down to the ground, and encircles the table approximately six and a half times. SCP-125-DE has yet to be observed taking in sustenance, and is therefore believed to not require any.</p>\n<p>Collected data suggests that SCP-125-DE is a Class IX reality bending entity. However, it only uses its powers to prevent itself from being harmed, relocated, or further contained in some form, particularly since the Foundation began monitoring; even while using its powers, SCP-125-DE only makes a minimal effort. Hostiles are teleported away a few meters and/or disarmed and persons tasked with moving SCP-125-DE suddenly forget their tasks. Given SCP-125-DE's impaired environmental perception, it is assumed that this is an automated defense mechanism on which the entity exerts no direct influence.</p>\n<p>SCP-125-DE seems to be half asleep at all times and reacts very slowly on its environment. It is still possible to hold conversations with it in every desired language, even if it takes very long for SCP-125-DE to formulate a response- most responses are often mumbled. SCP-125-DE claims to be Frederick I, the Holy Roman Emperor (nicknamed \"Barbarossa\") and states that it was imprisoned in SCP-125-DE-A<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup>. These claims could until now not conclusively verified or dismissed.</p>\n<p>The entity sometimes asks present personnel \"if there are still ravens on the mountain\". This question is always affirmed as of \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, causing SCP-125-DE to briefly sigh. At the moment, it is unknown if and how the presence of ravens in the area of Burgberg impacts SCP-125-DE, but the population of common ravens in the Kyffh\u00e4user and Burgberg in general was put under observation as a precaution.</p>\n<p>The interior of SCP-125-DE-A is currently not fully explored due to its size and possibly-limitless extents. The exploration is still being conducted. However, 567 life-size granite statues of knights, soldiers, and court servants have already been discovered in the caves, though their relocation for further study was not possible due to narrow spaces in SCP-125-DE-A<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup>. The cave system itself possess three anomalous properties; firstly, it is not possible to enter SCP-125-DE using other ways than its entrance. During attempts to burrow into the cave system from outside, the excavation crews only hit solid rock which fills out the entire space SCP-125-DE-A is supposed to occupy. Secondly, it is impossible to permanently damage SCP-125-DE-A, as any damage is repaired within seconds due to the passive effects of SCP-125-DE. Thirdly, any human entity inside of SCP-125-DE-A is shown to have intimate knowledge of the cave system from a practical standpoint, despite having never set foot in it. This third effect can be counteracted by actively focusing on reaching a different goal or area.</p>\n<p>SCP-125-DE-A appears to have been created by the abilities demonstrated by SCP-125-DE and seems to only exist as long as it is maintained by the entity. This circumstance complicates the containment of SCP-125-DE, because it cannot be exposed to Scranton reality anchors in its current state. If such a device is transported inside SCP-125-DE-A, it immediately erases the space influenced by reality bending in its area of effect and is subsequently removed from existence together with all matter in its area of effect. The lost space is replaced instantly after this sudden disappearance.</p>\n<p>Why SCP-125-DE claims to be imprisoned in a space created by itself is not known at this time. However, Dr. Stramm theorizes that the entity is only entrapped in SCP-125-DE-A because it believes itself to be imprisoned and activates its reality bending capabilities as a consequence.</p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Interview\u00a0125-DE-1</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Close</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Interviewing:</strong> Dr. Stramm</p>\n<p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> SCP-125-DE</p>\n<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Dr. Stramm had sat down besides SCP-125-DE and talked to it until it started responding.

Despite apparent lack of consistency between cases of the phenomenon's appearance, certain patterns have been deduced as intrinsic, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>SCP-1340 appears exclusively on cathode-ray tube-based devices (though implementation of this technology may vary) connected to analog television antennas;</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>SCP-1340's periods of activity fall between 23:00 and 02:00 on local time; all registered incidents involving SCP-1340 are localized to the northern hemisphere (between 45\u00b0 and 75\u00b0 latitude);</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Each particular registered incident has involved only a single witness (hereafter referred to as 'observer'). Possibility of concurrent observation in different locations has been confirmed by experiment; as such, the anomaly cannot be contained through observer isolation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>General analysis of anomaly witness reports as well as replicated contact efforts have permitted to pinpoint the course of SCP-1340's activity. During first contact the anomaly manifests on active television screens that have been showing \"white noise\" for extended periods of time. During subsequent contact events the anomaly is capable of overriding low-quality transmissions. Presence or absence of audio transmission has no effect on contact probability. Upon manifestation the device begins showing an image of a human eye which takes up the majority of the screen. Said eye is blue and belongs to a man; the image is clear and free of any effects that hamper overall perception of the contents.</p>\n<p>Analysis of the eye's sclera has confirmed that all instances of the anomaly transmit the image of the same man. The eye is always wide open (slowed and infrequent blinking is present), the pupil is dilated, and the eye often reacts (with delay) to the observer's movement, tracking them. If the affected device has audio enabled, upon manifestation the sound volume will be reduced to 25\u00a0dB, and it will consist of weak \"white noise\" static along with intact and fragmented words, distorted and pronounced with apparent difficulty.</p>\n<p>Should the observer shut off or destroy the device during first contact with SCP-1340 (destruction of the kinescope is sufficient in the latter case), the anomaly will no longer manifest in front of that observer. Otherwise the anomaly will continue manifesting itself on the device every time under the described requirements (even without the observer present). Under continued observation SCP-1340 expands its sphere of influence and begins to appear not only in the location of first contact, but also in other places where the observer is present.</p>\n<p>It has been noted that in 65% of registered cases during repeated contacts the anomaly brings into existence an unlimited number of CRT television devices of various kinds and models (exclusively within the locale of first contact), which seem to operate without any apparent power sources. The TVs are placed on the floor, on various furniture present and on each other, and vary in size substantially. During the anomaly's active periods all devices transmit the same image of SCP-1340, and the anomaly's eye is not able to track the observer (instead chaotically looking from side to side), while the sounds' volume (despite a considerable number of additional speakers) increases by only up to 10\u00a0dB.

The speed of processes running within a human brain is too high, far higher than our current speed of impulse recording, which means that we cannot adequately record and transmit the full thoughtform of a person without disrupting its connections and, as such, without degrading their consciousness and memory. Unfortunately, this lag does not allow us to experiment with copying a healthy person's personality; however, the Bureau members have found an alternative method.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p>It has been proposed that we use a comatose source in the experiment. I have taken responsibility and have found a suitable candidate for such a role.

We hereby request your assistance in arranging a classified experiment on transmitting their personality into the infosphere through our Bureau's newest antenna and receiving the resulting signal on the Chukot station. The process will take approximately two hours; chemical treatments developed by Bureau \u2116\u2588 are proposed to be used to slow the brain's activity as much as possible. Yes, we will be unable to halt the cerebral processes completely, but the estimated damage to the consciousness thoughtform is expected to be minimal.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p>Now onto the practical side of this research project. We expect the Chukchi Peninsula radio station personnel to receive the information of this person in format close to television standards. At this point we can only guess what it will look like, and whether such a transmission will bear any significance for further research. In overall, however, I foresee use of this technology applied to being able to transmit a speaker or presenter directly into every house, every particular receiver. The viewers will gain access to actual talk partners competent in various topics, who will be able to convey useful information more concretely to every particular listener. Just imagine: you turn on the TV, and the athletic show host does not only show you the exercises and keep count, but also points out mistakes and gives professional advice. Educational shows for children and adults, news reports, sport shows, travel and history documentaries etc. will grow to a new level, open the path to fully-fledged connection and feedback.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p>I would like to specifically address any possible concerns about the experiment's ethical side. The operations involved will cause no physical consequences or even discomfort to the test subject. All records of this intervention will be kept secret. I would also like to point out the fact that the resulting information model of a human (\"phantom\", thoughtform, or \"mind mold\") is not human in the word's common meaning, and exists only as an idea, a information current, which puts it closer to a soulless computer.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p><strong>Bureau \u21164 Director</strong><br/>\n<strong>\u00abMind and consciousness\u00bb</strong><br/>\n<strong>Krivopalov A.C.</strong></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">-\u00a0Close</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><br/></p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">+\u00a0Transcription\u00a0of\u00a0SCP-1340's\u00a0speech\u00a0pattern\u00a0analysis</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">-\u00a0Close</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>The following transcript has been procured through the Foundation's speech recognition hardware from registered occurrences of the anomaly.

Anomaly witness identification and capture is to be performed according to standard Foundation search protocols. All circumstances of contact with the anomaly are to be ascertained on successful capture. If the first contact with SCP-1340 has been broken prematurely, it is required to perform a second test contact attempt. If the test proves negative, the subject is to be administered class B amnestics and released (with a week-long period of observation). All other subjects are to undergo comprehensive treatment procedures [[footnote]] including shock therapy, use of psychotropic substances and neuroprogramming video recordings[[/footnote]] and be administered class D amnestics. Should treatment fail, false memories of their personality and a dislike to television technologies should be implanted as per the \"Second Life\" protocol. Such subjects are then to be relocated to closed communes under Foundation control [[footnote]] No restrictions on sharing living space with victims of interaction with other anomalies are necessary (under authorization by community curator). [[/footnote]] (in particular, those lacking access to television), where they can be used in covert safe research experiments amidst routine tasks.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-1340 is a phenomenon consisting of spontaneous appearances of an image of a human eye on CRT-based TV screens; said image takes up the majority of the kinescope's visible area. Despite apparent lack of consistency between cases of the phenomenon's appearance, certain patterns have been deduced as intrinsic, such as:\n\n\n\n* SCP-1340 appears exclusively on cathode-ray tube-based devices (though implementation of this technology may vary) connected to analog television antennas;\n\n\n\n* SCP-1340's periods of activity fall between 23:00 and 02:00 on local time; all registered incidents involving SCP-1340 are localized to the northern hemisphere (between 45\u00b0 and 75\u00b0 latitude);\n\n\n\n* Each particular registered incident has involved only a single witness (hereafter referred to as 'observer'). Possibility of concurrent observation in different locations has been confirmed by experiment; as such, the anomaly cannot be contained through observer isolation.\n\n\n\nGeneral analysis of anomaly witness reports as well as replicated contact efforts have permitted to pinpoint the course of SCP-1340's activity. During first contact the anomaly manifests on active television screens that have been showing \"white noise\" for extended periods of time. During subsequent contact events the anomaly is capable of overriding low-quality transmissions. Presence or absence of audio transmission has no effect on contact probability. Upon manifestation the device begins showing an image of a human eye which takes up the majority of the screen. Said eye is blue and belongs to a man; the image is clear and free of any effects that hamper overall perception of the contents.\n\n\n\nAnalysis of the eye's sclera has confirmed that all instances of the anomaly transmit the image of the same man. The eye is always wide open (slowed and infrequent blinking is present), the pupil is dilated, and the eye often reacts (with delay) to the observer's movement, tracking them. If the affected device has audio enabled, upon manifestation the sound volume will be reduced to 25 dB, and it will consist of weak \"white noise\" static along with intact and fragmented words, distorted and pronounced with apparent difficulty.\n\n\n\nShould the observer shut off or destroy the device during first contact with SCP-1340 (destruction of the kinescope is sufficient in the latter case), the anomaly will no longer manifest in front of that observer. Otherwise the anomaly will continue manifesting itself on the device every time under the described requirements (even without the observer present). Under continued observation SCP-1340 expands its sphere of influence and begins to appear not only in the location of first contact, but also in other places where the observer is present.\n\n\n\nIt has been noted that in 65% of registered cases during repeated contacts the anomaly brings into existence an unlimited number of CRT television devices of various kinds and models (exclusively within the locale of first contact), which seem to operate without any apparent power sources. The TVs are placed on the floor, on various furniture present and on each other, and vary in size substantially. During the anomaly's active periods all devices transmit the same image of SCP-1340, and the anomaly's eye is not able to track the observer (instead chaotically looking from side to side), while the sounds' volume (despite a considerable number of additional speakers) increases by only up to 10 dB. The TV devices are off while the anomaly is inactive.\n\n\n\nObservers rarely disclose the occasion and usually consider it a sign of psychological illness. In rare cases the subjects have been able to get rid of SCP-1340's presence through prolonged medical treatment; in addition, the observers develop phobias towards watching television, which prevent further contacts with the anomaly. Due to the circumstances above the Foundation is currently unable to discern the periodicity of manifestations or the overall ammount of contact cases.\n\n\n\nAll experiments with SCP-1340 have been classified by the Ethics Committee.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Foundation has successfully recovered several documents that explain the anomaly's appearance from internal GoI archive records; the addendums are available with clearance level 4.\n\n\n\n**Addendums to the SCP-1340 document:**\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Suicide letter belonging to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588. \u2588. 11.01.1969\" hide=\"- Close\" hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n\n\n\n**Suicide letter belonging to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588. \u2588. 11.01.1969**\n\n\n\n\n\n> My name is \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, I am an accountant at \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and this will be my suicide note.

Unfortunately, this lag does not allow us to experiment with copying a healthy person's personality; however, the Bureau members have found an alternative method.\n\n[[/<]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[<]]\n\nIt has been proposed that we use a comatose source in the experiment. I have taken responsibility and have found a suitable candidate for such a role. Under medical attention in municipal hospital \u2116\u2588\u2588 currently lies patient \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588. \u2588., in a state of coma after a tragic accident. We hereby request your assistance in arranging a classified experiment on transmitting their personality into the infosphere through our Bureau's newest antenna and receiving the resulting signal on the Chukot station. The process will take approximately two hours; chemical treatments developed by Bureau \u2116\u2588 are proposed to be used to slow the brain's activity as much as possible. Yes, we will be unable to halt the cerebral processes completely, but the estimated damage to the consciousness thoughtform is expected to be minimal.\n\n[[/<]]\n\n\n\n[[<]]\n\nNow onto the practical side of this research project. We expect the Chukchi Peninsula radio station personnel to receive the information of this person in format close to television standards. At this point we can only guess what it will look like, and whether such a transmission will bear any significance for further research. In overall, however, I foresee use of this technology applied to being able to transmit a speaker or presenter directly into every house, every particular receiver. The viewers will gain access to actual talk partners competent in various topics, who will be able to convey useful information more concretely to every particular listener. Just imagine: you turn on the TV, and the athletic show host does not only show you the exercises and keep count, but also points out mistakes and gives professional advice. Educational shows for children and adults, news reports, sport shows, travel and history documentaries etc. will grow to a new level, open the path to fully-fledged connection and feedback.\n\n[[/<]]\n\n\n\n[[<]]\n\nI would like to specifically address any possible concerns about the experiment's ethical side. The operations involved will cause no physical consequences or even discomfort to the test subject. All records of this intervention will be kept secret. I would also like to point out the fact that the resulting information model of a human (\"phantom\", thoughtform, or \"mind mold\") is not human in the word's common meaning, and exists only as an idea, a information current, which puts it closer to a soulless computer.\n\n[[/<]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n**Bureau \u21164 Director**\n\n**\u00abMind and consciousness\u00bb**\n\n**Krivopalov A.C.**\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0_\n\n\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Transcription of SCP-1340's speech pattern analysis\" hide=\"- Close\" hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following transcript has been procured through the Foundation's speech recognition hardware from registered occurrences of the anomaly.

SCP-148-DE often appears as a steadily moving sphere with an average diameter of two metres. The object is surrounded by a transparent membrane that holds together the fluid inside. SCP-148-DE's membrane exhibits exceptional plastic deformability, which allows it to deform almost without restriction. The membrane is selectively permeable, which allows certain objects to penetrate SCP-148-DE. For this reason, the surface is perceived as slightly sticky and pleasantly warm. SCP-148-DE is able to regulate its body temperature, even though it is strongly influenced by the room temperature. Where it gets its energy from is under investigation. So far, it has not been required to consume any form of food, apart from negligible amounts of liquid.</p>\n<p>SCP-148-DE is capable of reaching a velocity of 10\u00a0m/s, although it never normally exceeds 1.2\u00a0m/s. Examination of tissue samples revealed that SCP-148-DE consists mainly of water and animal proteins. SCP-148-DE has a pH of 5.5 at last examination.</p>\n<p>SCP-148-DE did not respond to auditory and visual stimuli at the beginning of its containment, but this changed during its time in the custody of the SCP Foundation. SCP-148-DE appears to be intelligent, perhaps even possessing the intelligence of a human being. The object uses outgrowths to pick up objects or touch personnel. It reshapes these each time, only to reabsorb them into the base mass later. The object has so far shown great interest in Foundation personnel and interacted intensively with the maintenance staff and researchers present. Researchers and agents stated that SCP-148-DE is very cautious and gently scans their bodies. It removed possessions several times and apparently studied them, before returning them. SCP-148-DE appears to make active attacks difficult by dodging and deforming. When attempting to take samples, the object formed club-like outgrowths and fought back with them. Dr. Sturm suspected it mistook the researchers for predators in this case.</p>\n<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-148-DE was found by a group of senior citizens in an abandoned house. It was subsequently brought to site-DE16-EX to initiate investigations. After the discovery of <a href=\"http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-042-de\" target=\"_blank\">SCP-042-DE</a>, SCP-148-DE was relocated.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-148-DE continues to evolve through interactions. Thus, the object increasingly began to change its shape to have semi-human features. On 10 June 2003, it was able to form itself completely into a copy of the present <a href=\"http://scp-int.wikidot.com/personalakte-von-dr-faust\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. S. Faust</a>, <a href=\"http://scp-int.wikidot.com/personalakte-von-agent-peterson\" target=\"_blank\">Agent A. Peterson</a>, Dr. M. von Reichstein and Dr. A. von Reichstein. In doing so, it did not alter its colouring. Since then, this behaviour has not changed and SCP-148-DE actively began to imitate the actions. For better communication, the object was therefore taught to write. It was noticeable that SCP-148-DE learned this quickly and partly began to develop new creations for missing terms.</p>\n<div class=\"colmod-block\">\n<ul>\n<li class=\"folded colmod-collapsiblealt\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style: none\">_</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"colmod-link-top\">\n<div class=\"foldable-list-container\"><a href=\"javascript:;\">\u21e5 Communication with SCP-148-DE \u21e4</a><a href=\"javascript:;\">\u21c3 Communication with SCP-148-DE \u21c2</a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"colmod-content\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Foreword: This is SCP-148-DE's first interview.

Inside the chamber is a white board with water-soluble markers. On the north side is a mirror.\n\n\n\nStaff should treat the object like a human being, keeping in mind that their behaviour shapes the object. For this reason, access is restricted by a psychological evaluation and training by Senior Research Staff (primarily Dr. Richter). Access to the containment chamber of the object is only allowed with permission from the Site Director until SCP-148-DE's effect on objects and especially humans is understood.\n\n\n\nIn the event that SCP-148-DE escapes its containment chamber, the MTF DE28-\ud835\udd7e shall lure the object into a \u210d\ud835\udd3c\ud835\udd43-transport containment that is at least a CBE-2 Zajin class. Personnel should be careful not to use unnecessarily violent methods to lure SCP-148-DE into the transport containment so as not to cause irritation.

SCP-148-DE often appears as a steadily moving sphere with an average diameter of two metres. The object is surrounded by a transparent membrane that holds together the fluid inside. SCP-148-DE's membrane exhibits exceptional plastic deformability, which allows it to deform almost without restriction. The membrane is selectively permeable, which allows certain objects to penetrate SCP-148-DE. For this reason, the surface is perceived as slightly sticky and pleasantly warm. SCP-148-DE is able to regulate its body temperature, even though it is strongly influenced by the room temperature. Where it gets its energy from is under investigation. So far, it has not been required to consume any form of food, apart from negligible amounts of liquid. \n\n\n\nSCP-148-DE is capable of reaching a velocity of 10 m/s, although it never normally exceeds 1.2 m/s.\u00a0\u00a0Examination of tissue samples revealed that SCP-148-DE consists mainly of water and animal proteins. SCP-148-DE has a pH of 5.5 at last examination. \n\n\n\nSCP-148-DE did not respond to auditory and visual stimuli at the beginning of its containment, but this changed during its time in the custody of the SCP Foundation. SCP-148-DE appears to be intelligent, perhaps even possessing the intelligence of a human being. The object uses outgrowths to pick up objects or touch personnel. It reshapes these each time, only to reabsorb them into the base mass later. The object has so far shown great interest in Foundation personnel and interacted intensively with the maintenance staff and researchers present. Researchers and agents stated that SCP-148-DE is very cautious and gently scans their bodies. It removed possessions several times and apparently studied them, before returning them. SCP-148-DE appears to make active attacks difficult by dodging and deforming. When attempting to take samples, the object formed club-like outgrowths and fought back with them. Dr. Sturm suspected it mistook the researchers for predators in this case.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-148-DE was found by a group of senior citizens in an abandoned house. It was subsequently brought to site-DE16-EX to initiate investigations. After the discovery of [*http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-042-de SCP-042-DE], SCP-148-DE was relocated.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Addendum:** SCP-148-DE continues to evolve through interactions. Thus, the object increasingly began to change its shape to have semi-human features. On 10 June 2003, it was able to form itself completely into a copy of the present [*http://scp-int.wikidot.com/personalakte-von-dr-faust Dr. S. Faust], [*http://scp-int.wikidot.com/personalakte-von-agent-peterson Agent A. Peterson], Dr. M. von Reichstein and Dr. A. von Reichstein. In doing so, it did not alter its colouring. Since then, this behaviour has not changed and SCP-148-DE actively began to imitate the actions. For better communication, the object was therefore taught to write. It was noticeable that SCP-148-DE learned this quickly and partly began to develop new creations for missing terms.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:coltop\">component:coltop</a> show=\u21e5 Communication with SCP-148-DE \u21e4|hide=\u21c3 Communication with SCP-148-DE \u21c2|folded=true|ifprot=true]]\n\n> //Foreword: This is SCP-148-DE's first interview.

Should entry be necessary, a small storage marquee is to be erected on the ground above SCP-149-DE where the opening will be made under the guise of pedologic studies. This measure serves the avoidance of eyewitnesses. Complete public exclusion is impossible due to SCP-149-DE\u2019s location.</p>\n<p>Personnel are to enter SCP-149-DE unarmed and without ballistic protection equipment. Radio contact is required to be maintained at all times. When subjects are within SCP-149-DE, at least 10 fully armed guards are to be positioned at the exit. Should radio contact be lost or when it becomes otherwise evident that the personnel in SCP-149-DE were compromised by SCP-149-DE-A, all guards must keep their weapons ready to terminate all individuals emerging from the structure. All personnel that entered SCP-149-DE are to be subjected to a thorough psychological evaluation.

The opening in SCP-149-DE is to be fully closed and concealed following the completion of all tasks.</p>\n<p>Currently, SCP-149-DE-A is safely contained inside SCP-149-DE and does not require further containment efforts. If an expedition into SCP-149-DE becomes necessary, SCP-149-DE-A is not to be touched under any circumstance. Means of evading SCP-149-DE-A\u2019s attention remain unknown. Once SCP-149-DE has been entered, it is advised to move as fast as possible. Should SCP-149-DE-A be sighted, the expedition force must return to the missions starting point, regardless of SCP-149-DE-A being in pursuit. Remote surveillance via drones, cameras, and microphones is not advised.</p>\n<p>A disinformation campaigns has to maintain the belief that SCP-149-DE was filled completely and can no longer be entered. Surveillance of SCP-149-DE is carried out via locally rented apartments. Should unauthorized parties try to gain access to SCP-149-DE, they are to be detained and interrogated. In case of an attack, the surrounding Foundation sites are to be informed and available troops are to be deployed.</p>\n<p>Public or private efforts to build upon SCP-149-DE are to be destroyed or prevented by all means.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-149-DE designates the remains of the F\u00fchrerbunker in Berlin. Against openly available facts SCP-149-DE is still accessible and in better shape, even though all its entrances have been sealed.</p>\n<p>SCP-149-DE possesses three anomalous properties. The concrete SCP-149-DE was built from is notably harder and more solid than any other known kind of concrete. This concrete has shown no signs of aging or erosion since Foundation acquisition, presumably because of its second property to repair any damage done to it within seconds. The third property of SCP-149-DE is its apparent ability to prevent SCP-149-DE-A from leaving the structure.</p>\n<p>SCP-149-DE-A is a class II<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>incorporeal humanoid entity which is seemingly trapped within SCP-149-DE. It possesses a horned head similar to a cow skull, a short tail, and a transparent black muscular body. It continuously drips a tar-like substance. This substance vanishes upon contact with matter, which has rendered collection unfeasible. The size of SCP-149-DE-A has never been accurately determined but is estimated to be 190\u00a0cm. Due to the topography of SCP-149-DE and the aggressive demeanor of SCP-149-DE-A, very little data is available.</p>\n<p>During previous expeditions into SCP-149-DE, SCP-149-DE-A was observed to either walk through the corridors of the bunker or sit on a chair, although this behavior was only noted during the first expedition. On all other missions, SCP-149-DE was encountered seemingly searching for the expedition troops, supporting the theory that SCP-149-DE-A is able to detect humans within SCP-149-DE. Attempts to surveil SCP-149-DE-A with drones and cameras failed because it immediately seeks out such devices when no humans are present in SCP-149-DE. How the entity affects electronics is unknown but cameras affected by it only show heavily distorted footage with occasional insertions of national socialist symbols. After becoming affected by SCP-149-DE, microphones only record continuous screaming, stemming from several persons. Software used for voice analysis found a match for individual voices with those of Joseph Goebbels, Hans Krebs and Adolf Hitler. <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">What relation those persons have to SCP-149-DE-A is unknown at this time.</span></p>\n<p>SCP-149-DE behaves in a hostile manner towards living humans and attacks every subject that enters its field of vision. SCP-149-DE-A passes through all materials without resistance except walls, ceilings, floors and doors of SCP-149-DE and is therefore unable to cause physical damage. Should it touch a subject, it will stiffen while its personality is radically restructured. Those afflicted gain a worldview strongly impacted by racism, antisemitism, anti-communism, and social Darwinism as well as a great hatred against the victorious powers of the Second World War and become extremely willing to resort to violence. Subjects are from this point on driven to create and propagate a national socialist fundamental order on a global scale. To this end, they use every available means. Since intelligence and memories of the afflicted remain unchanged, sometimes a thorough psychological evaluation is required because subjects often pretend to have not been affected by SCP-149-DE-A\u2019s properties.</p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Interview\u00a0with\u00a0a\u00a0SCP-149-DE-A\u00a0subject</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Close</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Agent Reiter has been a member of MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e \u201ePSI-Corps\u201d<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> and had been attacked by SCP-149-DE-A on the first expedition into SCP-149-DE.

To many screwed up genes in this world, they are the root of all evils that ail humanity.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Stier:</strong> What do you think to do against it? Can something be done against it?</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Reiter:</strong> Yes, of course you can do something against it. Sort out those with inferior genes and eradicate them with root and branch.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Stier:</strong> How would you determine who the ones possessing good genes are?</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Reiter:</strong> As a first step I would use the genealogy. Much bad blood can be traced back to certain races. Afterward, modern methods can be used to create humans with superior genetics.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Stier</strong> Races? Which one would be the one that you would choose?</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Reiter:</strong> That would be the Aryans. They are vastly superior to other races.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Stier:</strong> And all other races should be eradicated?</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Reiter:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Stier:</strong> Agent Reiter, you are aware that your husband is from Hungary, right? He is a Slav. You married him two years ago.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Reiter:</strong> Yes, greatest failure of my life but I didn\u2019t know any better back then. Thank god we didn\u2019t have children. I will get to the divorce immediately once I am out of here.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Stier:</strong> You spoke about the world being intervened by bad genes.

They had the right idea!</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Stier:</strong> I know what you are getting at and I oppose it with all my being. But tell me one thing. Why did you tell me all this so freely?

I think we are done here for now.</p>\n<p><em>Ende des Logs.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Closing Remarks:</strong> Agent Reiter was classified as Class E personnel and was placed under surveillance. The subject still attempts to propagate her ideology to anyone who listens to her. Others affected by SCP-149-DE showed less openness and are often secretive. Although unknown, it is regarded as probable that constitutes the result of a learning process of SCP-149-DE-A. Resulting assumptions about SCP-149-DE-A possessing a telepathic to its victims are regarded as <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">un</span>confirmed \u2014at this time (See Incident 149-DE-1).

Should entry be necessary, a small storage marquee is to be erected on the ground above SCP-149-DE where the opening will be made under the guise of pedologic studies. This measure serves the avoidance of eyewitnesses. Complete public exclusion is impossible due to SCP-149-DE\u2019s location. \n\n\n\nPersonnel are to enter SCP-149-DE unarmed and without ballistic protection equipment. Radio contact is required to be maintained at all times. When subjects are within SCP-149-DE, at least 10 fully armed guards are to be positioned at the exit. Should radio contact be lost or when it becomes otherwise evident that the personnel in SCP-149-DE were compromised by SCP-149-DE-A, all guards must keep their weapons ready to terminate all individuals emerging from the structure. All personnel that entered SCP-149-DE are to be subjected to a thorough psychological evaluation. Should corruption by SCP-149-DE be detected, the affected individuals are to be classified as class E personnel and to be quarantined until further notice. The opening in SCP-149-DE is to be fully closed and concealed following the completion of all tasks. \n\n\n\nCurrently, SCP-149-DE-A is safely contained inside SCP-149-DE and does not require further containment efforts. If an expedition into SCP-149-DE becomes necessary, SCP-149-DE-A is not to be touched under any circumstance. Means of evading SCP-149-DE-A\u2019s attention remain unknown. Once SCP-149-DE has been entered, it is advised to move as fast as possible. Should SCP-149-DE-A be sighted, the expedition force must return to the missions starting point, regardless of SCP-149-DE-A being in pursuit. Remote surveillance via drones, cameras, and microphones is not advised. \n\n\n\nA disinformation campaigns has to maintain the belief that SCP-149-DE was filled completely and can no longer be entered. Surveillance of SCP-149-DE is carried out via locally rented apartments. Should unauthorized parties try to gain access to SCP-149-DE, they are to be detained and interrogated. In case of an attack, the surrounding Foundation sites are to be informed and available troops are to be deployed.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nPublic or private efforts to build upon SCP-149-DE are to be destroyed or prevented by all means. \n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-149-DE designates the remains of the F\u00fchrerbunker in Berlin. Against openly available facts SCP-149-DE is still accessible and in better shape, even though all its entrances have been sealed. \n\n\n\nSCP-149-DE possesses three anomalous properties. The concrete SCP-149-DE was built from is notably harder and more solid than any other known kind of concrete. This concrete has shown no signs of aging or erosion since Foundation acquisition, presumably because of its second property to repair any damage done to it within seconds. The third property of SCP-149-DE is its apparent ability to prevent SCP-149-DE-A from leaving the structure. \n\n\n\nSCP-149-DE-A is a class II[[footnote]] An entity with a visible appearance that is unable to interact with matter in any way. [[/footnote]]incorporeal humanoid entity which is seemingly trapped within SCP-149-DE. It possesses a horned head similar to a cow skull, a short tail, and a transparent black muscular body. It continuously drips a tar-like substance. This substance vanishes upon contact with matter,\u00a0\u00a0which has rendered collection unfeasible. The size of SCP-149-DE-A has never been accurately determined but is estimated to be 190 cm. Due to the topography of SCP-149-DE and the aggressive demeanor of SCP-149-DE-A, very little data is available.\n\n\n\nDuring previous expeditions into SCP-149-DE, SCP-149-DE-A was observed to either walk through the corridors of the bunker or sit on a chair, although this behavior was only noted during the first expedition. On all other missions, SCP-149-DE was encountered seemingly searching for the expedition troops, supporting the theory that SCP-149-DE-A is able to detect humans within SCP-149-DE. Attempts to surveil SCP-149-DE-A with drones and cameras failed because it immediately seeks out such devices when no humans are present in SCP-149-DE. How the entity affects electronics is unknown but cameras affected by it only show heavily distorted footage with occasional insertions of national socialist symbols. After becoming affected by SCP-149-DE, microphones only record continuous screaming, stemming from several persons. Software used for voice analysis found a match for individual voices with those of Joseph Goebbels, Hans Krebs and Adolf Hitler. --What relation those persons have to SCP-149-DE-A is unknown at this time.--\n\n\n\nSCP-149-DE behaves in a hostile manner towards living humans and attacks every subject that enters its field of vision. SCP-149-DE-A passes through all materials without resistance except walls, ceilings, floors and doors of SCP-149-DE and is therefore unable to cause physical damage. Should it touch a subject, it will stiffen while its personality is radically restructured. Those afflicted gain a worldview strongly impacted by racism, antisemitism, anti-communism, and social Darwinism as well as a great hatred against the victorious powers of the Second World War and become extremely willing to resort to violence. Subjects are from this point on driven to create and propagate a national socialist fundamental order on a global scale. To this end, they use every available means. Since intelligence and memories of the afflicted remain unchanged, sometimes a thorough psychological evaluation is required because subjects often pretend to have not been affected by SCP-149-DE-A\u2019s properties.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Interview with a SCP-149-DE-A subject\" hide=\"Close\"]]\n\n\n\n> **Foreword:** Agent Reiter has been a member of MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e \u201ePSI-Corps\u201d[[footnote]] Translators Note: MTF DE4-\ud835\udd0e \u201ePSI-Corps\u201d a German MTF tasked with the capture and containment of mind-affecting anomalies and memes.

Can something be done against it?\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Reiter:** Yes, of course you can do something against it. Sort out those with inferior genes and eradicate them with root and branch. \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Stier:** How would you determine who the ones possessing good genes are? \n\n> \n\n> **Agent Reiter:** As a first step I would use the genealogy. Much bad blood can be traced back to certain races. Afterward, modern methods can be used to create humans with superior genetics.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Stier** Races? Which one would be the one that you would choose? \n\n> \n\n> **Agent Reiter:** That would be the Aryans. They are vastly superior to other races.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Stier:** And all other races should be eradicated?\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Reiter:** Yeah.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Stier:** Agent Reiter, you are aware that your husband is from Hungary, right? He is a Slav. You married him two years ago. \n\n> \n\n> **Agent Reiter:** Yes, greatest failure of my life but I didn\u2019t know any better back then. Thank god we didn\u2019t have children. I will get to the divorce immediately once I am out of here. \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Stier:** You spoke about the world being intervened by bad genes. Do you wish to enforce your agenda everywhere? \n\n> \n\n> **Agent Reiter:** Of course, otherwise, this bane would return over and over again. \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Stier:** You know that the world would not be willing to let that happen.\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Reiter:** Then we have to convince it. And who we cannot convince, we have to force. \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Stier:** Would you go so far as to start a war. Like, a really big one. \n\n> \n\n> **Agent Reiter:** Yes, as big as he has to be.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Stier:** You are aware that this is the ideology of the Nazis. \n\n> \n\n> **Agent Reiter:** Yes. I can see that you aren\u2019t thrilled but is it my fault that those assholes called Allies vilified the Nazis? They had the right idea! \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Stier:** I know what you are getting at and I oppose it with all my being. But tell me one thing. Why did you tell me all this so freely? Had you kept silent you could have waited until more people got attacked SCP-149-DE-A to gain more allies. \n\n> \n\n> **Agent Reiter:** ...\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Stier:** Mrs Reiter?\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Reiter:** I think you are right but... It just wants out, you know? If I can\u2019t convince you then I want you at least to listen to me. I don\u2019t know why\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Stier:** Hm. I think we are done here for now.\n\n> \n\n> //Ende des Logs.// \n\n> \n\n> **Closing Remarks:** Agent Reiter was classified as Class E personnel and was placed under surveillance. The subject still attempts to propagate her ideology to anyone who listens to her. Others affected by SCP-149-DE showed less openness and are often secretive. Although unknown, it is regarded as probable that constitutes the result of a learning process of SCP-149-DE-A. Resulting assumptions about SCP-149-DE-A possessing a telepathic to its victims are regarded as --un--confirmed --at this time (See Incident 149-DE-1).

Photography equipment that shot SCP-149-KO should be stored separately from regular equipment.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-149-KO is an artefact made of steel wire sized, 21cm x 21cm x 39cm, that was found in the basement of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Gallery of Art. A semi-transparent white text that reads 'Are We Cool Yet?' appears in the centre of footage and images of SCP-149-KO. Photography produced by analogue film cameras also displays the same phenomenon.</p>\n<p>When photographed over 100 times or filmed for over thirty minutes with the same equipment, the text will display on all images and footage produced by the equipment. This phenomenon can be stopped by changing the equipment's lens. However, the affected lens cannot be physically distinguished from normal lenses. When the affected lens is attached to unaffected equipment, they also display the same anomaly.</p>\n<p>If a human sees SCP-149-KO for over thirty minutes, the same watermark appears in the centre of the person's vision, even if their eyes are closed, causing chronic optical fatigue. The watermark does not automatically fade away, though it is confirmed that replacing the victim's cornea can remove the text.</p>\n<p>The watermark was visible on the warehouse CCTV footage of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Gallery of Art where SCP-149-KO was discovered. Three janitors of the gallery expressed optical fatigue caused by SCP-149-KO.

Should the user expire before the completion of the instance or if they are no longer available for other reasons, then either a fitting replacement is to be procured as fast as within the bounds of the protocol possible or the SCP-150-DE instance to be stored in at least three (3) different locations to impede theft until a new fitting user has been found.</p>\n<p>Users of SCP-150-DE are to be chosen from trained MTF of security personnel exclusively. Significant traits for this qualification include character, psychological profile, experience, bodily fitness, physique and loyalty towards the Foundation.

Acceptable methods in this regard are psychological therapy with subsequent employment as security personnel of the respective site, incarceration or, in emergencies, termination.</p>\n<p>Should an SCP-150-DE user expire, their remains are to be properly interred and the materials of his SCP-150-DE instance to be returned to the production cycle after thorough study.</p>\n<p>If they are not being studied, instances of SCP-150-DE-\u0391<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> and SCP-150-DE-\u03a9 are to be disassembled and locked within medium value containment lockers.</p>\n<p>If any instances of SCP-150-DE-\u0391 or SCP-150-DE-\u03a9 are encountered outside of the Foundation, they are to be confiscated or, upon retaliation, to be neutralized using heavy kinetic energy penetrators or other suitable weapons. The information in this paragraph is to be relayed to all agents involved in combat missions, regardless of the classification of this document.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-150-DE describes a series of Tactical Power Armors with anomalous properties. All currently stored or used models encase their wearer completely and make them capable of greater performance than that possible for a normal human. Some technologies used were until now not completely understood by the Foundation, although a great part of them is reproducible.</p>\n<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> Since 1995, the Foundation conducts research to create a functional exoskeleton for combat missions, medical treatment, and logistics. The first non-anomalous models were finished in the year 2000, but there were several problems regarding their carrying capacity and their energy supply, rendering them unsuited for practical applications.</p>\n<p>In 2001, the Foundation took notice of the technology of Raptor Tec. Industries and showed great interest in their Tactical Combat Armors. They not only were capable of enhancing the performance capability of their users and to suppress their emotions, but also possessed haptic sensors on all surfaces and could be equipped with different weapon systems, such as grenade launchers, cannons, or lasers. Additionally, they provided reliable protection against several environmental influences and could be linked with the neural system of their wearer, allowing support of all actions undertaken by an inbuilt AI. At this time, the Foundation didn't know that Raptor Tec. Industries worked with anomalies and was obligated by contract to not research their products. For this reason, the power armor did not recieve an SCP classification and wasn\u2019t studied. They were successfully deployed several times in controlled environments but were only used once in the field.</p>\n<p>During Incident <a href=\"http://scp-int.wikidot.com/028-de-i2\">#028-DE/I2</a>, the Foundation took possession of several Tactical Power Armors of the <a href=\"http://scp-int.wikidot.com/skp-portal\">SKP</a>, residing in a parallel universe. At the same time, when their obvious anomalous properties came to light, it was also noted that R.T.I.-Armors possessed capabilities unexplainable by the Foundation, as for example the temporary prevention of the death of a fatally wounded user and the forced take over of his body by the integrated AI. Raptor Tec. Industries were subsequently ordered to surrender to the Foundation and to hand over their anomalous technologies. Following this, the company went into hiding and from then on kept acting from the underground. Its armors were classified as SCP-150-DE-A, while the captured models of the SKP gained the designation SCP-150-DE-\u03a9.</p>\n<p>The replication of these technologies proved difficult in the beginning until computer technicians from Site-DE03 managed to download big parts of the SKP database from R-3379-DE. While the Foundation is still not capable of understanding the basic principles of most technologies, it managed to replicate them after initial difficulties.</p>\n<p>While technologies like the required servomotors and general construction could be replicated one-to-one, problems arose in creating the required materials, amongst other things. R.T.I. and the SKP used materials with structures, which could either not be produced at all, only with great effort or only with high material costs. Foundation engineers were capable of substituting these materials with normal ones in most cases, but this resulted in lowered performance and resilience. For the bigger part, they could help themselves on this matter with data collected from files of Section XXV by Research Team 25, also in cases were the usage of normal materials wasn\u2019t feasible. Section XXV too had searched for stronger, lighter and especially easy to produce materials to counteract the constant shortage of resources in the GDR, basing themselves on documents of the SKP formerly residing in this universe, amongst others.</p>\n<p>Another problem was posed by the supply with energy. R.T.I. used a currently for replication insufficiently analyzed accumulator, while the SKP relied on a motor, whose reverse engineered Foundation prototypes don\u2019t operate stably at this time. This obstacle could be overcome with the aid of <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/scp-156-de\">SCP-156-DE</a>, which delivered information on the construction and cost-effective production of glass batteries.</p>\n<p>Since the neuronal connection of SCP-150-DE-\u0391 or SCP-150-DE-\u03a9 could not be replicated until recently, pressure sensors on the armors inside were initially used to move the armor with the wearer. However, that resulted in unwanted oscillations.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Test Log 150-DE/087</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> In this test, the third try was undertaken to get SCP-150-DE components to mimic their wearer's movements. The test subject is a D-Class employee, whose right arm is inserted up to the shoulder in an SCP-150-DE prototype (It is a glove with the corresponding arm) fixed to a frame to not burden the test subject with the weight. The test is being conducted by Dr. Kulzer in a standard testing chamber in Site-DE12. Medical personnel is available on call.</p>\n<p>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>D-93749:</strong> A robo-arm, how awesome!</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Kulzer:</strong> Actually, it's a glove.</p>\n<p><strong>D-93749:</strong> Will this later become an actual suit? That would be epic.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Kulzer:</strong> No comment. Nine-three, I'll start the energy input now.</p>\n<p><em>Dr. Kulzer flips the main switch on his control panel. The prototype starts to hum quietly.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Kulzer:</strong> Everything alright so far?</p>\n<p><strong>D-93749:</strong> Yeah. Everything's okay. What do I do now?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Kulzer:</strong> For now, normal movements. Please move the arm slowly upwards.</p>\n<p><strong>D-93749:</strong> Gotcha.</p>\n<p><em>D-93749 stretches his arm upwards. During this process, the prototype accelerates constantly.</em></p>\n<p><strong>D-93749:</strong> Hoho, this is great- WOAH!</p>\n<p><em>D-93749's arm stretches a little bit over the zenith and behind the subject, before suddenly moving into the other direction and comes to a stop oriented upwards in a relatively straight position.</em></p>\n<p><strong>D-93749:</strong> Doc? I think you still have to tweak this a little bit. I pushed constantly upwards the entire time.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Kulzer:</strong> Always with the same force?</p>\n<p><strong>D-93749:</strong> Yes.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Kulzer:</strong> Noted. Please clench your fist.</p>\n<p><strong>D-93749:</strong> Okay.</p>\n<p><em>D-93749 clenches his right fist.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Kulzer:</strong> And now open it again.</p>\n<p><em>D-93749 opens his fist again. However, the glove bends his fingers backward, beyond their initial position before suddenly clenching again, just to bend them back once more. This process repeats itself again and again with increasing frequency and amplitude.</em></p>\n<p><strong>D-93749:</strong> AH! OUCH! TURN IT OFF!</p>\n<p><em>Dr. Kulzer hastily disables the power supply but his timing halts the prototype with the fingers bent far back.</em></p>\n<p><strong>D-93749:</strong> GAAAAH!</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Kulzer:</strong> Ouuuuh\u2026 MEDIC!</p>\n<p><em>Medical personnel rushes into the room to help D-93749. Dr. Kulzer meanwhile locks D-93749's controls, starts the power again, and proceeds to move the thump and the interior space for the other four fingers with his control elements into a position that allows D-93749 to take off the prototype. Every one of these movements is commented with suppressed cries from D-93749.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Kulzer:</strong> We will have to rework that\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Closing Statements:</strong> D-93749 suffered five broken finger joints because of the oscillations of the prototype and got treated accordingly. The mentioned flaws are being removed at the time.</p>\n<p><em>I think we hit a dead end with pressure sensors. The armor has a certain lag in regard to its wearer and if he tries to counteract it, these oscillations happen. My knowledge about combat is limited but I view this as unacceptable and detrimental while deployed. There is probably a reason why R.T.I. and the SKP work with neuronal connections.</em><br/>\n- Dr. Kulzer, Robotics Department</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the end, pressure sensors were discarded. The approach of a neuronal connection by R.T.I. and the SKP proved itself to be too complex for the Foundation engineers. Instead, the technological enhancements of members of the <a href=\"http://www.scp-wiki.net/church-of-the-broken-god-hub\">Church of Maxwellism</a> were studied and replicated for the use as control elements for SCP-150-DE. These elements establish a neuronal connection between humans and machines, similar to SCP-150-DE-A and SCP-150-DE-\u03a9, and enabled the exchange of information between both. Input from SCP-150-DE is directly projected into the mind of the wearer. In opposition to the original, the ports developed by the Foundation have to be surgically implanted into the user's body and connected to its central nervous system.</p>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-right\" style=\"width:300px;\"><img alt=\"surgery_surgeons_operation_medical_health_doctors_human_table-709372.jpg%21d.jpg\" class=\"image\" src=\"http://scp-wiki-de.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-150-de/surgery_surgeons_operation_medical_health_doctors_human_table-709372.jpg%21d.jpg\" style=\"width:300px;\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width:300px;\">\n<p>Agent H\u00e4usler during one of the operations preparing him for the use of SCP-150-DE.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>For these implants, users have to subject themselves to several surgical procedures. The ports are located at:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Both temples</li>\n<li>Below the shoulder between the shoulder blades</li>\n<li>Ca. 1\u00a0cm below the thorax at the spine</li>\n<li>Ca. 1\u00a0cm above the pelvis at the spine</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After the tests with Class-D personnel had been concluded, the first models of SCP-150-DE were presented. Due to the composition of their materials, the machines with a height between 2 and 2,3\u00a0m are not as heavily armored and efficient as the originals, but about 100\u00a0kg lighter, enabling them to reach the same velocities. The first models could be operated for three hours, a duration that could be expanded widely since then. The armors can be equipped with weapons which, depending on the model, can be attached at the arms, the hip, the shoulders and/or the back. An interface helps to acquire and attack targets, to navigate, to coordinate with others and to register their status. In addition, infrared vision allows navigating in total darkness, although the models do not possess haptic sensors. For deployment in areas hostile to life, all SCP-150-DE instances seal themselves hermetically, additionally, every unit carries a supply of oxygen that lasts for ca. 20 minutes and in some models up to one hour. If it isn't used, a ventilation system supplies the user with air and cools him down if necessary. With the exception of the application of stimulants, SCP-150-DE possesses no functions for keeping his wearer combat-ready, including means of medical supply.</p>\n<p>Due to the limited storage capacity of the storage media inside the armor, a less efficient AI had to be used as employed by SCP-150-DE-A or -\u03a9, even though research in this avenue is still being conducted. This AI is capable of identifying and neutralizing cognitohazards before they can take effect. It is, however, incapable of communicating with its wearer and watch the surroundings in his stead, forcing wearers to actively decide what they want to see on their interface. To circumvent this problem a little, all instances SCP-150-DE possess a proximity alert, warning of incoming projectiles and units. The exact technical specifications can be taken from Technology Report 150-DE/98T.</p>\n<p>Wearers of instances of SCP-150-DE have demonstrated several remarkable feats, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Breaking through 50\u00a0cm thick concrete walls via ramming</li>\n<li>Maintaining a constant speed of 60\u00a0km/h for a duration of 90 minutes</li>\n<li>One SCP-150-DE user eliminating and/or overpowering 11 hostile units with equipment similar to the American military standard</li>\n<li>Lifting ca. 340\u00a0kg of weight</li>\n<li>Repelling hacker attacks directed towards the armor through the dual system of human and machine</li>\n<li>Continuous combat readiness for 72 hours (with recharging of energy reserves in regular intervals)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Several models of SCP-150-DE were developed, designed for different tasks. <a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/document-150-de-argonaut\">Document 150-DE/ARGONAUT</a> contains a list of all models currently being produced.</p>\n<p>To equip SCP-150-DE the armors and the helmets are opened by electrical servo motors. Then, the user has to enter SCP-150-DE, causing the device to seal itself hermetically. Attention should be paid to the user wearing special turnout gear that does not cover the ports on the body, so the machine can connect with the subject.</p>\n<p>Probably because the controls of SCP-150-DE rely heavily on the brain of its wearer, the psyche of its users slowly transforms because the brain tries the accommodate for the unusual requirements. This transformation leads to an improvement of analytical thinking, environmental perception, multitasking and reaction speed but at the same time impairs emotional reactions and empathy to the point of complete suppression. Subjects will after a while also try to wear SCP-150-DE as often as possible, presumably because the brain adapts to the conditions of the armor and doesn't fully readjust to the stimuli outside of SCP-150-DE. Because of that, candidates for which SCP-150-DE instances are to be created, are to be informed about the side-effects to rule out later disobedience as good as possible.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><strong>Process protocol regarding the psychological development of Agent Taube</strong></p>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> The following are excerpts from the psychological evaluations SCP-150-DE users have to subject themselves to on a monthly basis.

It is as if you could take on the world in this thing. Highly unfamiliar, but I think one can get used to it.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Stier:</strong> Because of your surgeries you are obligated to not move in public. What are your thoughts on that?</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Taube:</strong> Well, I have a few USB-ports in my face now. How could I walk without everybody staring at me? Also, this place has enough to keep me happy. Have you seen the online video library? It's epic.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Stier:</strong> And in regard to your family? Your wife? Your son?</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Taube:</strong> Of course, it is regrettable, but I do it to protect them from all this stuff we deal with here. I get nightmares at the thought of Jens growing up in a world controlled by the SKP or were some sort of extremely dangerous Keter anomaly that has broken free.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Stier:</strong> I see\u2026 Can we do something for you?</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Taube:</strong> Uh, yes, can you send me a photo from Jens and Linda from time to time?

Should the user expire before the completion of the instance or if they are no longer available for other reasons, then either a fitting replacement is to be procured as fast as within the bounds of the protocol possible or the SCP-150-DE instance to be stored in at least three (3) different locations to impede theft until a new fitting user has been found. \n\n\n\nUsers of SCP-150-DE are to be chosen from trained MTF of security personnel exclusively. Significant traits for this qualification include character, psychological profile, experience, bodily fitness, physique and loyalty towards the Foundation. Their bodies are to be modified for the usage and the probands to be subjected to further training, so that they may work with the sensory input from SCP-150-DE. The exact specifications to this and the process of the selection procedure are documented in Protocol ATLAS.\n\n\n\nUsers of SCP-150-DE may not enter the public and have to remain in Foundation sites outside of deployment. Families of subjects, if existing, will be informed of their death and receive all Foundation benefits due in these circumstances. Potential candidates are to be informed about these conditions, as well as the following surgeries for the usage of SCP-150-DE and the subsequent psychological changes before the selection procedure and have to agree to them in written form.\n\n\n\nSCP-150-DE users are to be assigned to MTF DE4-\ud835\udd19 \"Die Verteidiger\" (i.e. \"The Defenders\") and are lent to other MTFs only when necessary. To this end, MTF DE4-\ud835\udd19 is to be stationed at multiple sites. MTF DE4-\ud835\udd19 itself may only move out in extreme situations, like a containment breach of an extremely dangerous anomaly or to prevent an imminent K-class scenario. On missions, SCP-150-DE instances are to be transported exclusively via police trucks or helicopter and, when practical, only to be deployed at sites where a public witnessing isn't possible. Should a discrete operation not be possible, witnesses are to be amnesticized and media depicting these objects to be censored. Alternatively, if applicable, they can be presented as advertisements for the video game //Counter Shock//, which is being developed and marketed by the Foundation front company Superior Console Performance.\n\n\n\nSCP-150-DE users must subject themselves to monthly tests to analyze their psyche. Should a user become unstable, they are to be decommissioned and to be classified as Class-E personnel until a decision regarding further steps has been reached. Acceptable methods in this regard are psychological therapy with subsequent employment as security personnel of the respective site, incarceration or, in emergencies, termination.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nShould an SCP-150-DE user expire, their remains are to be properly interred and the materials of his SCP-150-DE instance to be returned to the production cycle after thorough study. \n\n\n\nIf they are not being studied, instances of SCP-150-DE-\u0391[[footnote]]A is this case stands for the Greek letter Alpha.[[/footnote]] and SCP-150-DE-\u03a9 are to be disassembled and locked within medium value containment lockers.\n\n\n\nIf any instances of SCP-150-DE-\u0391 or SCP-150-DE-\u03a9 are encountered outside of the Foundation, they are to be confiscated or, upon retaliation, to be neutralized using heavy kinetic energy penetrators or other suitable weapons. The information in this paragraph is to be relayed to all agents involved in combat missions, regardless of the classification of this document.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-150-DE describes a series of Tactical Power Armors with anomalous properties. All currently stored or used models encase their wearer completely and make them capable of greater performance than that possible for a normal human. Some technologies used were until now not completely understood by the Foundation, although a great part of them is reproducible. \n\n\n\n**Discovery:** Since 1995, the Foundation conducts research to create a functional exoskeleton for combat missions, medical treatment, and logistics. The first non-anomalous models were finished in the year 2000, but there were several problems regarding their carrying capacity and their energy supply, rendering them unsuited for practical applications. \n\n\n\nIn 2001, the Foundation took notice of the technology of Raptor Tec. Industries and showed great interest in their Tactical Combat Armors. They not only were capable of enhancing the performance capability of their users and to suppress their emotions, but also possessed haptic sensors on all surfaces and could be equipped with different weapon systems, such as grenade launchers, cannons, or lasers. Additionally, they provided reliable protection against several environmental influences and could be linked with the neural system of their wearer, allowing support of all actions undertaken by an inbuilt AI. At this time, the Foundation didn't know that Raptor Tec. Industries worked with anomalies and was obligated by contract to not research their products. For this reason, the power armor did not recieve an SCP classification and wasn\u2019t studied. They were successfully deployed several times in controlled environments but were only used once in the field.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nDuring Incident [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/028-de-i2 #028-DE/I2], the Foundation took possession of several Tactical Power Armors of the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/skp-portal SKP], residing in a parallel universe. At the same time, when their obvious anomalous properties came to light, it was also noted that R.T.I.-Armors possessed capabilities unexplainable by the Foundation, as for example the temporary prevention of the death of a fatally wounded user and the forced take over of his body by the integrated AI. Raptor Tec. Industries were subsequently ordered to surrender to the Foundation and to hand over their anomalous technologies. Following this, the company went into hiding and from then on kept acting from the underground. Its armors were classified as SCP-150-DE-A, while the captured models of the SKP gained the designation SCP-150-DE-\u03a9.\n\n\n\nThe replication of these technologies proved difficult in the beginning until computer technicians from Site-DE03 managed to download big parts of the SKP database from R-3379-DE. While the Foundation is still not capable of understanding the basic principles of most technologies, it managed to replicate them after initial difficulties. \n\n\n\nWhile technologies like the required servomotors and general construction could be replicated one-to-one, problems arose in creating the required materials, amongst other things. R.T.I. and the SKP used materials with structures, which could either not be produced at all, only with great effort or only with high material costs. Foundation engineers were capable of substituting these materials with normal ones in most cases, but this resulted in lowered performance and resilience. For the bigger part, they could help themselves on this matter with data collected from files of Section XXV by Research Team 25, also in cases were the usage of normal materials wasn\u2019t feasible. Section XXV too had searched for stronger, lighter and especially easy to produce materials to counteract the constant shortage of resources in the GDR, basing themselves on documents of the SKP formerly residing in this universe, amongst others. \n\n\u00a0\n\nAnother problem was posed by the supply with energy. R.T.I. used a currently for replication insufficiently analyzed accumulator, while the SKP relied on a motor, whose reverse engineered Foundation prototypes don\u2019t operate stably at this time. This obstacle could be overcome with the aid of [[[SCP-156-DE]]], which delivered information on the construction and cost-effective production of glass batteries.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nSince the neuronal connection of SCP-150-DE-\u0391 or SCP-150-DE-\u03a9 could not be replicated until recently, pressure sensors on the armors inside were initially used to move the armor with the wearer. However, that resulted in unwanted oscillations. \n\n\n\n> **Test Log 150-DE/087**\n\n> \n\n> **Foreword:** In this test, the third try was undertaken to get SCP-150-DE components to mimic their wearer's movements. The test subject is a D-Class employee, whose right arm is inserted up to the shoulder in an SCP-150-DE prototype (It is a glove with the corresponding arm) fixed to a frame to not burden the test subject with the weight. The test is being conducted by Dr. Kulzer in a standard testing chamber in Site-DE12. Medical personnel is available on call.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> \n\n> <Begin Log>\n\n> \n\n> **D-93749:** A robo-arm, how awesome!\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Kulzer:** Actually, it's a glove.\n\n> \n\n> **D-93749:** Will this later become an actual suit? That would be epic. \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Kulzer:** No comment. Nine-three, I'll start the energy input now. \n\n> \n\n> //Dr. Kulzer flips the main switch on his control panel. The prototype starts to hum quietly.//\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Kulzer:** Everything alright so far?\n\n> \n\n> **D-93749:** Yeah. Everything's okay. What do I do now? \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Kulzer:** For now, normal movements. Please move the arm slowly upwards. \n\n> \n\n> **D-93749:** Gotcha.\n\n> \n\n> //D-93749 stretches his arm upwards.

I think you still have to tweak this a little bit. I pushed constantly upwards the entire time. \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Kulzer:** Always with the same force? \n\n> \n\n> **D-93749:** Yes.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Kulzer:** Noted. Please clench your fist. \n\n> \n\n> **D-93749:** Okay.\n\n> \n\n> //D-93749 clenches his right fist.//\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Kulzer:** And now open it again.\n\n> \n\n> //D-93749 opens his fist again. However, the glove bends his fingers backward, beyond their initial position before suddenly clenching again, just to bend them back once more. This process repeats itself again and again with increasing frequency and amplitude.//\n\n> \n\n> **D-93749:** AH! OUCH! TURN IT OFF!\n\n> \n\n> //Dr. Kulzer hastily disables the power supply but his timing halts the prototype with the fingers bent far back.//\n\n> \n\n> **D-93749:** GAAAAH!\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Kulzer:** Ouuuuh... MEDIC!\n\n> \n\n> //Medical personnel rushes into the room to help D-93749. Dr. Kulzer meanwhile locks D-93749's controls, starts the power again, and proceeds to move the thump and the interior space for the other four fingers with his control elements into a position that allows D-93749 to take off the prototype. Every one of these movements is commented with suppressed cries from D-93749.//\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Kulzer:** We will have to rework that...\n\n> \n\n> **Closing Statements:** D-93749 suffered five broken finger joints because of the oscillations of the prototype and got treated accordingly. The mentioned flaws are being removed at the time. \n\n> \n\n> //I think we hit a dead end with pressure sensors. The armor has a certain lag in regard to its wearer and if he tries to counteract it, these oscillations happen. My knowledge about combat is limited but I view this as unacceptable and detrimental while deployed. There is probably a reason why R.T.I. and the SKP work with neuronal connections.//\n\n> - Dr. Kulzer, Robotics Department\n\n\n\nIn the end, pressure sensors were discarded. The approach of a neuronal connection by R.T.I. and the SKP proved itself to be too complex for the Foundation engineers. Instead, the technological enhancements of members of the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/church-of-the-broken-god-hub Church of Maxwellism] were studied and replicated for the use as control elements for SCP-150-DE. These elements establish a neuronal connection between humans and machines, similar to SCP-150-DE-A and SCP-150-DE-\u03a9, and enabled the exchange of information between both. Input from SCP-150-DE is directly projected into the mind of the wearer. In opposition to the original, the ports developed by the Foundation have to be surgically implanted into the user's body and connected to its central nervous system. \n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> name=http://scp-wiki-de.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-150-de/surgery_surgeons_operation_medical_health_doctors_human_table-709372.jpg%21d.jpg|caption=Agent H\u00e4usler during one of the operations preparing him for the use of SCP-150-DE.|width=300px]]\n\n\n\nFor these implants, users have to subject themselves to several surgical procedures. The ports are located at:\n\n* Both temples\n\n* Below the shoulder between the shoulder blades \n\n* Ca. 1 cm below the thorax at the spine\n\n* Ca. 1 cm above the pelvis at the spine\n\n\u00a0\n\nAfter the tests with Class-D personnel had been concluded, the first models of SCP-150-DE were presented. Due to the composition of their materials, the machines with a height between 2 and 2,3 m are not as heavily armored and efficient as the originals, but about 100 kg lighter, enabling them to reach the same velocities. The first models could be operated for three hours, a duration that could be expanded widely since then. The armors can be equipped with weapons which, depending on the model, can be attached at the arms, the hip, the shoulders and/or the back. An interface helps to acquire and attack targets, to navigate, to coordinate with others and to register their status. In addition, infrared vision allows navigating in total darkness, although the models do not possess haptic sensors. For deployment in areas hostile to life, all SCP-150-DE instances seal themselves hermetically, additionally, every unit carries a supply of oxygen that lasts for ca. 20 minutes and in some models up to one hour. If it isn't used, a ventilation system supplies the user with air and cools him down if necessary. With the exception of the application of stimulants, SCP-150-DE possesses no functions for keeping his wearer combat-ready, including means of medical supply. \n\n\n\nDue to the limited storage capacity of the storage media inside the armor, a less efficient AI had to be used as employed by SCP-150-DE-A or -\u03a9, even though research in this avenue is still being conducted. This AI is capable of identifying and neutralizing cognitohazards before they can take effect. It is, however, incapable of communicating with its wearer and watch the surroundings in his stead, forcing wearers to actively decide what they want to see on their interface. To circumvent this problem a little, all instances SCP-150-DE possess a proximity alert, warning of incoming projectiles and units. The exact technical specifications can be taken from Technology Report 150-DE/98T.\n\n\n\nWearers of instances of SCP-150-DE have demonstrated several remarkable feats, such as:\n\n* Breaking through 50 cm thick concrete walls via ramming \n\n* Maintaining a constant speed of 60 km/h for a duration of 90 minutes\n\n* One SCP-150-DE user eliminating and/or overpowering 11 hostile units with equipment similar to the American military standard \n\n* Lifting ca. 340 kg of weight\n\n* Repelling hacker attacks directed towards the armor through the dual system of human and machine\n\n* Continuous combat readiness for 72 hours (with recharging of energy reserves in regular intervals)\n\n\n\nSeveral models of SCP-150-DE were developed, designed for different tasks. [[[Document 150-DE/ARGONAUT]]] contains a list of all models currently being produced. \n\n\n\nTo equip SCP-150-DE the armors and the helmets are opened by electrical servo motors. Then, the user has to enter SCP-150-DE, causing the device to seal itself hermetically. Attention should be paid to the user wearing special turnout gear that does not cover the ports on the body, so the machine can connect with the subject.\n\n\n\nProbably because the controls of SCP-150-DE rely heavily on the brain of its wearer, the psyche of its users slowly transforms because the brain tries the accommodate for the unusual requirements. This transformation leads to an improvement of analytical thinking, environmental perception, multitasking and reaction speed but at the same time impairs emotional reactions and empathy to the point of complete suppression. Subjects will after a while also try to wear SCP-150-DE as often as possible, presumably because the brain adapts to the conditions of the armor and doesn't fully readjust to the stimuli outside of SCP-150-DE. Because of that, candidates for which SCP-150-DE instances are to be created, are to be informed about the side-effects to rule out later disobedience as good as possible. \n\n\n\n> [[=]]\n\n> **Process protocol regarding the psychological development of Agent Taube**\n\n> [[/=]]\n\n> \n\n> **Foreword:** The following are excerpts from the psychological evaluations SCP-150-DE users have to subject themselves to on a monthly basis.

I get nightmares at the thought of Jens growing up in a world controlled by the SKP or were some sort of extremely dangerous Keter anomaly that has broken free.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Stier:** I see... Can we do something for you?\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Taube:** Uh, yes, can you send me a photo from Jens and Linda from time to time? I can't see them anymore but I still want to know about their well-being. \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Stier:** I will see what I can do. [[footnote]] The request was later approved by the Ethics Committee. However, it was at the same time decided that, in case of one or both family members expiring, Agent Taube would be receiving fakes to let him believe his family is still well, to prevent psychological instability and disobedience [[/footnote]].\n\n> \n\n> <End Log>\n\n> \n\n> [[=]]\n\n> **09/01/20\u2588\u2588**\n\n> [[/=]]\n\n> \n\n> <Begin Log>\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Stier:** Did you get used to your armor? \n\n> \n\n> **Agent Taube:** Yes, it slowly gets easier more and more.

I can't describe it in any other way. \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Stier:** You have had the armor for a month but until now, never got deployed. What are your thoughts?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Taube:** Thank God.

Do you like your life here? \n\n> \n\n> **Agent Taube:** Well, it's getting somewhat monotone to always see the same places but hey, I was informed about that beforehand, so this one's on me.\u00a0\u00a0Nice pictures you sent me, by the way. Do you think I can send part of my salary to Linda? \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Stier:** Agent Taube, you know the protocol. You're legally dead.

Does that that make you sad? \n\n> \n\n> **Agent Taube:** Hm, of course, its crap, but I am honestly relieved that there weren't more. That happened before we arrived. I couldn't have done a thing. \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Stier:** Indeed. \n\n> \n\n> **Agent Taube:** But, doctor?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Stier:** Hm?\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Taube:** I have the feeling that it should have hit me harder...

For there not being a reason for them, I mean. \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Stier:** You train regularly with your suit, even asked if the training hours can be increased. Did something change? \n\n> \n\n> **Agent Taube:** Well, I somehow don't feel whole without the thing anymore. I feel somewhat weak, vulnerable. \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Stier:** Is that the reason why you are recently seeking less contact with your colleagues? \n\n> \n\n> **Agent Taube:** I am?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Stier:** Yes, Agent. You leave your room less and less frequently and visit the recreational facilities when they are less busy. And you talk less. \n\n> \n\n> **Agent Taube:** Hm. I didn't realize that.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Stier:** Does something your colleagues do repel you? \n\n> \n\n> **Agent Taube:** No. I just don't like that may people in one place. \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Stier:** Hm. But you do cope with your restriction on this site?\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Taube:** Yes, even better than before. \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Stier:** You are not bored?\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Taube:** No.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Stier:** Your wife had her birthday yesterday.

Are you worried because you had to go out unusually often in the last months?\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Taube:** No. If something like this happens, I have to be there. I don't burden myself with sorrow.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Stier:** I've heard you go only seldomly among people now and prefer to be for yourself for self-optimization. \n\n> \n\n> **Agent Taube:** I just don't have the same interests as the rest of the staff. I have one of the hardest jobs here, even though I am rarely deployed. But if I fail on those rare occasions, it could have bad consequences. Therefore, I prefer not to waste my time. \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Stier:** Some others in MTF DE4-\ud835\udd19 have the same opinion.

Everything else doesn't motivate me as much anymore. It just feels numb and unnecessary. \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Stier:** Do you know what is happening to you?\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Taube:** Of course, I was warned of that before I was chosen for the surgery. I even had to sign that I had been warned. \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Stier:** And that doesn't worry you? \n\n> \n\n> **Agent Taube:** Not anymore.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Stier:** If your family would see you now as you are, how would you feel? \n\n> \n\n> **Agent Taube:** Linda and... uh, Jens?

I just couldn't avoid all of it. \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Stier:** And the hostages?\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Taube:** If everybody would have been evacuated on time, this wouldn't have happened. But be honest with me. The life of two children and their mother or that of a thousand people. What would you choose? \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Stier:** I would not shoot the enemy through his hostages. As far as we know, you could have, with a few seconds of changing positions- \n\n> \n\n> **Agent Taube:** You weren't there, doctor. Every second counted because we didn't have the info you have now in the aftermath.

Those armors take the humanity of their wearers. They become more like robots, drilled to fulfill their task as fast and effectively as possible. At this point, they are no more than the machines they wear. I urgently suggest we do something against that, to decrease the load those armors burden their wearers with. Otherwise, we also can right away view the Verteidiger as not just dead on paper. \n\n> //- Dr. Stier, Psychology Department//\n\n\n\nUsually, the psychological change proceeds without incident, but in rare cases the subject develops split personalities, catatonia ore paranoia, presumed to be a defensive reaction of their own psyche against the change. Five such cases are known to date of which three became violent. Especially Incident 150-DE/017Z, which occurred on a mission, resulted in 13 causalities, among them seven Foundation employees. \n\n\n\n> We have gained increased complaints from the Psychology Departments of some sites because of the condition of the SCP-150-DE users. I have to agree in the regard that we indeed did put together a bunch of psychopaths and they are one of the strongest MTF we have. They are //now// loyal but what if more than one goes rogue or a rebellion is planned? \n\n> //- O4-2//\n\n\n\n> Our technology is just not far enough to enable the same form of controls like R.T.I. and the SKP use them, although we are working on that. And even if they are psychopaths, they are, as you mentioned correctly, one of our strongest MTFs and according to calculations still not capable to go toe to toe with SCP-150-DE-A und -\u03a9 and prevail. And are surely not all the threats that the creators of those power armors can throw at us. We need more of them. I will request the Mother Foundation to lend us a few [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2000 Hominid Replicators], so we can circumvent this lengthy selection process. Also, I view the use of obedience enforcing memes or, if everything fails, [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2140 SCP-2140] for adequate to prevent an uprising. I am aware I'm proposing to brainwash or even to change the past of some of our most loyal employees but this will not even make it in the top 100 list of things that keep me awake at night. We do not do that for us but for the protection of the world. And for that, we need as much firepower as possible\n\n> //- O4-12// \n\n\n\n[[/<]]\n\n[[/<]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n[[module css]]\n\n.footnotes-footer { \n\ndisplay:none;\n\n}\n\n[[/module]]\n", "references": ["scp-156-de", "document-150-de-argonaut", "scp-062-de"], "scp": "SCP-150-DE", "scp_number": 150, "series": "international", "tags": ["_cc", "_de", "electronic", "foundation-made", "international", "military", "mind-affecting", "mobile", "scp", "thaumiel", "weapon"], "title": "SCP-150-DE", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-150-de"}, "SCP-161-JP": {"created_at": "2020-09-16T15:59:00", "creator": "INT_Translator", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "INT_Translator", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/int-translator", "comment": "Parent page set to: \"scp-international\".", "date": "2020-09-16T15:59:00"}, {"author": "INT_Translator", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/int-translator", "comment": "Added tags: auditory, international, keter, memory-affecting, meta, scp, visual.

From patients of SCP-161-JP, cognition towards the action of \u201ceyling\u201d, and concepts related to them are lost retroactively. As a result, for example a motion of a ballerina eyling around is recognized to the patients as a motion of simply spinning around single-legged, and a false memory, which guides patients to think that the motion was such so retrospectively, is created. As an extreme example, the Japanese traditional art <em>Noh</em>, which consists mostly of performers eyling and walking, is recognized to the patients as performers simply walking around with a fan in hand.</p>\n<p>Patients of SCP-161-JP that recognize words meaning \u201ceyle\u201d as a spoken sound lose all memory of the past few hours. This symptom also occurs when they sight the phonemes of the word.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Experiment Log (Excerpt) :</strong></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Hey, for how long will this \u201ctest\u201d go on?</p>\n<p><strong>Researcher:</strong> The test will be over soon.

The number of SCP-161-JP patients is still increasing, and the number is verging on the limits of the Foundation\u2019s ability to correspond.

All containment efforts are to be focused towards a Grade 3 <em>Omission</em> cover-up, coupled with the discouragement or sabotage of exploration and research missions that attempt to study cis-Mercurian space and orbits that go through it.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-179 is a humanoid entity located at a constant distance of approximately 40,000\u00a0km from the South polar region of the solar photosphere, locked to the rotation axis of Sol. However, it does not orbit it; the most recent recordings of SCP-179 indicate that it seems to maintain a continuous orbit around the center of the galaxy.</p>\n<p>Through the combined effort of 43 years of continuous surveying, the external appearance of SCP-179 has been defined as a human female of undetermined ethnic group of between twenty and forty years of age. Its entire bodily surface is covered in or composed of a matte black material. Its hair appears to be composed of this material, measures over 34\u00a0km long and is constantly pushed away by solar wind. However, this part of SCP-179 seems to reflect variable amounts of sunlight \u2014 this reflection being the phenomenon that indicated its existence to Foundation astrophysicists during 1940. Several markings or tattoos are placed throughout its bodily midline. Judging from their brightness, these markings might be of metallic composition and of a golden hue.</p>\n<p>These tattoos include several symbols that have been identified as those typically representing the Sun and the six innermost planets of the Solar System according to medieval alchemy, including, in this order:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The symbol of gold in the subject's forehead, right underneath the hair line.</li>\n<li>The symbol of mercury under the nose, circling both lips.</li>\n<li>The symbol of copper between the medial ends of its clavicles.</li>\n<li>[DATA EXPUNGED - AUTOCENSOR LEVEL SC 4 - NON-TRIVIAL COGNITOHAZARD DETECTED] with the anatomically correct shape of a human heart placed over the location where a heart would be in a female human of the same apparent age and bodily proportions.</li>\n<li>The symbol of iron in the upper abdominal region.</li>\n<li>The symbol of tin in the lower abdominal region.</li>\n<li>Part of a final symbol in the pelvic region. While the anatomy of this region makes its clear observation difficult, it has been hypothesized that the symbol of lead is also present and complete in the perineum region.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SCP-179 keeps its ventral side oriented towards Earth most of the time, but it has been observed to look towards other areas on occasion.

Only one instance of SCP-179 communication with Foundation personnel has occurred thus far, where SCP-179 proved to be fluent in French. As this contact did not result in a clear statement of SCP-179's intentions towards the Foundation and its mission, all efforts must be made to prevent contact by any known Groups of Interest with SCP-179. Misinformation operations and other preemptive measures have been deployed.</p>\n<p>Most recorded movements performed by SCP-179 have been related to extraterrestrial threats, both anomalous or non-anomalous in nature, on a collision or orbital insertion course with the Earth. These threatening items have been identified as capable of causing CK-Class Reconfiguration events of diverse impact on human societies and earthly life in general if allowed to reach Earth. If impact with Earth or orbital insertion occurs without proper response and containment by Foundation operatives, these items of interest may be capable of causing XK-Class end-of-the-world scenarios.</p>\n<p>SCP-179 will usually address an item or items of interest by pointing at them with an arm and, when more than one item of interest is present, will be able to generate additional limbs anatomically identical to its arms, as needed. Survey data indicates that SCP-179 performs other motions specific to each item of interest addressed \u2014 such as raising different fingers or moving its arms in an array of as of yet undecipherable patterns at fixed intervals \u2014, but whether these motions contain any information or not has not been determined to date.</p>\n<p>The limits of SCP-179's detection capacities have not been clearly ascertained. While SCP-179 has been able to detect potentially harmful objects beyond the trans-Neptunian region, those threats had been detected by other surveillance and exploration systems (usually under Foundation control) or, in at least three separate instances, were visible to the naked eye from Earth. However, they had not been immediately recognized as threats. It has been hypothesized that SCP-179 may only detect and react to active threats that remain detectable to other observing parties without the cis-Neptunian region, while being able to unerringly determine their harmful nature. All items of interest approaching Earth within cis-Neptunian space that had considerable destructive capacity have been detected by SCP-179 without failure, often when no observers known to the Foundation were aware of them.</p>\n<p>As such, SCP-179 and all personnel, orbital equipment and facilities dedicated to its surveillance remain the most reliable early warning system the Foundation possesses to detect and, when possible, prevent, potentially dangerous incursions within surveyed space. SCP-179 is able to determine which interplanetary objects pose a threat to Earth, humankind or the earthly biosphere, which makes it a critical asset for the Composite Orbital Early Warning System (COEWS) project of the Foundation, which currently involves SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588, SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, SCP-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, XCPOA-003 to -042<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>, Site-34, Site-103, Site-98, Area-08, Site-\u2588\u2588, Site-\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588, \u2588 and \u2588 and Command Site-\u2588\u2588, as well as several personnel embedded within different space agencies and international consortia related to space exploration. All data of interest related to or obtained through SCP-179 will be marked COEWS-179, which will be considered high priority information to all Foundation departments.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum SCP-179-01: Notable Movements of SCP-179.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>&lt;13/12/1940&gt;</strong> First recorded movement of SCP-179. The entity, that had remained with both arms crossed, raises an arm towards a previously undetected interplanetary object on a collision course with Earth. After its impact, in an event that damaged the city of [DATA EXPUNGED] extensively with large quantities of an anomalous mucous secretion and left more than one thousand and three hundred dead which, combined with the anomalous phenomena related to [REDACTED AS PER PREVIOUS EXPUNGEMENT] Remaining central item reclassified SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588. SCP-179 returned to its original position.</li>\n<li><strong>&lt;22/09/1942&gt;</strong> Sixth recorded movement of SCP-179. The entity raises an arm towards [REDACTED], on a collision course with Earth. Item of interest crashes nearby Auckland, New Zealand, on 04/10/1942. Item separates upon impact into several devices of mechanical nature. [DATA EXPUNGED] recently formed sub-entities with minimal civilian casualties. Once Foundation operatives contain the item proper, which is reclassified [REDACTED] and terminating most sub-entities, SCP-179 returns to its original position. Mobile Task Forces [REDACTED, ALL DATA ON INVOLVED ASSETS EXPUNGED FROM RECORDS] proceeds to track and destroy all remaining sub-entities.</li>\n<li><strong>&lt;\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/19\u2588\u2588&gt;</strong> Eighteenth recorded movement of SCP-179. The entity raises its right arm towards [DATA EXPUNGED]. Up to this date, the entity has kept one of its primary arms \u2014 shifting from one to the other as necessary \u2014 pointing in the same direction.</li>\n<li><strong>&lt;01/03/1949&gt;</strong> 23<sup>rd</sup> recorded movement of SCP-179. The entity raises an arm towards an Amor-class asteroid, that has adopted a collision course with Earth. The Foundation uses a combination of several SCP objects to launch a remote-controlled interplanetary vehicle that acts as a gravitatory towline; this mission is announced a success on 03/05/1951; at this time, SCP-179 returns to its original position. <em><strong>Note:</strong> Surveying elements observed that the entity performed a motion that could have been a nod. Reclassification request to Euclid status filed and denied.</em></li>\n<li><strong>&lt;13/12/1998&gt;</strong> 403<sup>rd</sup> recorded movement of SCP-179. The entity stops watching the Earth for two days and thirteen hours, when it looks towards the Jovian system. Once this interval is over, SCP-179 looks at Earth again.</li>\n<li><strong>&lt;09/09/2002&gt;</strong> 487<sup>th</sup> recorded movement of SCP-179. SCP-179 points at an armed Type-11 Dimensional Weapon [FURTHER DATA ON XCP-11-DW EXPUNGED AS PER 05-11 EXECUTIVE COMMAND] launched from Area-08 to test SCP-179's detection capacities. Item remains in a primed configuration for \u2588\u2588 minutes, ready to be launched at a test location on Earth. It is not identified by SCP-179 until it is 3,670 kilometers above the Earth's surface, when SCP-179 reacts to it as a threat and points at it. Device subsequently reconfigured to a stand-by configuration and redirected towards its primary target, [DATA EXPUNGED] still in transit from the Kuiper Belt. SCP-179 returns to its previous position.</li>\n<li><strong>&lt;16/10/2003&gt;</strong> Contact with SCP-179 is achieved via the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-2 probe. Subsequent movements registered in Addendum SCP-179-02. SCP-179 reclassified Thaumiel. See Addendum SCP-179-02.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Addendum SCP-179-02: Events of 16/10/2003.</strong></p>\n<p>SCP-179 was first approached by the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-2 probe, a microsatellite equipped with multiple recording, analysis and communications devices incorporated into the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 probe in a clandestine operation. The \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 probe acted as a relay for the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-2 probe and Foundation Mission Control.</p>\n<p>Contact and communication with the entity were not foreseen nor programmed. When visual contact with SCP-179 was established (obtaining an unprecedentedly clear, very high resolution image of its surface), the entity begins to move its lips, forming the phonemes of a greeting in spoken French. What follows is a complete translation of the exchange.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>SCP-179 / &lt;17:34:23&gt;:</strong> Hello.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-179 / &lt;17:39:38&gt;:</strong> I'm the lookout.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-179 / &lt;17:42:38&gt;:</strong> My name is Sauelsuesor. Do you like my brother? I like him too. He is big, so big.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-179 / &lt;17:43:01&gt;:</strong> And so very warm.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-179 / &lt;17:43:11&gt;:</strong> If you want to talk to me, please use your satellite to weave-talk to me. It'll be easier than coming here. Probably. (Entity remains immobile until &lt;17:55:53&gt;)</p>\n<p>(Researchers assigned to SCP-179 detect this movement. Level 3 Researcher Tomas Graham, who is fluent in French, is selected by Head Researcher [REDACTED] to conduct a possible exchange with SCP-179. The \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-2 probe is used as a radio relay from this point onward; SCP-179 is able to receive, understand and transmit radio communications. SCP-179's transmissions read as a monotone, featureless human voice that speaks in French. The subsequent exchange occurs with a 16 minutes and 39.6 seconds delay between each message, corresponding to the distance between SCP-179 and Earth and return, that will be omitted in the rest of this document.)</p>\n<p><strong>RESEARCHER GRAHAM, T:</strong> Who are you?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-179:</strong> My name is Sauelsuesor. I am the lookout. I behold. I often see. I often warn. Almost always, when I have to. That way, there is further life.</p>\n<p><strong>RESEARCHER GRAHAM, T:</strong> What do you mean, the \"lookout\"?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-179:</strong> It's me. (smiles)</p>\n<p><strong>RESEARCHER GRAHAM, T:</strong> We have noticed the significance of your movements. Who do you report to?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-179:</strong> To those who know where to look. To you. To those who want to look. Not just you. But you, too.</p>\n<p><strong>RESEARCHER GRAHAM, T:</strong> When you say brother, are you referring to the Sun?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-179:</strong> He is my brother, Sauel. He warms me up. He is caring fire and loving light. He caresses me with his arcs and his voice and renews me. He is the source of all true light. He is your source.</p>\n<p><strong>RESEARCHER GRAHAM, T:</strong> Where do you come from?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-179:</strong> I was born a child. (the entity nods towards Earth.)</p>\n<p><strong>RESEARCHER GRAHAM, T:</strong> For how long have you been in your current location?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-179:</strong> I do not want to tell you. (smiles) (SCP-179 adopts a fetal position, remains looking towards the Earth and pointing at [REDACTED]. Face of the entity remains visible from the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-2 probe)</p>\n<p><strong>RESEARCHER GRAHAM, T:</strong> How did you reach your current position? How did you acquire the properties you currently possess?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-179:</strong> I was grown into a woman. This is how I live now.</p>\n<p><strong>RESEARCHER GRAHAM, T:</strong> Could you give us further details, please?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-179:</strong> No.</p>\n<p><strong>RESEARCHER GRAHAM, T:</strong> We would like to know more about you. Why not tell us?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-179:</strong> I am sorry. I won't be yours. I can't belong to any one person.</p>\n<p><strong>RESEARCHER GRAHAM, T:</strong> The Foundation's work protects all of humanity, all life on Earth. Don't you find this work of the greatest importance?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-179:</strong> Yes. I am doing it. Look upon me and know.</p>\n<p><strong>RESEARCHER GRAHAM, T:</strong> If we have understood your capacities correctly, we believe you could do far more than that. Sharing all the information you have, not just about the dangerous threats against humankind and Earth, could be of great benefit to all parts involved.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-179:</strong> I am too big, and you are too small. There is a sea of nothing and islands of light. I am their shore. To you come the monsters. The pounding fists of void. The longing gods beyond our knowledge. I am the lookout. I see the ripples in their wake. You want me to pledge my sight-know to you, only to you, so you, only you, can be greater. Even if you find, restrain, defend. You want me to be yours. That is not why I am here. There are others. Others I assist. Others I warn. Others beyond your thin walls of grey, dry paste-rock. Others beyond the reach of your weary satellites. Others beyond the home, our home. Others I know. Others I love. Others you won't care for. Others that came before. And, over all, others beyond the little walls of rules and bone and laws and flesh and memories and oaths you build around yourselves until you don't even remember them. Others I love. Dearly. And yet, only my brother is an equal to me.</p>\n<p><strong>RESEARCHER GRAHAM, T:</strong> Excuse me, I don't understand what you mean by \"others.\" Could you, please, explain yourself with other words?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-179:</strong> (smiles) But I have no words left.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Closing:</strong> Despite several communication attempts, SCP-179 did not perform any other movements nor transmit other messages. Up to this date, SCP-179 has not responded to any message coming from any Foundation contact team or any other efforts from known Groups of Interest.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"footnotes-footer\">\n<div class=\"title\">Footnotes</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-1\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-1')\">1</a>.

All containment efforts are to be focused towards a Grade 3 //Omission// cover-up, coupled with the discouragement or sabotage of exploration and research missions that attempt to study cis-Mercurian space and orbits that go through it.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-179 is a humanoid entity located at a constant distance of approximately 40,000 km from the South polar region of the solar photosphere, locked to the rotation axis of Sol. However, it does not orbit it; the most recent recordings of SCP-179 indicate that it seems to maintain a continuous orbit around the center of the galaxy.\n\n\n\nThrough the combined effort of 43 years of continuous surveying, the external appearance of SCP-179 has been defined as a human female of undetermined ethnic group of between twenty and forty years of age. Its entire bodily surface is covered in or composed of a matte black material. Its hair appears to be composed of this material, measures over 34 km long and is constantly pushed away by solar wind. However, this part of SCP-179 seems to reflect variable amounts of sunlight -- this reflection being the phenomenon that indicated its existence to Foundation astrophysicists during 1940. Several markings or tattoos are placed throughout its bodily midline. Judging from their brightness, these markings might be of metallic composition and of a golden hue. \n\n\n\nThese tattoos include several symbols that have been identified as those typically representing the Sun and the six innermost planets of the Solar System according to medieval alchemy, including, in this order:\n\n* The symbol of gold in the subject's forehead, right underneath the hair line.\n\n* The symbol of mercury under the nose, circling both lips.\n\n* The symbol of copper between the medial ends of its clavicles.\n\n* [DATA EXPUNGED - AUTOCENSOR LEVEL SC 4 - NON-TRIVIAL COGNITOHAZARD DETECTED] with the anatomically correct shape of a human heart placed over the location where a heart would be in a female human of the same apparent age and bodily proportions.\n\n* The symbol of iron in the upper abdominal region.\n\n* The symbol of tin in the lower abdominal region.\n\n* Part of a final symbol in the pelvic region. While the anatomy of this region makes its clear observation difficult, it has been hypothesized that the symbol of lead is also present and complete in the perineum region.\n\n\n\nSCP-179 keeps its ventral side oriented towards Earth most of the time, but it has been observed to look towards other areas on occasion.

All involved personnel with a clearance level below 4/179 will be either promoted or reassigned to fit this new classification, depending on their relevance for the continuated surveillance and cover-up operations as directed by the current Head Researcher for SCP-179. All reassigned personnel will be subject to POLYMATH-08 Memory Redaction Therapy or D-class amnestics (in a high dosage grade, with a maximum retrograde effect of ten years of experience), depending on the time spent working in SCP-179 prior to its reclassification.\n\n\n\nSCP-179's existence will be subject to an //Orbital Misinformation Standardized Intelligence Obstruction and Neutralization// campaign. As per //Omission// Protocol 4 (items 4.5, 4.6 and 4.7), most documentation related to SCP-179 has been classified Level 4 (Top Secret). Any further data related to SCP-179 has been classified Level 5 (Thaumiel), and will be made available only to authorized 5/179 personnel. \n\n\n\n**BE ADVISED THAT:** Unauthorized access to SCP-179 research materials will be considered a Type-3-B offense (Unauthorized Data Management While Lacking Appropriate Global Clearance), punishable by compulsory memory redaction therapy with immediate reassignment and/or demotion. \n\n[[/==]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"++ WARNING! UNAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL WILL BE EXPOSED TO A MEMETIC DEFENSE AGENT\" hide=\"-- GENERATING MEMETIC DEFENSE - GESTALT ABRADER ACTIVE\"]] \n\n\u00a0\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[image SCP-AN-ME-993.png width=\"600px\"]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\u00a0\n\nSCP-179 is sensitive to all radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum, intelligent and able to communicate through multiple anomalous means, including but not limited to radio and laser communications interference. Only one instance of SCP-179 communication with Foundation personnel has occurred thus far, where SCP-179 proved to be fluent in French. As this contact did not result in a clear statement of SCP-179's intentions towards the Foundation and its mission, all efforts must be made to prevent contact by any known Groups of Interest with SCP-179. Misinformation operations and other preemptive measures have been deployed.\n\n\n\nMost recorded movements performed by SCP-179 have been related to extraterrestrial threats, both anomalous or non-anomalous in nature, on a collision or orbital insertion course with the Earth. These threatening items have been identified as capable of causing CK-Class Reconfiguration events of diverse impact on human societies and earthly life in general if allowed to reach Earth. If impact with Earth or orbital insertion occurs without proper response and containment by Foundation operatives, these items of interest may be capable of causing XK-Class end-of-the-world scenarios. \n\n\n\nSCP-179 will usually address an item or items of interest by pointing at them with an arm and, when more than one item of interest is present, will be able to generate additional limbs anatomically identical to its arms, as needed. Survey data indicates that SCP-179 performs other motions specific to each item of interest addressed -- such as raising different fingers or moving its arms in an array of as of yet undecipherable patterns at fixed intervals --, but whether these motions contain any information or not has not been determined to date.\n\n\n\nThe limits of SCP-179's detection capacities have not been clearly ascertained. While SCP-179 has been able to detect potentially harmful objects beyond the trans-Neptunian region, those threats had been detected by other surveillance and exploration systems (usually under Foundation control) or, in at least three separate instances, were visible to the naked eye from Earth. However, they had not been immediately recognized as threats. It has been hypothesized that SCP-179 may only detect and react to active threats that remain detectable to other observing parties without the cis-Neptunian region, while being able to unerringly determine their harmful nature. All items of interest approaching Earth within cis-Neptunian space that had considerable destructive capacity have been detected by SCP-179 without failure, often when no observers known to the Foundation were aware of them.\n\n\n\nAs such, SCP-179 and all personnel, orbital equipment and facilities dedicated to its surveillance remain the most reliable early warning system the Foundation possesses to detect and, when possible, prevent, potentially dangerous incursions within surveyed space. SCP-179 is able to determine which interplanetary objects pose a threat to Earth, humankind or the earthly biosphere, which makes it a critical asset for the Composite Orbital Early Warning System (COEWS) project of the Foundation, which currently involves SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588, SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, SCP-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, XCPOA-003 to -042[[footnote]]Experimental Foundation Orbital Assets (XCPOA).[[/footnote]], Site-34, Site-103, Site-98, Area-08, Site-\u2588\u2588, Site-\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588, \u2588 and \u2588 and Command Site-\u2588\u2588, as well as several personnel embedded within different space agencies and international consortia related to space exploration. All data of interest related to or obtained through SCP-179 will be marked COEWS-179, which will be considered high priority information to all Foundation departments.\n\n\n\n**Addendum SCP-179-01: Notable Movements of SCP-179.**\n\n* **<13/12/1940>** First recorded movement of SCP-179. The entity, that had remained with both arms crossed, raises an arm towards a previously undetected interplanetary object on a collision course with Earth. After its impact, in an event that damaged the city of [DATA EXPUNGED] extensively with large quantities of an anomalous mucous secretion and left more than one thousand and three hundred dead which, combined with the anomalous phenomena related to [REDACTED AS PER PREVIOUS EXPUNGEMENT] Remaining central item reclassified SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588. SCP-179 returned to its original position. \n\n* **<22/09/1942>** Sixth recorded movement of SCP-179. The entity raises an arm towards [REDACTED], on a collision course with Earth. Item of interest crashes nearby Auckland, New Zealand, on 04/10/1942. Item separates upon impact into several devices of mechanical nature. [DATA EXPUNGED] recently formed sub-entities with minimal civilian casualties. Once Foundation operatives contain the item proper, which is reclassified [REDACTED] and terminating most sub-entities, SCP-179 returns to its original position. Mobile Task Forces [REDACTED, ALL DATA ON INVOLVED ASSETS EXPUNGED FROM RECORDS] proceeds to track and destroy all remaining sub-entities. \n\n* **<\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/19\u2588\u2588>** Eighteenth recorded movement of SCP-179. The entity raises its right arm towards [DATA EXPUNGED]. Up to this date, the entity has kept one of its primary arms -- shifting from one to the other as necessary -- pointing in the same direction. \n\n* **<01/03/1949>** 23^^rd^^ recorded movement of SCP-179. The entity raises an arm towards an Amor-class asteroid, that has adopted a collision course with Earth. The Foundation uses a combination of several SCP objects to launch a remote-controlled interplanetary vehicle that acts as a gravitatory towline; this mission is announced a success on 03/05/1951; at this time, SCP-179 returns to its original position. //**Note:** Surveying elements observed that the entity performed a motion that could have been a nod. Reclassification request to Euclid status filed and denied.//\n\n* **<13/12/1998>** 403^^rd^^ recorded movement of SCP-179. The entity stops watching the Earth for two days and thirteen hours, when it looks towards the Jovian system. Once this interval is over, SCP-179 looks at Earth again.\n\n* **<09/09/2002>** 487^^th^^ recorded movement of SCP-179. SCP-179 points at an armed Type-11 Dimensional Weapon [FURTHER DATA ON XCP-11-DW EXPUNGED AS PER 05-11 EXECUTIVE COMMAND] launched from Area-08 to test SCP-179's detection capacities. Item remains in a primed configuration for \u2588\u2588 minutes, ready to be launched at a test location on Earth. It is not identified by SCP-179 until it is 3,670 kilometers above the Earth's surface, when SCP-179 reacts to it as a threat and points at it. Device subsequently reconfigured to a stand-by configuration and redirected towards its primary target, [DATA EXPUNGED] still in transit from the Kuiper Belt. SCP-179 returns to its previous position.\n\n* **<16/10/2003>** Contact with SCP-179 is achieved via the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-2 probe. Subsequent movements registered in Addendum SCP-179-02. SCP-179 reclassified Thaumiel. See Addendum SCP-179-02.\n\n\n\n**Addendum SCP-179-02: Events of 16/10/2003.**\n\n\n\nSCP-179 was first approached by the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-2 probe, a microsatellite equipped with multiple recording, analysis and communications devices incorporated into the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 probe in a clandestine operation. The\u00a0\u00a0\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 probe acted as a relay for the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-2 probe and Foundation Mission Control.\n\n\n\nContact and communication with the entity were not foreseen nor programmed. When visual contact with SCP-179 was established (obtaining an unprecedentedly clear, very high resolution image of its surface), the entity begins to move its lips, forming the phonemes of a greeting in spoken French. What follows is a complete translation of the exchange. \n\n\n\n> **SCP-179 / <17:34:23>:** Hello. \n\n> \n\n> **SCP-179 / <17:39:38>:** I'm the lookout. \n\n> \n\n> **SCP-179 / <17:42:38>:** My name is Sauelsuesor. Do you like my brother? I like him too. He is big, so big. \n\n> \n\n> **SCP-179 / <17:43:01>:** And so very warm. \n\n> \n\n> **SCP-179 / <17:43:11>:** If you want to talk to me, please use your satellite to weave-talk to me. It'll be easier than coming here. Probably. (Entity remains immobile until <17:55:53>)\n\n> \n\n> (Researchers assigned to SCP-179 detect this movement. Level 3 Researcher Tomas Graham, who is fluent in French, is selected by Head Researcher [REDACTED] to conduct a possible exchange with SCP-179. The \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-2 probe is used as a radio relay from this point onward; SCP-179 is able to receive, understand and transmit radio communications. SCP-179's transmissions read as a monotone, featureless human voice that speaks in French. The subsequent exchange occurs with a 16 minutes and 39.6 seconds delay between each message, corresponding to the distance between SCP-179 and Earth and return, that will be omitted in the rest of this document.)\n\n> \n\n> **RESEARCHER GRAHAM, T:** Who are you?\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-179:** My name is Sauelsuesor. I am the lookout. I behold. I often see. I often warn. Almost always, when I have to. That way, there is further life.\n\n> \n\n> **RESEARCHER GRAHAM, T:** What do you mean, the \"lookout\"?\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-179:** It's me. (smiles)\n\n> \n\n> **RESEARCHER GRAHAM, T:** We have noticed the significance of your movements. Who do you report to?\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-179:** To those who know where to look. To you. To those who want to look. Not just you. But you, too.\n\n> \n\n> **RESEARCHER GRAHAM, T:** When you say brother, are you referring to the Sun?\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-179:** He is my brother, Sauel. He warms me up. He is caring fire and loving light. He caresses me with his arcs and his voice and renews me. He is the source of all true light. He is your source.\n\n> \n\n> **RESEARCHER GRAHAM, T:** Where do you come from?\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-179:** I was born a child. (the entity nods towards Earth.)\n\n> \n\n> **RESEARCHER GRAHAM, T:** For how long have you been in your current location?\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-179:** I do not want to tell you. (smiles) (SCP-179 adopts a fetal position, remains looking towards the Earth and pointing at [REDACTED]. Face of the entity remains visible from the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-2 probe)\n\n> \n\n> **RESEARCHER GRAHAM, T:** How did you reach your current position? How did you acquire the properties you currently possess?\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-179:** I was grown into a woman. This is how I live now.\n\n> \n\n> **RESEARCHER GRAHAM, T:** Could you give us further details, please?\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-179:** No. \n\n> \n\n> **RESEARCHER GRAHAM, T:** We would like to know more about you. Why not tell us?\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-179:** I am sorry. I won't be yours. I can't belong to any one person.\n\n> \n\n> **RESEARCHER GRAHAM, T:** The Foundation's work protects all of humanity, all life on Earth. Don't you find this work of the greatest importance?\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-179:** Yes. I am doing it. Look upon me and know.\n\n> \n\n> **RESEARCHER GRAHAM, T:** If we have understood your capacities correctly, we believe you could do far more than that. Sharing all the information you have, not just about the dangerous threats against humankind and Earth, could be of great benefit to all parts involved.\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-179:** I am too big, and you are too small. There is a sea of nothing and islands of light. I am their shore. To you\u00a0\u00a0come the monsters. The pounding fists of void. The longing gods beyond our knowledge. I am the lookout. I see the ripples in their wake. You want me to pledge my sight-know to you, only to you, so you, only you, can be greater. Even if you find, restrain, defend. You want me to be yours. That is not why I am here. There are others. Others I assist. Others I warn. Others beyond your thin walls of grey, dry paste-rock. Others beyond the reach of your weary satellites. Others beyond the home, our home. Others I know. Others I love. Others you won't care for. Others that came before. And, over all, others beyond the little walls of rules and bone and laws and flesh and memories and oaths you build around yourselves until you don't even remember them. Others I love. Dearly. And yet, only my brother is an equal to me. \n\n> \n\n> **RESEARCHER GRAHAM, T:** Excuse me, I don't understand what you mean by \"others.\" Could you, please, explain yourself with other words?\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-179:** (smiles) But I have no words left.\n\n\n\n**Closing:** Despite several communication attempts, SCP-179 did not perform any other movements nor transmit other messages.

The radius of the exclusion zone should be 5\u00a0km greater than the radius of the zone of effect. Public access to the exclusion zone is to be officially forbidden under the pretext of contamination caused by illegal dumping of radioactive waste. Once every three months, surveillance teams may deposit mildly radioactive substances within the exclusion zone and outside the zone of effect as necessary to maintain this cover.</p>\n<p>The exclusion zone should be kept under constant surveillance. Observation of SCP-185-FR instances should take place via high-magnification cameras installed around the zone of effect. At this time, only SCP-185-FR-02 and SCP-185-FR-03 are being monitored in this manner. This surveillance ring should be redrawn as necessary to stay around the perimeter of the zone of effect as it expands. Areas affected by SCP-185-FR are to be demarcated and patrolled daily using two (2) disarmed VAB Mk3 RDT transports. However, flyovers in these areas are prohibited.</p>\n<p>Surveillance teams shall consist of twenty-five members armed by the Department of Security and clad in military uniforms. These teams are to be rotated every three months, and will be based out of a mobile bunker, which will serve as their command center. If the growth of the zone of effect puts the command center within the new exclusion zone, it should be moved to a suitable location outside the exclusion zone.</p>\n<p>In the case of a potential reflux, surveillance teams must evacuate any human and animal corpses. Animals or humans caught in the zone of effect should not be recovered. Potential witnesses of a capture event are to be administered Class C amnestics and given hypnotherapy to implant false memories of attacks by wildlife, accidents, or any other scenario that could plausibly cause the death or disappearance of SCP-185-FR's victims.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-185-FR is a cluster of anomalies present in the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Forest on the border between Poland and Belarus. This group is presently comprised of five instances designated SCP-185-FR-01 through SCP-185-FR-05.</p>\n<p>Each instance differs slightly from every other in its physical form, though not in its anomalous effects. Overall, instances of SCP-185-FR appear as pole-like metallic structures supporting an animated assembly that vaguely resembles a stylized sun. Their height ranges from six (6) to fourteen (14) meters, while their diameter ranges from three (3) to five (5) meters.

The radius of the exclusion zone should be 5 km greater than the radius of the zone of effect. Public access to the exclusion zone is to be officially forbidden under the pretext of contamination caused by illegal dumping of radioactive waste. Once every three months, surveillance teams may deposit mildly radioactive substances within the exclusion zone and outside the zone of effect as necessary to maintain this cover.\n\n\n\nThe exclusion zone should be kept under constant surveillance. Observation of SCP-185-FR instances should take place via high-magnification cameras installed around the zone of effect. At this time, only SCP-185-FR-02 and SCP-185-FR-03 are being monitored in this manner. This surveillance ring should be redrawn as necessary to stay around the perimeter of the zone of effect as it expands. Areas affected by SCP-185-FR are to be demarcated and patrolled daily using two (2) disarmed VAB Mk3 RDT transports. However, flyovers in these areas are prohibited. \n\n\n\nSurveillance teams shall consist of twenty-five members armed by the Department of Security and clad in military uniforms. These teams are to be rotated every three months, and will be based out of a mobile bunker, which will serve as their command center. If the growth of the zone of effect puts the command center within the new exclusion zone, it should be moved to a suitable location outside the exclusion zone.\n\n\n\nIn the case of a potential reflux, surveillance teams must evacuate any human and animal corpses. Animals or humans caught in the zone of effect should not be recovered. Potential witnesses of a capture event are to be administered Class C amnestics and given hypnotherapy to implant false memories of attacks by wildlife, accidents, or any other scenario that could plausibly cause the death or disappearance of SCP-185-FR's victims.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-185-FR is a cluster of anomalies present in the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Forest on the border between Poland and Belarus. This group is presently comprised of five instances designated SCP-185-FR-01 through SCP-185-FR-05.\n\n\n\nEach instance differs slightly from every other in its physical form, though not in its anomalous effects. Overall, instances of SCP-185-FR appear as pole-like metallic structures supporting an animated assembly that vaguely resembles a stylized sun. Their height ranges from six (6) to fourteen (14) meters, while their diameter ranges from three (3) to five (5) meters. Collecting samples of the material composition of these instances is precluded by the effect of SCP-185-FR, which renders any approach physically impossible.\n\n\n\n--SCP-185-FR's area of effect varies between thirty (30) and fifty (50) meters each.-- Since the manifestation of SCP-185-FR-03, SCP-185-FR's area of effect covers seven and a half (7.5) square kilometers, partially delimited by the five (5) instances. This area of effect fluctuates in unpredictable ways between the instances, with variations able to reach up to one-hundred and fifty (150) meters. The duration between the fluctuations can vary from several hours to several days.\n\n\n\n--Any and all forms of movement are impossible inside SCP-185-FR's area of effect, except by SCP-185-FR instances themselves.-- All manner of kinetic energy is nullified inside SCP-185-FR's area of effect: any object or lifeform caught within the zone during a fluctuation event is instantly frozen in place. In spite of this, gravitational forces still work within the zone, affecting objects and lifeforms alike. As such, a ball thrown into the zone during a fluctuation event will abruptly halt and fall to the ground. Due to the absence of kinetic forces, it is impossible to retrieve lifeforms trapped within the zone. Lifeforms trapped inside do not appear to decompose, even if they are deceased.\n\n\n\nDuring a fluctuation event, the zone's event horizon appears as a vibrating invisible wall, and becomes impossible to traverse. The only movements to have been detected within the zone is that of the various instances of SCP-185-FR. \n\n\n\nSince the appearance of SCP-185-FR-03, the area of effect has increased in an irregular manner with each new instance. Even though the time lapse between each new manifestation grows longer with each event, each new manifestation has corresponded with a significant expansion of SCP-185-FR's area of effect. Researchers estimate that by 2019 the zone will have reached the town of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and that it will have been partially or completely trapped within the anomalous area of effect by 2025.

To aid this cover story, a steel frame structure wrapped in opaque polymer sheets is built around SCP-188-KO. Civilian access should be restricted from entering the building. The crane's hoisting motor is to be covered with sound insulation to prevent any noise the motor makes from leaking outside.</p>\n<p>The global nature of SCP-188-KO's effects calls for concentrated efforts on public information containment. The Foundation plants undercover agents in academies covering SCP-188-KO's effect related fields, such as geology, climatology, and astronomy. These agents are then to destroy or manipulate any information related to SCP-188-KO through amnestics and manipulating academic papers. However, information containment seems difficult after prolonged operation of SCP-188-KO, when the crane's anomaly becomes obvious to the general public.</p>\n<p>The long-term hazards that SCP-188-KO poses, triggered research to destroy or deactivate the tower crane safely. Agents with related research data are to report to rank 4/188 researchers.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-188-KO is a \u2588\u2588 metre tall T-shaped tower crane located in [REDACTED], Samoa. Its frame is composed of an unknown metal, which can not be destroyed by other methods than melting it with high heat.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> SCP-188-KO's hoisting device<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> is surrounded by metal plates, and is the only part of SCP-188-KO that cannot be destroyed. No equipment in the operating room except for the internal control panel functions, but the elevator functions normally. SCP-188-KO's foundation seems to reach a depth of over \u2588 kilometres.</p>\n<p>SCP-188-KO's exposed wire rope is approximately 6377.5 kilometres long, extended underground through a hole about 1 metre in diameter, located in front of the crane's foundation. The internal control panel indicates that the tip of the wire(referred to as 'hook' in this document) is currently 6377.4 kilometres underground. However, direct observation of the hook is unavailable due to its immense depth.</p>\n<p>SCP-188-KO pulls its wire for one second from 12:00 PST(noon) every day. The pulled wire rope appears to be reeled into the hoisting device's wire drum, but the volume and mass of the device do not change. The pulling speed is very slow, approximating at 0.05 millimetres per second. The Earth's centre of gravity follows up the hook, 0.05 millimetres daily, or 1.8 centimetres annually, causing global changes in the atmospherical and oceanic currents. To date, the gravitational centre of the Earth has shifted approximately \u2588\u2588 metres towards SCP-188-KO from its original position.</p>\n<p>The shift in gravity resulted in sea levels in the Pacific ocean rising twice as fast as the estimates based on global warming and slowly drawing in polar glaciers towards the pacific. Also, the moon's slight movement and small differences in atmospheric pressure between the Pacific and Atlantic have been observed. Moreover, the island itself that SCP-188-KO currently stands on is likely to be completely submerged underwater in at least \u2588\u2588 years. It's being considered covering it with large waterproof barriers to prevent damage to SCP-188-KO. Calculations from the hook's movement speed estimate that the crane will cause a prolonged XK-Class End-of-the-World scenario until 2\u2588\u2588\u2588.</p>\n<p>Destruction of the wire rope by melting it has been proposed after SCP-188-KO was proven dangerous. However, the proposal was temporarily rejected, as the 'pulled gravitational centre' 'crashing' to the centre of the Earth may cause [DATA EXPUNGED] on a global scale.</p>\n<p>SCP-188-KO was found in a construction site in [REDACTED], Samoa. Local civilians reported that SCP-188-KO appeared 'out of the blue', but is without further evidence as no nearby cameras were recording the subject. The locals were treated with class-4 amnestic treatment.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes-footer\">\n<div class=\"title\">Footnotes</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-1\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-1')\">1</a>.

Frequencies known to be used by SCP-206 are to be monitored, and all images relayed to Earth via other probes or satellites deleted from non-Foundation assets after they have been retrieved. Technology and astronomy websites, journals and periodicals are to be monitored for discussion of the rover or the receipt of unusual photographs (see Document 206-AA12 for complete list). Persons who become aware of the existence of SCP-206 are to be administered amnestics.</p>\n<p>UPDATE - 30/11/20\u2588\u2588: As orbital observation of SCP-206 has proven possible, agents within satellite and aerial imaging organizations are directed to keep watch for instances of SCP-206, and remove the images concerned. Deployment of 'image corruption' cover story suggested.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-206 is a Martian exploratory rover (Designation - <em>Invictus</em>) launched on 12/08/20\u2588\u2588 as part of a joint Russian Space Research Institute / European Space Agency effort. (Exact object specifications are listed in Document 206-AA1.) Despite a successful launch aboard a <em>Soyuz-FG</em> rocket, telemetry data was lost on 16/01/20\u2588\u2588, roughly halfway to Mars. Attempts to re-establish communication failed, and on 10/02/20\u2588\u2588 the craft was declared lost.</p>\n<p>On 08/06/20\u2588\u2588 (a day after <em>Invictus</em> was planned to arrive on the Martian surface) a connection was established with ESA flight control on the rover's assigned frequency. Before terminating at the source, 38 photographs were transmitted, appearing to show views of the expected landing zone in the Victoria Crater. Three days later, a further batch of 11 images was received, showing a drastically different location (later determined to be in the Cydonia Mensae, roughly 2500km due south).</p>\n<p>The Foundation was informed of the incidents by operatives at the ESA shortly thereafter, and moved to investigate. Containment procedures were instituted on 21/06/20\u2588\u2588, when ESA Control received a batch of 5 images showing panoramic views of the Martian surface, apparently taken from its satellite Deimos. How the rover (which, as designed, is rated at maximum speed of 90m per hour on flat ground) traveled between these locations is currently unknown.</p>\n<p>SCP-206 contacts Earth sporadically, utilizing its original channel, [DATA REDACTED]. Once a connection is established, it uploads a number of images in varying formats. Pictures received do not always correspond to the hardware originally installed on <em>Invictus</em>, though the signature and session initiation packets match those programmed.</p>\n<p>Tracking stations have received a total of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 images. A large number of these images (roughly 38%) appear to have been taken on Earth, or worlds similar to it (differing in some detail). The remaining photographs seem to have been taken on, or in the region of, various celestial bodies, only a small percentage of which are currently identified. Periods between transmission vary considerably; the shortest registered to date is 26 hours, the longest 511 hours.</p>\n<p>Despite visual confirmation of the existence of something resembling the rover (see Addendum 206-1) no trace of it has been found in the received images, even when the scene includes a reflective surface. Further, a number of photographs show locations exceedingly difficult, if not impossible for a rover the size and shape of <em>Invictus</em> to access.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 206-01:</strong> At the time containment procedures were instituted, it was unknown whether the transmissions originated from the probe itself, or if an unknown entity had simply co-opted the frequency and was impersonating the rover.</p>\n<p>However, on 13/08/20\u2588\u2588, SCP-206 transmitted a photograph of what was identified as a portion of a Lunar Ranging Retro Reflector. Nearby orbital assets were re-tasked to survey the relevant regions, revealing tracks closely resembling those a rover the size and shape of <em>Invictus</em> could be expected to leave. On 30/11/20\u2588\u2588 Japanese lunar orbiter <em>SELENE</em> captured the vehicle itself during a camera calibration session over the Copernicus Crater. Four hours later, SCP-206 uploaded a new image showing a view of the same region. Since then, SCP-206 has been captured by several satellites in various locales - see Sighting Log SCP-206.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 206-02:</strong> Though SCP-206 generally uses [DATA REDACTED], on at least 5 occasions images have been transmitted to (or via) civilian or military space assets. No connection between the image sets in question has been found. See Incident Log SCP-206 for more details.</p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Archive\u00a0of\u00a0images\u00a0sent\u00a0by\u00a0SCP-206</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Archive\u00a0of\u00a0images\u00a0sent\u00a0by\u00a0SCP-206</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>Date</th>\n<th>Number of Images</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Images</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>07/06/20\u2588\u2588</td>\n<td>38</td>\n<td>The image sent appears to document SCP-206's landing on Mars.

Frequencies known to be used by SCP-206 are to be monitored, and all images relayed to Earth via other probes or satellites deleted from non-Foundation assets after they have been retrieved. Technology and astronomy websites, journals and periodicals are to be monitored for discussion of the rover or the receipt of unusual photographs (see Document 206-AA12 for complete list). Persons who become aware of the existence of SCP-206 are to be administered amnestics.\n\n\n\nUPDATE - 30/11/20\u2588\u2588: As orbital observation of SCP-206 has proven possible, agents within satellite and aerial imaging organizations are directed to keep watch for instances of SCP-206, and remove the images concerned. Deployment of 'image corruption' cover story suggested.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-206 is a Martian exploratory rover (Designation - //Invictus//) launched on 12/08/20\u2588\u2588 as part of a joint Russian Space Research Institute / European Space Agency effort. (Exact object specifications are listed in Document 206-AA1.) Despite a successful launch aboard a //Soyuz-FG// rocket, telemetry data was lost on 16/01/20\u2588\u2588, roughly halfway to Mars. Attempts to re-establish communication failed, and on 10/02/20\u2588\u2588 the craft was declared lost.\n\n\n\nOn 08/06/20\u2588\u2588 (a day after //Invictus// was planned to arrive on the Martian surface) a connection was established with ESA flight control on the rover's assigned frequency. Before terminating at the source, 38 photographs were transmitted, appearing to show views of the expected landing zone in the Victoria Crater. Three days later, a further batch of 11 images was received, showing a drastically different location (later determined to be in the Cydonia Mensae, roughly 2500km due south).\n\n\n\nThe Foundation was informed of the incidents by operatives at the ESA shortly thereafter, and moved to investigate. Containment procedures were instituted on 21/06/20\u2588\u2588, when ESA Control received a batch of 5 images showing panoramic views of the Martian surface, apparently taken from its satellite Deimos. How the rover (which, as designed, is rated at maximum speed of 90m per hour on flat ground) traveled between these locations is currently unknown.\n\n\n\nSCP-206 contacts Earth sporadically, utilizing its original channel, [DATA REDACTED]. Once a connection is established, it uploads a number of images in varying formats. Pictures received do not always correspond to the hardware originally installed on //Invictus//, though the signature and session initiation packets match those programmed.\n\n\n\nTracking stations have received a total of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 images. A large number of these images (roughly 38%) appear to have been taken on Earth, or worlds similar to it (differing in some detail). The remaining photographs seem to have been taken on, or in the region of, various celestial bodies, only a small percentage of which are currently identified. Periods between transmission vary considerably; the shortest registered to date is 26 hours, the longest 511 hours. \n\n\n\nDespite visual confirmation of the existence of something resembling the rover (see Addendum 206-1) no trace of it has been found in the received images, even when the scene includes a reflective surface. Further, a number of photographs show locations exceedingly difficult, if not impossible for a rover the size and shape of //Invictus// to access.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 206-01:** At the time containment procedures were instituted, it was unknown whether the transmissions originated from the probe itself, or if an unknown entity had simply co-opted the frequency and was impersonating the rover. \n\n\n\nHowever, on 13/08/20\u2588\u2588, SCP-206 transmitted a photograph of what was identified as a portion of a Lunar Ranging Retro Reflector. Nearby orbital assets were re-tasked to survey the relevant regions, revealing tracks closely resembling those a rover the size and shape of //Invictus// could be expected to leave. On 30/11/20\u2588\u2588 Japanese lunar orbiter //SELENE// captured the vehicle itself during a camera calibration session over the Copernicus Crater. Four hours later, SCP-206\u00a0\u00a0uploaded a new image showing a view of the same region. Since then, SCP-206 has been captured by several satellites in various locales - see Sighting Log SCP-206.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 206-02:** Though SCP-206 generally uses [DATA REDACTED], on at least 5 occasions images have been transmitted to (or via) civilian or military space assets. No connection between the image sets in question has been found. See Incident Log SCP-206 for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Archive of images sent by SCP-206\" hide=\"Archive of images sent by SCP-206\"]]\n\n\n\n\n\n||~ Date ||~ Number of Images||~ Description ||~ Images ||\n\n|| 07/06/20\u2588\u2588 || 38 || The image sent appears to document SCP-206's landing on Mars.

Due to the immense benefit it provides, there are also no plans to infiltrate the facility, although known entrances to SCP-208-DE are being monitored for the appearance of any Persons of Interest. If authorised by an O4 Council Member, Foundation Personnel can receive treatment at SCP-208-DE.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-208-DE is the St. Caesarius<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> Hospital. In contrast to regular clinics, the main focus of SCP-208-DE is the treatment of anomalous diseases, and the provision of care to members of the paranormal community. The operator of the facility appears to be the World Parahealth Organisation (WPHO), one of the member organisations of the GOC. Care costs between 200 and 5000 Euros, but is qualitatively above the German standard and available to anyone. This includes members of organisations hostile to the GOC, including members of the Church of the Broken God, the Syndicate<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> and even the Serpent's Hand. This neutrality stems from the anomaly's location within the <a href=\"http://scp-int.wikidot.com/nexus-series#sjhlfels\">Sjhlfel am Rhein Nexus</a>.</p>\n<p>The building's 35 meter high facade is assembled from 1.5\u00a0m<sup>2</sup> reflective panels made from an unidentified material<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup>. When observed from outside, the building's floorplan is elliptical and covers an area of 3900\u00a0m<sup>2</sup>.</p>\n<p>The internal structure changes at irregular intervals, altering the position of corridors or the furniture of rooms. To the best of our knowledge, the foyer, used as a waiting area, is exempt from these changes. It is assumed that the workforce either determines or is informed about these changes in advance. Space also appears to be distorted inside the anomaly. According to information provided by the hospital, all floors connect together on the same level, making elevators and stairs unnecessary, and it also appears that the internal floorplan is rectangular.</p>\n<p>According to their own records, the hospital staff consists of 50 doctors, with a Dr Kat\u014d serving as chief physician, as well as 100 nurses and 20 staff described as \"specialists\".</p>\n<p>As noted above, the building itself is located in the Freeport of Sjhlfels am Rhein, but it can be accessed through several other entrances in the form of Ways, only some of which are known to the Foundation. Whenever anyone steps into one of these Ways, they are transported into the foyer of the anomaly. Whenever anyone exits the anomaly, they are transported back to their location of entry.</p>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">List\u00a0of\u00a0known\u00a0entrances.\u00a0Requires\u00a0Level\u00a04\u00a0Security\u00a0Clearance\u00a0to\u00a0access</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Security\u00a0Clearance\u00a0recognised.\u00a0Click\u00a0here\u00a0to\u00a0close.</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<td><strong>~Entrance</strong></td>\n<td><strong>~Location</strong></td>\n<td><strong>~Appearance</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SCP-208-DE-1</td>\n<td>Vienna International Centre, Vienna</td>\n<td>Unknown, but located within the GOC buildings.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SCP-208-DE-2</td>\n<td>Avenue 4.3, Eurtec</td>\n<td>Large white facade emblazoned with the insignia of the Red Cross and the World Parahealth Organisation.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SCP-208-DE-3</td>\n<td>Charit\u00e9, Berlin</td>\n<td>Through a pretermemetically<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-4\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')\">4</a></sup> protected \"cellar door\".</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Appendix 1:</strong> It is presumed that the GOC is using SCP-208-DE to observe the Freeport of Sjhlfels am Rhein.

Let's just ask.</p>\n<p><em>The two agents go over to one of the counters at the other side of the room and approach the woman sitting there.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Wildenhain:</strong> Good Day, my name is Wildenhain, this is my college M\u00f6llehof. We're agents of the SCP Foundation. Could you answer a few questions, Ms\u2026?</p>\n<p><strong>Fink:</strong> Fink. And no, I can't, I don't have either the authorisation or the time to answer your questions. As you can see, people are lining up here.</p>\n<p><strong>M\u00f6llehof:</strong> What for?</p>\n<p><strong>Fink:</strong> I believe that Dr. Kat\u014d can best explain this to you. Ah! He's already coming over.</p>\n<p><em>Ms Fink points with her hand towards a door, through which a middle-aged man enters.

I guess you had to show up at some point.</p>\n<p><em>Dr. Kat\u014d walks past the agents and passes through another door.

And that's what it is.</p>\n<p><em>Dr. Kat\u014d leads the Agents into a long corridor, with windows through which the harbor is visible.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Wildenhain:</strong> I can understand why the WPHO would build a hospital. But why here in Sjhlfels?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Kat\u014d:</strong> The answer is obvious: this is neutral ground. We can treat practically anyone here, regardless of which organisation they belong to.</p>\n<p><strong>Wildenhain:</strong> But\u2026 Why? Why would you help people that oppose the GOC?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Kat\u014d:</strong> Medical treatment should be available to anyone, regardless of their position.</p>\n<p><strong>Wildenhain:</strong> But that's totally counterproductive.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Kat\u014d:</strong> Unfortunately, that's true. To be honest, the Council wasn't a fan of building a hospital that would treat parathreats, but since they got here before us we didn't have many other options. At least this way, we can polish up our image. Most people still see us as otherworldly mass-murders.</p>\n<p><strong>Wildenhain:</strong> Are they-</p>\n<p><strong>M\u00f6llehof:</strong> Stay focused. For medical care, you don't need a GOC hospital. I mean, any doctor can treat gunshot-wounds.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Kat\u014d:</strong> Gunshot-wounds? This clinic was not build for gunshot wounds. Sure, we do handle normal ailments, but but our main focus has always been the treatment of paranormal diseases.</p>\n<p><strong>M\u00f6llehof:</strong> Hardly anyone gets sick from those. Especially not in a town like Sjhlfels.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Kat\u014d:</strong> On the contrary, many people contract them, especially members of anomalous communities. There are other entrances to this pocket dimension outside of Sjhlfels.</p>\n<p><strong>Wildenhain:</strong> And where from, may I ask?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Kat\u014d:</strong> For that, I'll have to ask the Council first.

Since he was unable to bring any recording equipment with him, the sequence of events was determined based on his recollections during this interview.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>\n<p><strong>Angst:</strong> Good Morning, Mr Wildenhain.</p>\n<p><strong>Wildenhain:</strong> Morning, Mr Angst.</p>\n<p><strong>Angst:</strong> So, let's begin. Please describe simply the course of your stay in SCP-208-DE.</p>\n<p><strong>Wildenhain:</strong> Well, um\u2026 I entered, went over to the counter, and said that I would like to be examined. The woman then gave me a form<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-8\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')\">8</a></sup> to fill out.</p>\n<p><strong>Angst:</strong> What kind of form?</p>\n<p><strong>Wildenhain:</strong> Simply a piece of paper, where I had to write down my details and so on. Age, sex, that sort of thing. A couple of questions were a little unusual, but what else would you expect?</p>\n<p><strong>Angst:</strong> Please go on.</p>\n<p><strong>Wildenhain:</strong> After I'd filled it out, I went back to her and was told I was supposed to sit on one of the benches.</p>\n<p><strong>Angst:</strong> And then?</p>\n<p><strong>Wildenhain:</strong> Well, I sat down and waited until my turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Angst:</strong> How long did that take?</p>\n<p><strong>Wildenhain:</strong> Approximately fifteen minutes. The clock was pretty far away, so I didn't get a good look.</p>\n<p><strong>Angst:</strong> And then?</p>\n<p><strong>Wildenhain:</strong> This Dr. Kat\u014d greeted me and lead me into a treatment room.</p>\n<p><strong>Angst:</strong> What did this room look like?</p>\n<p><strong>Wildenhain:</strong> Just like a normal treatment room in a normal hospital.</p>\n<p><strong>Angst:</strong> Anyway, what happened then?</p>\n<p><strong>Wildenhain:</strong> He then asked me how I was doing, and whether I had any complaints.</p>\n<p><strong>Angst:</strong> And? Did you?</p>\n<p><strong>Wildenhain:</strong> Yeah, nothing special, only a pain in my back, from the time this bastard of a poltergeist hit me with a table<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-9\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-9')\">9</a></sup>.</p>\n<p><strong>Angst:</strong> Did you tell that to Dr. Kat\u014d?</p>\n<p><strong>Wildenhain:</strong> Yes. He said that he'd take a closer look later, and first go through some routine tests.</p>\n<p><strong>Angst:</strong> And what did these tests involve?</p>\n<p><strong>Wildenhain:</strong> First, he gave me some kind of VR-glasses to put on, and they displayed a few fractals.</p>\n<p><strong>Angst:</strong> Did you ask him what the purpose of that was?</p>\n<p><strong>Wildenhain:</strong> I did. It was supposed to measure my brain activity and see how I react to memes.</p>\n<p><strong>Angst:</strong> Was that all?</p>\n<p><strong>Wildenhain:</strong> No\u2026 He said he'd move on to the next step. He brought me into another room, but that definitely wasn't a treatment room.</p>\n<p><strong>Angst:</strong> Rather?</p>\n<p><strong>Wildenhain:</strong> It was more like a photography studio. I had to stand in front of a metal wall, with my legs apart and my arms outstretched, while I was filmed by multiple cameras. Meanwhile, Dr. Kat\u014d was watching various screens with a woman, I think her name was Dr. Maur.</p>\n<p><strong>Angst:</strong> And what was that for?</p>\n<p><strong>Wildenhain:</strong> I asked him that as well. Apparently they were metaphysical scanners. For EVE, and such like.</p>\n<p><strong>Angst:</strong> And?</p>\n<p><strong>Wildenhain:</strong> They told me that everything was in order so far, but that spectral energy was accumulating in my back, at the point where it hurt.</p>\n<p><strong>Angst:</strong> Were they able to treat you?</p>\n<p><strong>Wildenhain:</strong> <em>(nods)</em> I was brought into another room. This one also looked like a normal treatment room. I was told to take off my shirt and lie face down on a couch. Dr. Kat\u014d then placed a metal cylinder on the spot, and the surface of it heated up.

Due to the immense benefit it provides, there are also no plans to infiltrate the facility, although known entrances to SCP-208-DE are being monitored for the appearance of any Persons of Interest. If authorised by an O4 Council Member, Foundation Personnel can receive treatment at SCP-208-DE.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-208-DE is the St. Caesarius [[footnote]] Presumably named after the Christian Saint Caesarius of Nazianzus, the patron saint of doctors.[[/footnote]] Hospital. In contrast to regular clinics, the main focus of SCP-208-DE is the treatment of anomalous diseases, and the provision of care to members of the paranormal community. The operator of the facility appears to be the World Parahealth Organisation (WPHO), one of the member organisations of the GOC. Care costs between 200 and 5000 Euros, but is qualitatively above the German standard and available to anyone. This includes members of organisations hostile to the GOC, including members of the Church of the Broken God, the Syndicate[[footnote]] German paracriminal Group of Interest. [[/footnote]] and even the Serpent's Hand. This neutrality stems from the anomaly's location within the [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/nexus-series#sjhlfels| Sjhlfel am Rhein Nexus]]].\n\n\n\nThe building's 35 meter high facade is assembled from 1.5 m^^2^^ reflective panels made from an unidentified material[[footnote]]Windows have been observed while inside SCP-208-DE, but none are visible from outside.[[/footnote]]. When observed from outside, the building's floorplan is elliptical and covers an area of 3900 m^^2^^.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe internal structure changes at irregular intervals, altering the position of corridors or the furniture of rooms. To the best of our knowledge, the foyer, used as a waiting area, is exempt from these changes. It is assumed that the workforce either determines or is informed about these changes in advance. Space also appears to be distorted inside the anomaly. According to information provided by the hospital, all floors connect together on the same level, making elevators and stairs unnecessary, and it also appears that the internal floorplan is rectangular.\n\n\n\nAccording to their own records, the hospital staff consists of 50 doctors, with a Dr Kat\u014d serving as chief physician, as well as 100 nurses and 20 staff described as \"specialists\".\n\n\n\nAs noted above, the building itself is located in the Freeport of Sjhlfels am Rhein, but it can be accessed through several other entrances in the form of Ways, only some of which are known to the Foundation. Whenever anyone steps into one of these Ways, they are transported into the foyer of the anomaly. Whenever anyone exits the anomaly, they are transported back to their location of entry.\n\n\n\n----\n\n[[collapsible show=\"List of known entrances.

Proof of this theory has not yet been found.\n\n\n\n**Appendix 2:** The inhabitants of the Freeport often express negative opinions regarding the architecture of SCP-208-DE. The GOC made an official statement, asserting that \"due to the immense cost of renovation, the building would not be altered.\"\n\n\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-208-DE was built on 30/06/200\u2588 with the assistance of Thaumaturgy and paratechnology from Eurtec[[footnote]] A pocket dimension established by members of the GOC in the mid-1970s, as a place for manufacturers of paratechnology to freely develop and sell their \"products\". [[/footnote]] and was inaugurated on 01/07 that same year. Due to having only a small presence in Sjhlfels am Rhein at the time, the Foundation first found out about it five days later.\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Exploration Log 208-DE \" hide=\"Close\"]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n\n**EXPLORATION LOG 208-DE**\n\n\n\n**Date:** 07.07.200\u2588\n\n\n\n**Participants:** Agent Wildenhain and Agent M\u00f6llehof from Outpost-DE20\n\n\n\n**Location:** SCP-208-DE, Sjhlfels am Rhein\n\n\n\n**Foreford:** The two agents were instructed to enter the object through its main entrance in Sjhlfels am Rhein. It should be noted that it was assumed at this point that this was not an actual hospital, and that this appearance merely served to conceal its true purpose.\n\n-----\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n\n**Wildenhain:** Okay, ready?\n\n\n\n**M\u00f6llehof:** Yes.\n\n\n\n//The Agents enter SCP-208-DE. They find themselves inside a kind of foyer. People are sitting on benches along the walls, apparently waiting for something.//\n\n\n\n**M\u00f6llehof:** It looks like some kind of Hospital...\n\n\n\n**Wildenhain:** Well, there is a big sign hanging outside saying \"St. Caesarius Clinic\"...\n\n\n\n**M\u00f6llehof:** Yes, yes... wait an minute - that's the WPHO logo over there. What are the Gocks doing in Sjhlfels?\n\n\n\n**Wildenhain:** How should I know? Let's just ask.\n\n\n\n//The two agents go over to one of the counters at the other side of the room and approach the woman sitting there.//\n\n\n\n**Wildenhain:** Good Day, my name is Wildenhain, this is my college M\u00f6llehof. We're agents of the SCP Foundation. Could you answer a few questions, Ms...?\n\n\n\n**Fink:** Fink. And no, I can't, I don't have either the authorisation or the time to answer your questions. As you can see, people are lining up here.\n\n\n\n**M\u00f6llehof:** What for?\n\n\n\n**Fink:** I believe that Dr. Kat\u014d can best explain this to you. Ah! He's already coming over.\n\n\n\n//Ms Fink points with her hand towards a door, through which a middle-aged man enters. Based on his attire, he appears to be a doctor.//\n\n\n\n//The agents approach Dr. Kat\u014d and show him their IDs.//\n\n\n\n**Dr. Kat\u014d:** Foundation? I guess you had to show up at some point.\n\n\n\n//Dr. Kat\u014d walks past the agents and passes through another door. The agents follow him.//\n\n\n\n**Dr. Kat\u014d:** Please be brief, I have a thaumic transfer to perform.\n\n\n\n**M\u00f6llehof:** A wh-\n\n\n\n**Wildenhain:** Then lets start with the most obvious question: what is this?\n\n\n\n**Dr. Kat\u014d:** What does it look like?\n\n\n\n**M\u00f6llehof:** A hospital.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Kat\u014d:** Exactly. And that's what it is.\n\n\n\n//Dr. Kat\u014d leads the Agents into a long corridor, with windows through which the harbor is visible.//\n\n\n\n**Wildenhain:** I can understand why the WPHO would build a hospital. But why here in Sjhlfels?\n\n\n\n**Dr. Kat\u014d:** The answer is obvious: this is neutral ground. We can treat practically anyone here, regardless of which organisation they belong to.\n\n\n\n**Wildenhain:** But... Why? Why would you help people that oppose the GOC?\n\n\n\n**Dr. Kat\u014d:** Medical treatment should be available to anyone, regardless of their position.\n\n\n\n**Wildenhain:** But that's totally counterproductive.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Kat\u014d:** Unfortunately, that's true. To be honest, the Council wasn't a fan of building a hospital that would treat parathreats, but since they got here before us we didn't have many other options. At least this way, we can polish up our image. Most people still see us as otherworldly mass-murders.\n\n\n\n**Wildenhain:** Are they-\n\n\n\n**M\u00f6llehof:** Stay focused. For medical care, you don't need a GOC hospital. I mean, any doctor can treat gunshot-wounds.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Kat\u014d:** Gunshot-wounds? This clinic was not build for gunshot wounds. Sure, we do handle normal ailments, but but our main focus has always been the treatment of paranormal diseases.\n\n\n\n**M\u00f6llehof:** Hardly anyone gets sick from those. Especially not in a town like Sjhlfels.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Kat\u014d:** On the contrary, many people contract them, especially members of anomalous communities. There are other entrances to this pocket dimension outside of Sjhlfels.\n\n\n\n**Wildenhain:** And where from, may I ask?\n\n\n\n**Dr. Kat\u014d:** For that, I'll have to ask the Council first. I'll send you an email later[[footnote]] A short list of presumed locations was actually sent. However, most of them are inaccessible to the Foundation.[[/footnote]].\n\n\n\n**M\u00f6llehof:** Um... Thank you...\n\n\n\n**Wildenhain:** So, what are you dealing with currently?\n\n\n\n**Dr. Kat\u014d:** Memetic pathogens, curses, metaphysical parasites, extraterrestrial viruses. Just to give a few examples.\n\n\n\n//Dr. Kat\u014d reaches the end of the corridor and opens to he door with the help of an key card.//\n\n\n\n**Dr. Kat\u014d:** Only personnel and patients are allowed through here. Have a nice day. Oh, and before I forget: naturally, we'll also treat agents of the Foundation.

Since he was unable to bring any recording equipment with him, the sequence of events was determined based on his recollections during this interview.\n\n----\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n\n**Angst:** Good Morning, Mr Wildenhain.\n\n\n\n**Wildenhain:** Morning, Mr Angst.\n\n\n\n**Angst:** So, let's begin. Please describe simply the course of your stay in SCP-208-DE.\n\n\n\n**Wildenhain:** Well, um... I entered, went over to the counter, and said that I would like to be examined. The woman then gave me a form[[footnote]] See \"Reconstructed Form\" [[/footnote]] to fill out.\n\n\n\n**Angst:** What kind of form?\n\n\n\n**Wildenhain:** Simply a piece of paper, where I had to write down my details and so on. Age, sex, that sort of thing. A couple of questions were a little unusual, but what else would you expect?\n\n\n\n**Angst:** Please go on.\n\n\n\n**Wildenhain:** After I'd filled it out, I went back to her and was told I was supposed to sit on one of the benches.\n\n\n\n**Angst:** And then?\n\n\n\n**Wildenhain:** Well, I sat down and waited until my turn.\n\n\n\n**Angst:** How long did that take?\n\n\n\n**Wildenhain:** Approximately fifteen minutes. The clock was pretty far away, so I didn't get a good look.\n\n\n\n**Angst:** And then?\n\n\n\n**Wildenhain:** This Dr. Kat\u014d greeted me and lead me into a treatment room.\n\n\n\n**Angst:** What did this room look like?\n\n\n\n**Wildenhain:** Just like a normal treatment room in a normal hospital.\n\n\n\n**Angst:** Anyway, what happened then?\n\n\n\n**Wildenhain:** He then asked me how I was doing, and whether I had any complaints.\n\n\n\n**Angst:** And? Did you?\n\n\n\n**Wildenhain:** Yeah, nothing special, only a pain in my back, from the time this bastard of a poltergeist hit me with a table [[footnote]] Agent Wildenhain was previously a member of a Reactionary Task Force (RTF) stationed at Site-DE20. During an attack by PoI-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-DE, he sustained a minor injury and has subsequently suffered from phantom pains. [[/footnote]].\n\n\n\n**Angst:** Did you tell that to Dr. Kat\u014d?\n\n\n\n**Wildenhain:** Yes. He said that he'd take a closer look later, and first go through some routine tests.\n\n\n\n**Angst:** And what did these tests involve?\n\n\n\n**Wildenhain:** First, he gave me some kind of VR-glasses to put on, and they displayed a few fractals.\n\n\n\n**Angst:** Did you ask him what the purpose of that was?\n\n\n\n**Wildenhain:** I did. It was supposed to measure my brain activity and see how I react to memes.\n\n\n\n**Angst:** Was that all?\n\n\n\n**Wildenhain:** No... He said he'd move on to the next step. He brought me into another room, but that definitely wasn't a treatment room.\n\n\n\n**Angst:** Rather?\n\n\n\n**Wildenhain:** It was more like a photography studio. I had to stand in front of a metal wall, with my legs apart and my arms outstretched, while I was filmed by multiple cameras. Meanwhile, Dr. Kat\u014d was watching various screens with a woman, I think her name was Dr. Maur.\n\n\n\n**Angst:** And what was that for?\n\n\n\n**Wildenhain:** I asked him that as well. Apparently they were metaphysical scanners. For EVE, and such like.\n\n\n\n**Angst:** And?\n\n\n\n**Wildenhain:** They told me that everything was in order so far, but that spectral energy was accumulating in my back, at the point where it hurt.\n\n\n\n**Angst:** Were they able to treat you?\n\n\n\n**Wildenhain:** //(nods)// I was brought into another room. This one also looked like a normal treatment room. I was told to take off my shirt and lie face down on a couch. Dr. Kat\u014d then placed a metal cylinder on the spot, and the surface of it heated up. After a minute, I could stand up again and put my shirt back on.\n\n\n\n**Angst:** And then you could leave?\n\n\n\n**Wildenhain:** Affirmative.\n\n\n\n**Angst:** Then, that's all for now. The interview is over. Have a good day.\n\n\n\n**Wildenhain:** You too.\n\n-----\n\n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n----\n\n**Notes:** The following morning, a bill of 2000 Euros was sent to Outpost-DE20.

Well, no: St. Caesarius really does exist.\n\n\n\nI know the thought of the Global Occult Coalition running a hospital is ridiculous. And I can tell you that the Coalition itself is not a big fan of providing medical care to people it otherwise persecutes. But think about this: SCP-208-DE was not built out of compassion or caring. It's no accident that the whole thing was initially assumed to be an elaborate facade for a surveillance operation.\n\n\n\nThe Coalition receives precise medical data on their \"patients\", as well as their current location. Have you ever thought about that? We know of at least two well documented cases, in which individuals were shadowed by GOC agents after receiving treatment, and were terminated after leaving Sjhlfels. Those were probably not isolated cases.\n\n\n\nThat is why we only see low-level PoIs inside SCP-208-DE.

Adults approaching an entrance do not cause it to activate.</p>\n<p>SCP-2104-A is able to alter reality inside SCP-2104-B to a certain extent, changing the composition of matter and considerably affecting the behavior of indigenous fauna and flora of the area. During the last 50 years, SCP-2104-A has modified SCP-2104-B to reflect a series of themes from Aesop\u2019s fables, along other unidentified manifestations. Some animals within the area have shown the ability to speak, and commonly refer to SCP-2104-A as \"the king by the tree.\"</p>\n<p>According to the results of field analysis, SCP-2104-B is geographically identical to the area it covers in this reality construct.</p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">+\u00a0Excerpt\u00a0from\u00a0Reconnaissance\u00a0Report\u00a02104-5</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">-\u00a0Close</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Excerpt from Reconnaissance Report 2104-5, \u2588/\u2588/97</strong></p>\n<p><em>Subject-5 (male, 9 years old), equipped with a helmet with an integrated video camera, accesses SCP-2104-B through Entrance 7.</em></p>\n<p><em>Recording begins.

The fence's perimeter is to be patrolled\u00a0\u00a0to avoid civilian intruders. Any civilian crossing the perimeter must be administered Class B amnestics.\n\n\n\nObservation Post-04 has been created near the village of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Spain, to remotely monitor the 32 known entries to SCP-2104-B.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-2104-A is a humanoid entity of variable appearance. SCP-2104-A is located inside SCP-2104-B, and seems to be unable to leave this area or act outside it.(See Addendum 004/1.)\n\n\n\nSCP-2104-A is able to partially control its physical appearance, and usually takes the form of a child\u00a0\u00a0between 7 and 9 years old. Based on previous interactions recorded during reconnaissance missions, SCP-2104-A presents symptoms of\u00a0\u00a0intellectual disability. Its body is covered by different kinds of organic materials (such as fur, sticks, and mud) and small living organisms, including birds, insects, rodents, and lichens.\n\n\n\nSCP-2104-A displays a positive emotional response to interaction with children, but shows fear when approached by adults. \n\n\n\nSCP-2104-A is typically found in the same location, under a holm oak tree //(Quercus ilex)// with a weathered straw rope\u00a0\u00a0hanging from one of the tree's branches. \n\n\n\nSCP-2104-B is an extra-dimensional space\u00a0\u00a0that occupies an approximate geographic surface of 0.15 km^^2^^. To date, 32 entries to SCP-2104-B have been identified and documented. Entrances are always centered on natural terrain features such as rocks or trees, and are effectively invisible to the naked eye.\n\n\n\nEntrances to SCP-2104-B are normally inactive, but will activate if approached by prepubescent children. Adults approaching an entrance do not cause it to activate.\n\n\n\nSCP-2104-A is able to alter reality inside SCP-2104-B to a certain extent, changing the composition of matter and considerably affecting the behavior of indigenous fauna and flora of the area. During the last 50 years, SCP-2104-A has modified SCP-2104-B to reflect a series of themes from Aesop\u2019s fables, along other unidentified manifestations.\u00a0\u00a0Some animals within the area have shown the ability to speak, and commonly refer to SCP-2104-A as \"the king by the tree.\"\n\n\n\nAccording to the results of field analysis, SCP-2104-B is geographically identical to the area it covers in this reality construct.\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Excerpt from Reconnaissance Report 2104-5\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n\n> **Excerpt from Reconnaissance Report 2104-5, \u2588/\u2588/97**\n\n> \n\n> //Subject-5 (male, 9 years old), equipped with a helmet with an integrated video camera, accesses SCP-2104-B through Entrance 7.//\n\n> \n\n> //Recording begins.

There is a large platter filled with vines of grapes. SCP-2104-A displays the appearance of a 7-10 year old child, dressed in what appear to be vine leaves. Upon seeing the subject, both entities address him.//\n\n> \n\n> **Fox:** You came! We were awaiting for an illustrious guest, and my king was feeling hungry.\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-2104-A:** H-hello, friend!\n\n> \n\n> //SCP-2104-A watches the subject with expectation and points to a seat. The subject is instructed to take it and behave naturally. The fox approaches the subject with a bundle of grapes.//\n\n> \n\n> **Subject-5:** But... but I don't like grapes.\n\n> \n\n> **Fox:** Hey! These grapes are ripe and ready to eat!\n\n> \n\n> //The fox growls threateningly at the subject. SCP-2104-A appears nervous, and intervenes.//\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-2104-A:** Go away! Bad fox!\n\n> \n\n> //SCP-2104-A then proceeds then to gather pebbles and mud from the ground around the table, and places them into an empty dish. Afterwards, he offers the dish to the subject in a friendly manner.//\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-2104-A:** T-tasty meatballs and mashed pot-tatoes.\n\n> \n\n> //The pebbles and mud are replaced by meatballs and mashed potatoes.//\n\n> \n\n> //The subject is given further instructions to leave the area.

SCP-2195 includes biological samples preserved through various methods, demonstration and test articles, prototypes, and a variety of documents. The sum of documentation recovered was enough to fill 19 (nineteen) shipping containers at the moment of discovery.</p>\n<p>Analysis of said evidence has shown that the project took place in political, historical and socio-cultural circumstances inconsistent with known reality, which suggests extradimensional or otherwise anomalous origin.</p>\n<p>Although no fully formed SCP-2195-1 were discovered within SCP-2195, recovered materials provide enough information to give a complete description of their appearance. SCP-2195-1 are living, genetically altered human infants of indeterminate sex (SCP-2195-1 allosomes are identical, and contain genetic information from both X and Y chromosomes).</p>\n<p>SCP-2195-1 body structure is radically different from that of normal infants; SCP-2195-1 are presumed to have the shape of an ellipsoid roughly 60\u00a0cm long and 50\u00a0cm in circumference, and mass of 9 to 9.5\u00a0kg. The physiology of tissues covering the front and back ends is identical to that of somewhat calloused human skin; the rest of the skin is sphacelated, metamorphised, parchment-like and fused with the underlying bone (no muscles and/or fat tissues are present). Ribs grow away from the whole length of the spine (55 to 56 pairs of ribs in total); the ribs are flattened and fused along their whole length, which creates a solid bone capsule with the pelvis and the skull fused immovably to its respective ends.</p>\n<p>The skull is small, streamlined forwards and has radial symmetry. The only orifice facing outside is a large eye socket on the front end of the body, which contains an anatomically normal eye with a transparent protective membrane. No auditory apparatus is present, but the inner ear vestibular system is extremely developed.</p>\n<p>The pelvic section also has radial symmetry and serves as an attachment point for four identical limbs facing upwards and downwards diagonally. These limbs are around 10 centimeters long and contain a single pointed bone, which is connected to the pelvis by a ball-and-socket joint, resembling the human hip joint or shoulder joint. Their freedom of movement is severely restricted by the joint's position within the body, as well as rigid tendons; nonetheless they are fitted with powerful muscles intended to turn the limb around its axis. An orifice with a sphincter is located between these limbs, which leads to a small dead-end cavity with richly innervated walls.</p>\n<p>Inner organs are mostly either rudimentary or missing, which makes SCP-2195-1's life expectancy to be 10 to 15 minutes, unless sustained by an external life support system. Apart from the aforementioned sensory organs, central nervous system and muscles, only the circulatory system is developed, which includes major vessels, the heart and an organ that resembles a radically altered spleen; said organ has thick, myoglobin-rich walls that can accumulate a certain amount of oxygen and release it into the blood, and filters carbon dioxide out of the blood. There is also a small cluster of electrocytes, which is connected via nerves to the cardiac conducting system.</p>\n<p>Aside from the front and back ends, the majority of SCP-2195-1 body is occupied by tissue that structurally resembles liver tissue with extreme adipose degeneration (vacuoles amount for 97% of its volume and even more than that in mass); instead of fat, the vacuoles contain a complex organic substance that has pronounced explosive properties.</p>\n<p>Its exact parameters cannot be determined due to the irregularity of the remaining biological components' amount within tissues, as well as due to the the substance's own nature (supposedly, a mix of several compounds with similar properties in varying proportions). Approximate properties can be described as such:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Density: 1.8-1.9\u00a0g/cm<sup>3</sup></li>\n<li>Specific energy of explosion: 9.2\u00a0MJ/kg</li>\n<li>Explosive strength (measured by Trauzl test): 670\u00a0cm<sup>3</sup></li>\n<li>Brisance (measured by Kast test): 8\u00a0mm</li>\n<li>Detonation velocity: 8300-8500\u00a0m/s</li>\n<li>Sensitivity: 70% explosions with a 10\u00a0kg weight dropped from a height of 25\u00a0cm.</li>\n<li>Amount of tissue in an instance of SCP-2195-1: 7.5 to 8\u00a0kg, explosive yield up to 25\u00a0kg of TNT equivalent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>According to the documents, SCP-2195-1 have a gestation time of 40 weeks which is normal to humans. They were also naturally born, but subject to the following operative treatment immediately after birth:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>catheterization of 2 major vessels for connection to life support system;</li>\n<li>installation of a metal clamp along the spine which acts as a band for a suspension mount;</li>\n<li>mounting of reinforced plastic fins on the limbs;</li>\n<li>fitting the front end with a transparent nose cone.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After that SCP-2195-1 were subject to three-week training in a wind tunnel fitted with elastic suspension systems and an image projector to display various battlefield scenes as seen from above. For that purpose, a device for electrical nerve stimulation was inserted into the orifice at the rear end of SCP-2195-1; the higher the achieved targeting precision, the greater the stimulation. The SCP-2195-1 specimens were thus trained to develop visual recognition skills for various targets, and trained to control their flight using limb-mounted aerofoil planes. During the training, the electric organ, which functions as a detonator, was to be temporarily disabled by means of paralytic agent injections.</p>\n<p>Following the training SCP-2195-1 was to be tattooed with an emblem of the target it was trained for, put into a state of suspended animation and packed into a shipping container for later use as a homing high explosive bomb.</p>\n<p>The documentation found as part of SCP-2195 is mostly typewritten in a language having minute differences with modern French, although the origin of names and toponyms mentioned within seems to be more English. No similarities with modern geography were found. The name of the state is never mentioned; instead, \u00abNotre Patrie\u00bb (\u00abOur Fatherland\u00bb) is listed even in official office, position and department names, which is often abbreviated to NP (e.g., \u00abPr\u00e9sident de NP\u00bb).</p>\n<p>According to the information contained within, the state waged a long and slaughterous offensive war on another state's territory, which was not popular among its populace. State propaganda efforts were not sufficient to subdue the growing pacifist movement which was especially strong among the soldiers' mothers. The arms industry was also on the verge of decline. The documented project was proposed in order to solve both problems, and was meant to implant embryos of SCP-2195-1 into all fertile women under the guise of various mandatory medical procedures. The surge of \"living bombs\" born afterwards was announced as a natural event, a manifestation of mass consciousness, the will of the people, and an evidence of charitability<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> of the military intervention taking place. Another important factor was the mother's blood relationship which required a mother to unconditionally support her child's \"voluntary effort\", which in turn demanded her to abolish any pacifist beliefs and/or made her an indirect participant of the bombings, with personal responsibility forced on her later on.</p>\n<p><em>Note: this shows drastic differences of ethical norms between our society and the one described. It is hard to imagine that measures like these would have any effect in any state we know, yet SCP-2195 documents describe them as extremely effective yet highly immoral, although only in the sense that both the higher will and the blood relationship were falsified, therefore the highest values were fraudulently exploited.</em></p>\n<p>However, various events that took place during the project's development, should they have become public, would have brought sharp discredit on it, due to both their negative nature, and the fact that the nature and sheer amount of these events contradicted the idea of higher force's mercy and justice, therefore making the \"higher will\" explanation unviable.</p>\n<p>First and foremost, SCP-2195 contains evidence of numerous complicating disorders during pregnancy and birth:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Various fetal pathologies and deformities, miscarriages, cases of stillbirth. Preserved samples included.</li>\n<li>Numerous cases of ectopic pregnancy. Several postmortem specimens and a variety of medical records are available. Vast majority of these cases resulted in the mother's death or loss of fertility, which was grounds for euthanasia.</li>\n<li>Birth trauma and cases of mothers' deaths at birth due to the fetus' size and rigid structure. Medical records available.</li>\n<li>Acute, often life-threatening toxicoses caused by metabolic byproducts during explosive substance formation inside fetus. Several in-depth research papers, histological samples and body fluid samples available.</li>\n<li>Anemia, dangerous exhaustion of the mother's body due to the fetus' accelerated growth. An essay of observations concerning this issue is available.</li>\n<li>Multifetal gestation which almost inevitably caused pathologies. Cases of SCP-2195-1 conjoined twins. A range of medical records available. The majority of such pregnancies were aborted due to critical situations; preserved fetus samples available.</li>\n<li>Hyperplasia, fermental chorionic hyperactivity, or detrimental chorion deformation leading to formation of multiple large synechiated folds. Hyperactivity, abnormal growth or improper position of the resulting placenta caused destruction of uterine walls, mouth of the womb, or fallopian tubes. Preserved samples, extensive studies and medical records available. Numerous descriptions of deaths due to internal bleeding and cases of euthanasia due to loss of fertility after operative treatment are also available.</li>\n<li>Spontaneous fetus detonations on latter stages of pregnancy. Investigation reports, autopsy protocols, and an archive of media reports are available. Collateral damage and fatalities are described, with the cause presented by propaganda as \"immoral conduct that is disgracing motherhood\". No details of said conduct were provided, although the manner this description is used in suggests that it is a common euphemism for some specific deeds.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another class of materials regards the project's social consequences. It is composed mostly of the following media archives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cases of pregnant women committing suicide. The reason was most often declared as strong pacifistic beliefs. A shot to the belly was specifically popular, which often caused SCP-2195-1 to detonate. A series of suicides was committed in public for demonstration purposes, some cases were essentially acts of terrorism in popular places, which led to fatalities. One such act was committed in a maternity welfare center which caused a chain reaction and large-scale destruction.</li>\n<li>Several attempts of fertile women to dodge medical supervision, have an independent birth and nurture SCP-2195-1 on their own, always futile due to the latter's inviability.</li>\n<li>An incident with a high-ranking government official, who was also part of the project, attempting to make compromising information related to the project public during a speech. The speech was interrupted, and the official in question arrested, declared incurably mentally ill, and subsequently euthanized.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Note: it should be noted that no cases of an illegal abortion were described.</em></p>\n<p>A third class of documents is composed of scientific and design documents related to the project's development and implementation. These materials' level of classification is related to three basic facts: the need to conceal SCP-2195-1 true origins in order to support the propaganda, contradiction with conventional ethics and the current law that makes cloning, genetic engineering and similar activities illegal, as well as to the wide use of SCP-2195-1 samples for tests and experiments. A large part of these documents is encrypted, their contents are currently unknown. The materials available for study include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prototypes and early samples of SCP-2195-1.</li>\n<li>Presentation materials prepared for acceptance inspection hearings, instructional materials and demonstration samples, visual aids, and mock-ups. Both artificial products and real SCP-2195-1 samples preserved through plastic infusion or stored in synthetic resin blocks.</li>\n<li>Modified SCP-2195-1 prototypes and related documents for a project aiming to make homing artillery shells by converting SCP-2195-1. The attempt failed, no instances of SCP-2195-1 that could withstand the acceleration at the moment of the shot could be created.</li>\n<li>Prototypes and documentation for another attempt to modify SCP-2195-1. They were supposed to be fitted with a rocket engine and used as homing missiles. Tests were successful, but the modification was declared unpractical for economic reasons, as cheap SCP-2195-1 were to be fitted with factory-made components.</li>\n<li>Government decree to recall and collect or destroy all compromising evidence. The document mentions some event that aggravated the situation around the project and compromised its secrecy; this could have been the aforementioned public speech. It is assumed that the whole of SCP-2195 was composed as fulfillment of said decree.</li>\n<li>An index of all collected materials. Only codes are listed instead of titles for encrypted documents, along with a reference to the document with these codes' breakdown (also encrypted).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>During my time in the Foundation's employ I've seen worse, but I'd still like to believe that there never was a place where things like these are made on a national scale, and this object is only a miscarriage of some alternate history branch or a material manifestation of some perverted fantasy.

The Foundation took over and investigated the cargo's origins. Its movements could be traced up to 1995; it was found that since 1995 the cargo was constantly moving across Russia by railroad and sea in a loop route. The transfers were paid for from an account established by an unidentified person in 1993 or earlier; no further information could be gathered due to loss of related documents.</p>\n<p>Investigations about the cargo escaping any inspections or searches, save for weight checks, is underway. According to weight checks information, the cargo remained untampered during the whole period; undamaged seals on container doors confirm that. This still does not explain how the cryonic tanks for storing biological samples were discovered 60% or more full despite requiring a coolant refill once every 6 months.</p>\n<p>Several hypotheses were proposed to explain this fact and the object's origin as a whole, but at the moment, there is a lack of evidence for any of them.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 2</strong></p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">+\u00a0Classified\u00a0-\u00a0level\u00a04\u00a0access\u00a0only</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">-\u00a0Level\u00a04\u00a0access\u00a0confirmed</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>After several attempts Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's research group successfully recreated a specimen of SCP-2195-1 using genetic material from SCP-2195 and D-39207 as a surrogate mother.

Another important factor was the mother's blood relationship which required a mother to unconditionally support her child's \"voluntary effort\", which in turn demanded her to abolish any pacifist beliefs and/or made her an indirect participant of the bombings, with personal responsibility forced on her later on.\n\n\n\n//Note: this shows drastic differences of ethical norms between our society and the one described. It is hard to imagine that measures like these would have any effect in any state we know, yet SCP-2195 documents describe them as extremely effective yet highly immoral, although only in the sense that both the higher will and the blood relationship were falsified, therefore the highest values were fraudulently exploited.//\n\n\n\nHowever, various events that took place during the project's development, should they have become public, would have brought sharp discredit on it, due to both their negative nature, and the fact that the nature and sheer amount of these events contradicted the idea of higher force's mercy and justice, therefore making the \"higher will\" explanation unviable.\n\n\n\nFirst and foremost, SCP-2195 contains evidence of numerous complicating disorders during pregnancy and birth:\n\n* Various fetal pathologies and deformities, miscarriages, cases of stillbirth. Preserved samples included.\n\n* Numerous cases of ectopic pregnancy. Several postmortem specimens and a variety of medical records are available. Vast majority of these cases resulted in the mother's death or loss of fertility, which was grounds for euthanasia.\n\n* Birth trauma and cases of mothers' deaths at birth due to the fetus' size and rigid structure. Medical records available.\n\n* Acute, often life-threatening toxicoses caused by metabolic byproducts during explosive substance formation inside fetus. Several in-depth research papers, histological samples and body fluid samples available.\n\n* Anemia, dangerous exhaustion of the mother's body due to the fetus' accelerated growth. An essay of observations concerning this issue is available.\n\n* Multifetal gestation which almost inevitably caused pathologies. Cases of SCP-2195-1 conjoined twins. A range of medical records available. The majority of such pregnancies were aborted due to critical situations; preserved fetus samples available.\n\n* Hyperplasia, fermental chorionic hyperactivity, or detrimental chorion deformation leading to formation of multiple large synechiated folds. Hyperactivity, abnormal growth or improper position of the resulting placenta caused destruction of uterine walls, mouth of the womb, or fallopian tubes. Preserved samples, extensive studies and medical records available. Numerous descriptions of deaths due to internal bleeding and cases of euthanasia due to loss of fertility after operative treatment are also available.\n\n* Spontaneous fetus detonations on latter stages of pregnancy. Investigation reports, autopsy protocols, and an archive of media reports are available. Collateral damage and fatalities are described, with the cause presented by propaganda as \"immoral conduct that is disgracing motherhood\". No details of said conduct were provided, although the manner this description is used in suggests that it is a common euphemism for some specific deeds.\n\n\n\nAnother class of materials regards the project's social consequences. It is composed mostly of the following media archives:\n\n* Cases of pregnant women committing suicide. The reason was most often declared as strong pacifistic beliefs. A shot to the belly was specifically popular, which often caused SCP-2195-1 to detonate. A series of suicides was committed in public for demonstration purposes, some cases were essentially acts of terrorism in popular places, which led to fatalities. One such act was committed in a maternity welfare center which caused a chain reaction and large-scale destruction.\n\n* Several attempts of fertile women to dodge medical supervision, have an independent birth and nurture SCP-2195-1 on their own, always futile due to the latter's inviability.\n\n* An incident with a high-ranking government official, who was also part of the project, attempting to make compromising information related to the project public during a speech. The speech was interrupted, and the official in question arrested, declared incurably mentally ill, and subsequently euthanized.\n\n//Note: it should be noted that no cases of an illegal abortion were described.//\n\n\n\nA third class of documents is composed of scientific and design documents related to the project's development and implementation. These materials' level of classification is related to three basic facts: the need to conceal SCP-2195-1 true origins in order to support the propaganda, contradiction with conventional ethics and the current law that makes cloning, genetic engineering and similar activities illegal, as well as to the wide use of SCP-2195-1 samples for tests and experiments. A large part of these documents is encrypted, their contents are currently unknown. The materials available for study include:\n\n\n\n* Prototypes and early samples of SCP-2195-1.\n\n* Presentation materials prepared for acceptance inspection hearings, instructional materials and demonstration samples, visual aids, and mock-ups. Both artificial products and real SCP-2195-1 samples preserved through plastic infusion or stored in synthetic resin blocks.\n\n* Modified SCP-2195-1 prototypes and related documents for a project aiming to make homing artillery shells by converting SCP-2195-1. The attempt failed, no instances of SCP-2195-1 that could withstand the acceleration at the moment of the shot could be created.\n\n* Prototypes and documentation for another attempt to modify SCP-2195-1. They were supposed to be fitted with a rocket engine and used as homing missiles. Tests were successful, but the modification was declared unpractical for economic reasons, as cheap SCP-2195-1 were to be fitted with factory-made components.\n\n* Government decree to recall and collect or destroy all compromising evidence. The document mentions some event that aggravated the situation around the project and compromised its secrecy; this could have been the aforementioned public speech. It is assumed that the whole of SCP-2195 was composed as fulfillment of said decree.\n\n* An index of all collected materials. Only codes are listed instead of titles for encrypted documents, along with a reference to the document with these codes' breakdown (also encrypted).\n\n\n\n//During my time in the Foundation's employ I've seen worse, but I'd still like to believe that there never was a place where things like these are made on a national scale, and this object is only a miscarriage of some alternate history branch or a material manifestation of some perverted fantasy. I hope to never know the true state of things.// -- Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n**Addendum 1:** Discovery\n\n\n\nSCP-2195, contained in 19 standard shipping containers was initially discovered on \u2588\u2588.\u2588\u2588.2009 by Federal Security Service of Russia operatives during an inspection as part of checking investigative information on weapons smuggling. The Foundation took over and investigated the cargo's origins. Its movements could be traced up to 1995; it was found that since 1995 the cargo was constantly moving across Russia by railroad and sea in a loop route. The transfers were paid for from an account established by an unidentified person in 1993 or earlier; no further information could be gathered due to loss of related documents.\n\n\n\nInvestigations about the cargo escaping any inspections or searches, save for weight checks, is underway. According to weight checks information, the cargo remained untampered during the whole period; undamaged seals on container doors confirm that. This still does not explain how the cryonic tanks for storing biological samples were discovered 60% or more full despite requiring a coolant refill once every 6 months.\n\n\n\nSeveral hypotheses were proposed to explain this fact and the object's origin as a whole, but at the moment, there is a lack of evidence for any of them.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 2**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Classified - level 4 access only\" hide=\"- Level 4 access confirmed\"]]\n\nAfter several attempts Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's research group successfully recreated a specimen of SCP-2195-1 using genetic material from SCP-2195 and D-39207 as a surrogate mother. Despite several complications and the need for a cesarean section delivery, the specimen was fully formed and quite healthy, save for some minute anatomical deviations.\n\n\n\nA series of tests and experiments was conducted, culminating in a successful bombing of a target in the firing range, which completely confirmed the information contained within SCP-2195.\n\n\n\nHowever, the test committee pointed out the immense financial and labor costs to reproduce the sample and its life support system, as well as the sample being generally effective but having no outstanding features, SCP-2195-1 was declared having no practical value to the Foundation.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n<< [[[SCP-2194]]] | SCP-2195 | [[[SCP-2196]]] >>\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>\n\n|author=theTBAPb and Gene R]]\n\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** 1195-1.jpg\n\n> **Name:** Something strange\n\n> **Author:** Mysterious Stranger\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/187534264@N02/49848281113/in/dateposted-public/|Link]]]\n\n=====\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["scp-2194", "scp-2196", "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "licensing-guide", "licensing-master-list"], "scp": "SCP-2195", "scp_number": 2195, "series": "international", "tags": ["_cc", "_licensebox", "_ru", "airborne", "alive", "biological", "humanoid", "international", "safe", "scp"], "title": "SCP-2195", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2195"}, "SCP-227-FR": {"created_at": "2022-05-07T15:06:00", "creator": "Cassandra_Prime", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Cassandra_Prime", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/cassandra-prime", "comment": "Posting translation.

A stock of ancient one (1) franc coins must be available to researchers during testing.</p>\n<p><strong>Description :</strong> SCP-227-FR designates a machine similar in appearance to a modified photo booth of the brand Photomaton, measuring 3.10 x 2.20 x 0.50\u00a0m and painted in black and navy blue.</p>\n<p>Its front is equipped with two slots : a slot for one franc coins permitting a \"horoscope s\u00e9ance\" and a slot on a small receptacle which dispenses a paper containing a written message at the end of the s\u00e9ance.</p>\n<p>SCP-227-FR is topped with a panel designating it a \"HOROSCO-MATON\" (sic) and a poster on which is written:</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:110%;\"><strong>What future do THE STARS promise you?</strong></span><br/>\nUnlucky in love ? Dreams of promotion ? Discover what the future has in store for you today thanks to the revolutionary Horoscomaton\u00ae !<br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:80%;\">Because apparently your destiny is dictated by balls of hydrogen in fusion thousands of light years from you, so why not let a machine extrapolate all this to give you even more rules for how you should live your life?</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<br/>\nThe inside of SCP-227-FR is painted white and equipped with a halogen light bulb in the roof, a white adjustable stool, a black velvet curtain at the entry and a cathode screen inset in the wall across from the stool.\n<p>It should also be noted that, despite being equipped with an electrical plug, SCP-227-FR does not seem to require being plugged-in in order to function.</p>\n<p>When any person (hereafter designated \"subject\") sits within the chamber after having inserted a one (1) franc coin, the screen will turn itself on and display a message asking the subject to place their hand on the screen and count to five, so that the machine can establish a \"palmistry appraisal\" which supposedly allows SCP-227-FR to obtain information utilized in its calculations<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>Once the subject has complied, the screen will briefly display a loading screen before showing a file containing multiple instances of specific information concerning the subject.

The response seems to always be taken into consideration, despite the absence of a receiver within the booth. Once the subject has confirmed the displayed information, the screen will direct the subject towards the exterior receptacle where a strip of paper with the written prediction will be output.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup>. Once the subject exits, the screen will turn itself off and a strip of paper will output.</p>\n<p>The first strip of paper produced will display vague and common information relating to the subject's past. The subject will express disappointment, indifference or anger and will, in every case, experience a sensation of intense displeasure, believing themself to have fallen victim to a prank. Over the course of the week following the subject's interaction with SCP-227-FR, the subject will feel an increasing desire to reuse the booth, under the pretext of verifying if the machine is in working order or if the result remains the same. This marks the habit forming phase.</p>\n<p>The habit forming phase lasts about twenty-five days. Each time the subject returns to use SCP-227-FR, the information output will be increasingly precise and relate to the increasingly recent past.</p>\n<p>The habit forming phase will finish with the \"critical synchronization\" moment during which the machine will no no longer predict the past but instead the present.Critical synchronization will occur between the twenty-first and twenty-eighth days. The output message is invariably:</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>You are currently reading this paper.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>Following critical synchronization, the subject's addiction to SCP-227-FR is considered incurable, and the subject will have a pathological need to try SCP-227-FR at least once per day<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup>. This signifies the beginning of the anticipation phase.</p>\n<p>Once the critical prediction has passed, SCP-227-FR will begin to generate legitimate predictions concerning the future of the subject. This begins with extremely specific predictions concerning the near future, in the following hours, before increasingly moving towards more general predictions concerning the increasingly distant future.</p>\n<p>These predictions are consistently accurate. Unfortunately, the predictions concern the D-Class subjects, too useless and too vague, displaying no information relevant to the Foundation.</p>\n<p>Problems caused by the onset addiction prevents any usage of SCP-227-FR by researcher or security personnel.

Rather, it dictates their future and subjects follow these predictions. Predictions will increasingly define the actions of subjects around a pre-established behavioral model which the subject will progressively adopt. The longer a subject is exposed to SCP-227-FR the more extreme this behavior will become, and the subject's mental health will irreversibly degrade.</p>\n<p>After ten to fifteen days in the anticipation phase, these effects will be followed by physical transformations, discrete at first, but but which become further pronounced and dangerous to the subject's morphology after this time. When these physical and mental modifications begin, the subject becomes an instance of SCP-227-FR-2</p>\n<p>Exerts of test logs are available below for a more precise illustration of the effects of SCP-227-FR.

Given the lengthy onset time of the anomaly's effects on test subjects (four weeks before attaining critical synchronization, followed by an indefinite period of continued testing as per Protocol 227-T), D-Class used in tests are exempt from monthly termination. A stock of ancient one (1) franc coins must be available to researchers during testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Description :** SCP-227-FR designates a machine similar in appearance to a modified photo booth of the brand Photomaton, measuring 3.10 x 2.20 x 0.50 m and painted in black and navy blue.\n\n\n\nIts front is equipped with two slots : a slot for one franc coins permitting a \"horoscope s\u00e9ance\" and a slot on a small receptacle which dispenses a paper containing a written message at the end of the s\u00e9ance. \n\n\n\nSCP-227-FR is topped with a panel designating it a \"HOROSCO-MATON\" (sic) and a poster on which is written:\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n> [[size 110%]] **What future do THE STARS promise you?** [[/size]]\n\n> Unlucky in love ? Dreams of promotion ? Discover what the future has in store for you today thanks to the revolutionary Horoscomaton\u00ae !\n\n> [[size 80%]] Because apparently your destiny is dictated by balls of hydrogen in fusion thousands of light years from you, so why not let a machine extrapolate all this to give you even more rules for how you should live your life? [[/size]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\nThe inside of SCP-227-FR is painted white and equipped with a halogen light bulb in the roof, a white adjustable stool, a black velvet curtain at the entry and a cathode screen inset in the wall across from the stool.\n\n\n\nIt should also be noted that, despite being equipped with an electrical plug, SCP-227-FR does not seem to require being plugged-in in order to function.\n\n\n\nWhen any person (hereafter designated \"subject\") sits within the chamber after having inserted a one (1) franc coin, the screen will turn itself on and display a message asking the subject to place their hand on the screen and count to five, so that the machine can establish a \"palmistry appraisal\" which supposedly allows SCP-227-FR to obtain information utilized in its calculations[[footnote]] It has as of yet not been determined if the machine performs calculations in the traditional sense. Truthfully, we know nothing of its function, nor where it gets its information. [[/footnote]].\n\n\n\nOnce the subject has complied, the screen will briefly display a loading screen before showing a file containing multiple instances of specific information concerning the subject. This information is always rigorously exact and includes:\n\n\n\n* The date and time of the birth of the subject.\n\n* The geographic coordinates of the place of birth of the subject.\n\n* Their astrological sign.\n\n* Their rising sign.\n\n* Their dominant hand (left-handed, right-handed or ambidextrous).\n\n* A secret (too insignificant to be exploited by the Foundation).\n\n\n\nFollowing this, the screen will prompt the subject to orally confirm the information displayed by saying \"YES\" or \"NO\". The response seems to always be taken into consideration, despite the absence of a receiver within the booth. Once the subject has confirmed the displayed information, the screen will direct the subject towards the exterior receptacle where a strip of paper with the written prediction will be output.[[footnote]] Given that the information displayed is always correct, answering \"NO\" purposely will cause SCP-227-FR to instantly shut off. [[/footnote]]. Once the subject exits, the screen will turn itself off and a strip of paper will output.\n\n\n\nThe first strip of paper produced will display vague and common information relating to the subject's past. The subject will express disappointment, indifference or anger and will, in every case, experience a sensation of intense displeasure, believing themself to have fallen victim to a prank. Over the course of the week following the subject's interaction with SCP-227-FR, the subject will feel an increasing desire to reuse the booth, under the pretext of verifying if the machine is in working order or if the result remains the same. This marks the habit forming phase.\n\n\n\nThe habit forming phase lasts about twenty-five days. Each time the subject returns to use SCP-227-FR, the information output will be increasingly precise and relate to the increasingly recent past.\n\n\n\nThe habit forming phase will finish with the \"critical synchronization\" moment during which the machine will no no longer predict the past but instead the present.Critical synchronization\u00a0\u00a0will occur between the twenty-first and twenty-eighth days. The output message is invariably:\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n> You are currently reading this paper.\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nFollowing critical synchronization, the subject's addiction to SCP-227-FR is considered incurable, and the subject will have a pathological need to try SCP-227-FR at least once per day[[footnote]]if the subject is unable to regularly reach the cabinet, they will experience symptoms ranging from nausea or anxiety attacks to seizures or becoming comatose.[[/footnote]]. This signifies the beginning of the anticipation phase.\n\n\n\nOnce the critical prediction has passed, SCP-227-FR will begin to generate legitimate predictions concerning the future of the subject. This begins with extremely specific predictions concerning the near future, in the following hours, before increasingly moving towards more general predictions concerning the increasingly distant future.\n\n\n\nThese predictions are consistently accurate. Unfortunately, the predictions concern the D-Class subjects, too useless and too vague, displaying no information relevant to the Foundation.\n\n\n\nProblems caused by the onset addiction prevents any usage of SCP-227-FR by researcher or security personnel. Any personnel found attempting to make use of the anomaly will be amnesticized. \n\n\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Level 2/277 Access Required\" hide=\"Access Granted\"]]\n\n**Item # :** SCP-227-FR\n\n\n\n**Object Class :** Euclid\n\n\n\n**Threat Level:** --Yellow [[span style=\"color:yellow\"]]\u25cf[[/span]]-- Orange [[span style=\"color:orange\"]]\u25cf[[/span]]\n\n\n\n**Updated Containment Procedures :** All D-Class test subjects must be executed upon conclusion of the testing period. D-Class in the advanced transformation phase must be placed in separate cells. A medical team composed of morphology specialists and a psychologist must inspect the subjects after each s\u00e9ance. Security personnel must be reinforced by at least six additional personnel so as to avoid attacks or escape attempts by subjects.\n\n\n\n**Anticipation phase :** The anticipation phase of SCP-227-FR does not predict the future of subjects. Rather, it dictates their future and subjects follow these predictions. Predictions will increasingly define the actions of subjects around a pre-established behavioral model which the subject will progressively adopt. The longer a subject is exposed to SCP-227-FR the more extreme this behavior will become, and the subject's mental health will irreversibly degrade.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter ten to fifteen days in the anticipation phase, these effects will be followed by physical transformations, discrete at first, but but which become further pronounced and dangerous to the subject's morphology after this time. When these physical and mental modifications begin, the subject becomes an instance of SCP-227-FR-2\n\n\n\n\n\nExerts of test logs are available below for a more precise illustration of the effects of SCP-227-FR. The logs in their entirety are available at the Department of Archives. \n\n\n\n\n\n**Test Journal n^^o^^ 25 :**\n\n> **Subject :** D-8992\n\n> **Date of birth** 18/08/1976\n\n> \n\n> S\u00e9ance 26 : Critical synchronization occurred yesterday. Subject is in good shape. SCP-227-FR has predicted he will stub his big toe against the wall while exiting the room, prediction confirmed.\n\n> \n\n> S\u00e9ance 28 : D-8992, habitually imprisoned, begins showing increased empathy. SCP-227-FR has predicted that he will \"be more sociable this week without having to leave home\" \n\n> \n\n> S\u00e9ance 35 : D-8992 is presently largely extroverted. Two guards have been reassigned as they were becoming too attached and lost their objectivity.\n\n> \n\n> S\u00e9ance 40 :Female personnel are temporarily disallowed, at least concerning D-8992. You'd think he's at home here, and that we are his guests. A strict diminishing of communications between the subject and researcher personnel. Abnormal augmentation of body hair growth in the subject. D-8992 has presently become an instance of SCP-227-FR-2\n\n> \n\n> S\u00e9ance 54 : SCP-227-FR-2 has become increasingly aggressive towards personnel. Very prideful. Subject's diet now composed entirely of meat. Length of claws : 2.6 cm. Spine deformed, strength and agility greatly increased. Request that SCP-227-FR-2 be gagged to prevent speaking. Extreme influence over all personnel, myself included. \n\n> \n\n> S\u00e9ance 56 : [DATA EXPUNGED] SCP-227-FR-2 instance terminated.\n\n\n\n**Test Journal n^^o^^ 38 :**\n\n> **Subjet :** D-2256\n\n> **Date of Birth :** 24/10/1972\n\n> \n\n> S\u00e9ance 24 : Critical synchronization accomplished yesterday. D-2256's addiction seems particularly pronounced. SCP-227-FR predicts that the subject would \"anger himself with someone better armed than he\". Fatally, D-2256 began hostilities with a guard. Medical aid was correctly administered.\n\n> \n\n> S\u00e9ance 29 : SCP-227-FR has told D-2256 to \"beware malevolent persons of his entourage that will seek to use him\". This has considerably increased the subject's paranoia, who was already psychologically unstable.\n\n> \n\n> S\u00e9ance 36 : D-2256 is increasingly agitated, aggressive and impulsive. Modification of his dermis has rendered his skin particularly dry. I request that he be immediately classified as an instance of SCP-227-FR-2.\n\n> \n\n> S\u00e9ance 39 : The body of SCP-227-FR-2 is currently partially covered by brown scales. Tissue samples sent to lab for analysis. Extremities seem to retract within themselves. SCP-227-FR-2 instance difficult to control. His aggressiveness and his excitement largely compensate for his clumsiness. \n\n> \n\n> S\u00e9ance 45 : SCP-227-FR-2 grievously injured two guards since beginning testing. Noting a start of fusion of his metacarpals and an abnormal deformation in the pelvic region. An abnormal toxic substance has also been revealed in his cells. Analyses are in progress. Testing has been temporarily delayed.\n\n> \n\n> S\u00e9ance 47 : [DATA EXPUNGED] SCP-227-FR-2 instance terminated.\n\n\n\n**Test Journal n^^o^^ 44 :**\n\n> **Subjet :** D-6317\n\n> **Date of Birth :** 12/09/1981\n\n> \n\n> S\u00e9ance 21 : Critical synchronization accomplished yesterday. SCP-227-FR predicted that D-6317 will drop his glass during lunch. Prediction verified, gesture doubtless unconscious and influenced by message.\n\n> \n\n> S\u00e9ance 29 : SCP-227-FR predicted that \"your critiques will aid others to improve\". It seems that D-6317 feels obligated to follow this indication and constantly critique each of our acts over the course of testing.\n\n> \n\n> S\u00e9ance 34 : D-6317 is increasingly calm, and seems constantly concentrated, absent. This makes things easier. No physical changes apparent for the moment. Slow onset of OCD, it seems, without counting his criticisms which, if they continue, at least have the upside of being calm.\n\n> \n\n> S\u00e9ance 40 : It seems that D-6317 is tempted to attempt escape tonight. Well, to tell the truth, he //did// escape. Video logs indicate shockingly accurate timing and precision, combined with a memory and observation sense much higher than average, as shown in testing. Whatever the case: addiction has pushed D-6317 to return less than 5 hours later. Caution recommended. A physical exam has proved that certain scars of D-6317, under the chin and on the right thigh, have vanished. Instance classified as SCP-227-FR-2\n\n> \n\n> S\u00e9ance 46 : SCP-227-FR-2 has indicated urinary problems, lab tests in progress. Outside of this, he is strangely silent and seems less sensitive to external stimuli. His visual acuity seems to have greatly ameliorated. His OCD has pushed him to remark on a stain upon the floor of Test Chamber 29-B //at the other end of the hall.// \n\n> \n\n> S\u00e9ance 49 : General atrophy of SCP-227-FR-2's genitals. Does not seem to be in pain. All traces of physical sequelae seem to have vanished. Tests show that inflicted injuries heal within the following hour.\n\n> \n\n> S\u00e9ance 50 : [DATA EXPUNGED] SCP-227-FR-2 instance terminated.\n\n\n\n**Incident 227-01 :** \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/19\u2588\u2588, Seeing as how scans of the mechanism within the cabinet have given no results, if has been decided to present SCP-227-FR to the Department of Engineering and Technical Services (DE&TS) so as to disassemble the machine and learn more about its internal function. While Chief Engineer Girouard began to unscrew the rear panel of the machine, an asteroid of 2 cm in diameter ( size calculated post-impact) broke through the roof of Containment Hangar-03 and [DATA EXPUNGED].\n\n\n\nFollowing this, SCP-227-FR produced a different message from its regular predictions.\n\nThe message read:\n\n\n\n> Be reasonable. Stars, future and death are all one. Penetrating the secret would only ruin the magic. Quit your naivety and take your destiny for what it is. Inevitable. Leave the cabinet to the fools.\n\n\n\nAll research into the internal mechanisms of SCP-227-FR have been suspended by order of the Site Director. \n\n\n\n> **Notice from the Site Director:** This incident proves that, contrary to what numerous researchers have thought, the sphere of influence of SCP-227-FR //far// exceeds the minds of the test subjects that use it. If we add this \"astronomical\" incident to the fourteen agents injured by SCP-227-FR-2 instances, I believe that SCP-227-FR represents a menace far greater than we thought. I'm ordering an increase in its threat level, as well as a stop to all tests for an indefinite period of time. Kybian is not equipped to deal with these fucking hybrids, and even less to stop the sky from falling on us!\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n<< [[[SCP-226-FR]]] | SCP-227-FR | [[[SCP-228-FR]]] >>\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n", "references": ["scp-226-fr", "scp-228-fr"], "scp": "SCP-227-FR", "scp_number": 227, "series": "international", "tags": ["_fr", "autonomous", "compulsion", "international", "mechanical", "predictive", "safe", "sapphire", "scp", "transfiguration"], "title": "SCP-227-FR", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-227-fr"}, "SCP-236-FR": {"created_at": "2020-02-29T16:11:00", "creator": "INT_Translator", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "INT_Translator", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/int-translator", "comment": "", "date": "2020-02-29T16:11:00"}, {"author": "INT_Translator", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/int-translator", "comment": "Uploaded file \"orage2.jpg\".", "date": "2020-02-29T16:13:00"}, {"author": "INT_Translator", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/int-translator", "comment": "Parent page set to: \"scp-international\".", "date": "2020-02-29T16:14:00"}, {"author": "INT_Translator", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/int-translator", "comment": "Added tags: immobile, indestructible, international, keter, loop, probability, religious, sapphire, scp, transfiguration, uncontained, vehicle.

Trespassers are to be stopped and interrogated to ensure they are not affiliated with the Group of Interest SAPPHIRE, then given amnestics and transported to the nearest coast. Satellite or meteorological records likely to reveal the existence of SCP-236-FR are to be altered by undercover agents.</p>\n<p>Ariel pocket submarines can be used to approach SCP-236-FR for testing or observational purposes. Nonetheless, personnel are to be reminded that said submarines cannot surface within 200 meters of the anomaly.</p>\n<p>A small artificial island named \"Eliphaz\" has been established 18 kilometers from SCP-236-FR to serve as a monitoring station for the Foundation. Immediately before an Ahithophel event, personnel and supplies present on-site are to be quintupled and prepared, starting February 28th of each leap year. Following Protocol Ahithophel, Eliphaz containment teams are granted unrestricted assets available throughout February 29th. Additionally, containment teams have full permission to perform whatever action proves necessary to protect civilians from Ahithophel events.</p>\n<p>Given the impossibility to predict the exact nature of an Ahithophel event, a containment specialists team (counseled by high-ranking members of at least eight major religions) must develop a containment plan on a case-by-case basis and transmit it to containment teams as early as 2:00 AM on February 29th for immediate execution. These plans will be updated as events unfold.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-236-FR is an unidentified liner located in the Norwegian Sea, at the coordinates 69.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00b0 N, 2.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u00b0 E. SCP-236-FR is completely stationary (though it has not dropped its anchor), and has not moved from its location since its discovery in 1996.</p>\n<p>SCP-236-FR is located in the center of an exceptionally strong thunderstorm approximately 3 kilometers in diameter. The storm is a force 11 on the Beaufort scale, causing a raging sea and preventing seafaring within a distance of 20 kilometers. However, within 300 meters of SCP-236-FR itself, the sea is completely calm, and all waves break at this point. Lightning bolts, being abnormally powerful and occurring at an average rate of eight bolts per minute, are always directed towards SCP-236-FR, but seem to disappear 300 meters away from it. This area is presumed to be a 0 on the Beaufort scale.</p>\n<p>The weather conditions around SCP-236-FR remain unchanged since 1996.</p>\n<p>SCP-236-FR cannot be photographed or filmed, and its physical presence cannot be recorded by any technological devices. It is possible to access the calm area surrounding SCP-236-FR via submarine, but every watercraft attempting to approach closer than 150 meters to SCP-236-FR will be instantaneously moved 150 meters across the area, opposite its initial direction. Due to this, it is impossible to approach SCP-236-FR. Visual reports and drawings made by observers at the edge of the calm area agree that SCP-236-FR appears to be 160 meters long and 20 meters wide, has three masts and a funnel, lacks portholes, and displays the name <em>\"The Parry\"</em> on its hull.</p>\n<p>Dutch maritime registers state that a disused French liner of the same name \"hurriedly sailed off\" in the middle of the night, on September 17th, 1993, without providing more details.</p>\n<p>SCP-236-FR passengers are referred to as SCP-236-FR-2. All entities within SCP-236-FR are identical: resembling humanoids that measure approximately 1.65 meters in height. Their skin is pale without noticeable blemishes, their pupils are entirely black, and they do not possess any form of facial hair, such as a beard, eyelashes, brows, or sideburns. All entities are clothed in a grey outfit, covering their entire body, extending from their shoulders to their feet. The outfit has long sleeves and falls to the bottom of the legs, subsuming the feet to form shoes. The material it is made from is undetermined. The outfits possess no fastenings, pockets or other distinguishing features.</p>\n<p>The entities within SCP-236-FR repeat the same activities each day on a loop, and have been doing so since 1996. The activities observed on the deck include moving, lying on the ground, sitting, and staring at the sea. It should be noted that, even if SCP-236-FR-2 instances stare at the thunderstorm or Foundation personnel, they seem not to notice them, and remain expressionless at all times.</p>\n<p>The number of instances of SCP-236-FR-2 is estimated at 121 specimens. It remains an estimate due to the entities all being identical, the entities repeating the same movements continuously, and only the deck being visible.</p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Dr.\u00a0Sertannet's\u00a0Notes\u00a0Regarding\u00a0SCP-236-FR's\u00a0Normative\u00a0Anomaly.</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Hide</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the face of the scientific enigma SCP-236-FR proposed upon its discovery, we decided to take drastic steps to figure out its Hume Level. The results were disappointing.</p>\n<p>Several anomalous locations have an astonishingly high Hume Level (going up to 50, or even 60 Humes) and have very odd occurrences. Other anomalous areas have a very low Hume Level (sometimes reaching as few as 0.3 Humes), and similarly, have odd occurrences.</p>\n<p>The Hume Level emitted by SCP-236-FR is two Humes, a perfect baseline. An absolutely normal area.</p>\n<p>At first we shrugged it off and opted for other leads, leaving the Kant counters online. It was only after three months of continual measures that it hit me: the Hume level inside SCP-236-FR was perfectly steady, always two. Make no mistakes \u2014 reality is in a state of perpetual evolution everywhere in our universe. Every place in the world undergoes a fluctuation of at least 0.1 Hume per hour! But not here. Never. The area surrounding SCP-236-FR displayed flawless normality.</p>\n<p>So my team and I, developed a new method of reality calculation. We knew how to calculate reality through Humes, but we needed to discover the stability, the intensity, of this level. We needed to discover the so-called \"Normality Level\" \u2014 measured through Sertannets (St). Modest, I know.</p>\n<p>You hear of Scranton Reality Anchors, used to prevent the fluctuation of reality. They stabilise reality at two Humes. If you place one, that area will have 2 Humes. Now place a second \u2014 the reality of the area will not change (still 2 Humes), but the effect will be doubled! Reality will become more stable!</p>\n<p>In such a case, we go from 1.8 Sertannets to 3.6 Sertannets on the Normality scale!</p>\n<p>Equipped with this new knowledge, we went back to get the measures of SCP-236-FR. The meter almost blew up! The Normality Level around SCP-236-FR is near \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Sertannets, which equates it to \u2588\u2588\u2588 Scranton Reality Anchors piled up on top of each other!</p>\n<p>Locked inside this bubble, SCP-236-FR passengers have probably been\u2026 <em>crushed</em> by the Normality. It explains their current condition: indistinguishable, plain, without\u2026 essence, if I may say. It also explains why nobody from the outside can approach the ship: we are, to put it simply, <em>too anomalous</em> to do that.</p>\n<p>Similarly, it explains the ship's defense against the highly anomalous thunderstorm surrounding it.</p>\n<p>Well, except for leap years, of course.</p>\n<p>I don't know why, but during those times, the Normality Level is inverted. We go from \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 to -\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. The consequence is that the Humes are entirely\u2026 devalued, I believe is the right word. The area still is technically at 2 Humes, but the Reality Level makes no sense without the Normality Level. It becomes both <em>too high</em> and <em>too low</em>. At the same time.</p>\n<p>Yes, it seems ludicrous.</p>\n<p>But that really is the nature of Ahithophel events.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>Ahithophel events occur once every four years, on February 29th of each leap year. Each event consists of a Normality inversion in a 300-meter area around SCP-236-FR, followed by reality collapsing.</p>\n<p>The cause of Ahithophel events is unknown, and they are as dangerous as they are unpredictable.</p>\n<p>Ahithophel events occur precisely on February 29th from 00:00:01 to 23:59:59. On-site teams are to handle the containment of the event's consequences, without regard to SCP-236-FR or SCP-236-FR-2.</p>\n<p>SCP-236-FR and SCP-236-FR-2 will spontaneously reappear in their place and in their original state on March 1st at 00:00:00.</p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Census\u00a0of\u00a0All\u00a0Ahithophel\u00a0Events\u00a0since\u00a01996\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Level\u00a03/236\u00a0Required.</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Hide</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<ul>\n<li>02/29/1996: A sonic boom is heard on both the Norwegian and Icelandic coasts.

Walls and floor structures are doubled: the outer walls, no less than 4.5 meters thick, are made of high-density pre-stressed concrete; the inner ones, 1.5 meters thick, are made of special \"adamant\" brand high-alloy steel (produced by Plant-45). The containment volume is fitted with two (2) sets of service entrance airlocks with class VI explosion resistance blast doors and an additional emergency quick-hardening compound sealing system.</p>\n<p>In the center of the containment volume there are two concentric icosahedron-shaped shells<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> installed, the diameters of their circumspheres being 8 and 12 meters respectively. The shells are supported by a two-spool suspension system and are additionally surrounded by a Faraday cage made of superconducting cable with cells no larger than 5\u00a0cm across.</p>\n<p>High vacuum inside the shells and the containment volume is maintained by two (2) main and six (6) backup heavy-duty turbomolecular pumps. The space between the inner and outer walls of the containment volume acts as forevacuum space and is pumped by four (4) main and four (4) reserve rotary vane pumps, which are capable of operating in an accelerated mode for no less than one (1) hour. Pumps are to be checked for serviceability on a weekly basis; preventive replacements and scheduled maintenance are to be conducted every two (2) months.</p>\n<p>Area-141's electric power supply consists of no fewer than two (2) independent external sources and two (main and reserve) stand-alone power systems with at least a 100% margin of capacity each.</p>\n<p>The central shells are identical in structure (except for respective dimensions) and both are constructed of 20 triangular titanium plates 1.5\u00a0cm thick, mounted on a steel skeleton and adjusted to minimize gap size along matching edges. One of the plates of each shell is to be mounted on a guide rail serving as an access port, which can only be opened from the outside. The frames in question are to be connected to a stabilized voltage supply, maintaining a potential difference of 120V across the structure.</p>\n<p>The inner surfaces of the shells are covered with luminophore compounds that radiate when conducting electricity and produce afterglow for 20 min in case of power failure. Luminophores of different colors make up an image \u2014 a memetically active visual representation of a so-called \"Wei\u00dfschatten's imperceivable extradimensional paradox\" that irreversibly destroys general perception processes upon being perceived. Another board with the same image is located behind the outer shell access hatch, placed in such a way so as to obstruct the view of the region within three (3) metres of the shell's geometric center, should the outer shell access hatch be opened while the inner shell is compromised. Shell integrity checkup is to be conducted at least once every two weeks.</p>\n<p>Inside the containment volume the following objects are also situated:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 spontaneous decoherence generators<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> (spec. product 2470-a)</li>\n<li>3 zero-veil generators<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup> (spec. product 2470-b)</li>\n<li>a telepathy suppression device, created using SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 (spec. product 2470-c)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is essential to maintain a full stock of the aforementioned devices.

One of the employees enters the inner shell; the other remains inside the external shell and locks the hatch from the outside.<br/>\n<strong>8.</strong> Examination of the inner surface by the incomer. It is essential to avoid any contact with the area within 3 meters of the geometrical center during the examination. Regulated procedure time: 15 minutes.<br/>\n<strong>9.</strong> Regardless of the outcome of procedure #8, when finishing the 15-minute countdown, the incomer is to be in front of the hatch, being ready to leave.

However, it should also be kept in mind that a deviation from the routine containment mode, as long as it remains stable, is preferable to frequent and sudden changes of the object\u2019s surroundings; for this reason, containment restoration is to be conducted through decisive action, guaranteeing solid and sustainable results.</p>\n<p>In case of pressurization of the main containment volume, all turbomolecular pumps are to be shut off in order to prevent overload; all rotary vane pumps are to operate in overdrive mode to sustain a maximally achievable vacuum during recovery operations. If the air pressure inside of the containment volume exceeds 1\u00a0mbar, all the operations are to be conducted in sound dampening mode.</p>\n<p>In case of visible integrity loss in any of the central shells, said shell is considered beyond repair. Instead, a new shell with a diameter 2m greater than the current outer shell is to be constructed around the central shells, if the outer shell is intact, or two successive shells if both current shells are damaged. After a new shell is put into operation, the old one is to be dismantled, removed and remelted. The current dimensions of the containment volume allow to conduct the procedure as many as five (5) times; hence, after fourth occurence of shell integrity loss and subsequent recontainment as described above, site personnel is to initiate work on containment volume expansion.</p>\n<p>In case of significant damage to both of the shells and thus an inevitable breach of containment volume, protocol 2470-Alpha is to be engaged. High Command must be notified of the situation immediately through a special hotline. Contained objects of little avail classified as \u201cSafe\u201d or \u201cEuclid\u201d, preferably extradimensional, info- or cognitohazardous, self-replicating upon destruction, or having a particularly complex structure (see: approved SCP list), are to be brought to the breach zone before any containment restoration procedures take place.</p>\n<p>This measure is supposed to mitigate the object's destructive influence by forcing it to spend a significant amount of time fully analyzing the complexity and inconsistencies of the aforementioned objects, while their unique properties should not allow SCP-2470 to make any substantial conclusions regarding the properties and laws of baseline reality. Any risks related to object interactions are considered justified. Permanent deployment of some of the objects from the approved SCP list inside the facilities of Area-141 is currently under review.</p>\n<p>In case of a BI (Before Invasion) class or TCF (Total Containment Failure) class scenarios, if any local factors directly compromise the safety of Area-141, or by the order of the O5 Council, protocol 2470-Beta must be engaged in order to neutralize SCP-2470. Four executors (2 main, 2 backup) are to be selected from the approved list and delivered to Area-141. The subjects must receive instruction and conduct test procedures on D-class personnel. The main and backup pairs afterwards stand on duty with a five-minute notice to start the procedure, until protocol 2470-Beta is cancelled by a direct order from O5 Council.</p>\n<p>At the order of High Command, or in case of sudden aggravation of the situation and loss of communication with the headquarters, the neutralization procedure is to be enacted under Area Command responsibility. After it is confirmed to be successful, the executors (both pairs) and all the D-class personnel located in Area-141 are to be terminated, any documentation relevant to SCP-2470 is to be destroyed, and Area-141 is to be evacuated and destroyed via thermonuclear charge.</p>\n<p>Neutralization of the object, regardless of all the complexities of its containment, is the very last resort and is to be avoided until absolutely necessary. For this reason, subjects from the potential executors list are not to be present in Area-141 unless protocol 2470-Beta is engaged.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Hide</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Organizational\u00a0aspects</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Hide</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Due to the containment procedure complexity and unacceptable potential cost of error, a training complex has been established on Area 141 grounds for the purpose of general simulation of the containment volume and the containment area. All personnel involved with containment are to regularly practice under supervision of an authorized employee with level 3 clearance and take qualification tests at least monthly. Any non-routine works and procedures can only be carried out after training course simulations and rehearsals show a 100% success rate. Exceptions to this rule are permissible only on private order of Area Director in situations of extreme time pressure.</p>\n<p>Medical staff are to conduct physical examination of the working group prior to entering the containment volume and examine all Area-141 personnel monthly. Prior to deployment in Area-141, each member of the medical staff is to read, understand and sign the classified document 2470-x (attached) with a level 4 clearance employee as witness.</p>\n<p>Significant psychological tension caused by a large amount of important and demanding procedures associated with every entry into the containment volume (such as wearing and checking a full-body suit, passing through the four airlocks, calibrating numerous systems, working inside the shells under severe time pressure and others) necessitates extra attention to personnel\u2019s mental health.

Although there is no reason to believe the aforementioned cultists to have any significant forces at their disposal, they possess information about the object that may potentially help them attract the interest of, and gain support from, other potentially dangerous radical organizations. Because of that, MTF \u2588-\u2588\u2588 and \u2588-\u2588\u2588, apart from their main duties, are charged with monitoring the activity of any pro-apocalyptic groups and to actively instigate cultists to contact them by creating front radical organizations and sects.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Hide</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2470 is a specific existential entity, or a perceptive element, which is objectively an initial manifestation of a ZK-class scenario. Due to insuperable obstacles related to its perception, the object's appearance, if it has any, remains unknown. Its current locus is determined indirectly, based on the area of effect it produces.</p>\n<p>Said effect is manifested through the instantaneous disappearance of any object or event perceived by SCP-2470 from objective reality. First and foremost this applies to the most proximate aspects, which are directly accessible to the object\u2019s senses. Thereafter, as the object accumulates knowledge, gains abstract understanding of the nature of things, and makes generalizations, the effect extends to the phenomena themselves, their direct and later indirect consequences.</p>\n<p>For instance, during the initial recovery operation, it was noted that the sound of the agents' footsteps (said agents were obstructed from sight by smokescreens) was starting to drown out due to sonic oscillations having stopped. Soon afterwards, large volumes of the air itself started to spontaneously disappear, which caused hypobaric effects. This was followed by the disappearance of several agents' legs, and finally the agents disappeared wholly and completely. In a similar fashion, at first several clots of the aforementioned smokescreen disappeared, but the effect soon spread to whole smoke clouds, followed by all active smoke grenades at the operation site. This culminated with disappearance of all smoke grenades of that specific type at the operation site, regardless of their being within range of the object's perception.</p>\n<p>Disappearance of soil caused a crater up to 200 meters deep to manifest at the location of the object's discovery (apparently, the object was somehow confused that every demanifested volume of soil brought more into view, and that slowed the process down; it did not manage to realize the Earth as a limited and finite entity). Due to constant disappearances of air, atmospheric pressure has dropped at the operation site and a steady high-current cyclone has formed.</p>\n<p>Since any generalizations of reasons behind any phenomena inevitably lead to using abstract concepts and eventually lead to logically reasoning the universe's existence per se, SCP-2470 is classified as a potential ZK-class hazard.</p>\n<p>According to the analysis of gathered data it was reliably established that the object possesses the following senses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a perception of electromagnetic radiation in an extremely wide frequency range, including the visible spectrum, which is analogous to vision;</li>\n<li>a highly sensitive perception of mechanical stimuli, which is analogous to tactile sense and hearing;</li>\n<li>a perception of [DATA EXPUNGED]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following senses are reasonably likely to be possessed by the object:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a direct, yet severely limited, telepathic perception;</li>\n<li>a perception of certain quantum effects, particularly quantum superposition of states as a singular phenomenon.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The latter hypothesis is related to the events that happened during [REDACTED], as well as damage and demanifestation of (at least) equipment sensors and human sensory organs during attempts to perceive the object directly, which is apparently related to the wave function collapse that inevitably accompanies an act of perception and is seemingly perceivable by SCP-2470.</p>\n<p>Moreover, this hypothesis combined with the conclusion regarding [DATA EXPUNGED] provides an explanation to how the object manages to avoid exposure to \u201cWei\u00dfschatten\u2019s paradox\u201d: apparently, the effect of quantum entanglement of the object in present time with itself in an immediate future, allows it to foresee the damaging effect of the memetic agent without even having a concept of its nature, and, based on that information, allows SCP-2470 to refuse to perceive it (\"to close its eyes\", metaphorically speaking). However, the fact that this <em>modus operandi</em> remains its only manner of existence for \u2588 years in containment counts in favor of the paradox's adequacy and the proficiency of the developed neutralization procedure, which is based on a forceful inoculation of a destructive meme bypassing the object's senses.</p>\n<p>[INFORMATION IS REMOVED FROM PUBLIC ACCESS.

Actually, the origin of the effect resulting in a ZK-class scenario lies not within the object, as we got used to thinking, but within the whole outer world. It is not the object that tears fragments away from reality, but the reality itself discharging these fragments and casting them into the most fitting place \u2014 into the unfillable unbeing that is SCP-2470 \u2014 as soon as they form a strong enough causal connection with it.</p>\n<p>Unbeing, as the true nature of the object, originates as a result of every successful attempt to perceive it. Thus, as unbeing is a priori singular, part of the object manifests on the information medium or inside the perceiver's mind, destroying it directly. Under this hypothesis, this explains the above-referenced effects on perception.</p>\n<p>From this perspective the cognizing nature of the object appears to be merely an illusion, caused by its dualistic position relative to the \"forgetting\" nature of the universe, though a virtual cogniton<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-4\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')\">4</a></sup> related to the object, created by this impact, appears to be indistinguishable from a real one (moreover, the concepts of \"real\" and \"objective\" appear to be conventional and hardly applicable in the given context). This is what determines the object's inability to perceive \u201cWei\u00dfschatten\u2019s paradox\u201d, but in this case it appears to be an objective and natural limitation, not related to a willed refusal to perceive. From this point of view the effectiveness of the developed neutralization procedure seems very dubious.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Recovery Log:</strong> The first report of the object's anomalous activity came on \u2588\u2588.\u2588\u2588.20\u2588\u2588 at about \u2588\u2588:00 from an airplane observer of FGU \u201cAvialesookhrana\u201d<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-5\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')\">5</a></sup>, who was conducting fire safety monitoring in the [REDACTED] area. The pilot reported a huge deforested area centered around a wide, deep cavity. Communication with the pilot ceased soon afterwards. The report was intercepted by undercover Foundation agents in the MES and a reconnaissance operation with \u2588 mobile task forces was arranged.</p>\n<p>Initial hypotheses regarding the object's nature were defining it as something akin to a miniature black hole. However, primary analysis disproved this point of view and demonstrated the true nature of the anomaly. Several methods of containment and/or neutralization, such as [DATA EXPUNGED] had been applied unsuccessfully, and were followed by a proposal to use \u201cWei\u00dfschatten\u2019s paradox\u201d in order to neutralize the object. This attempt was a partial success. Neutralization was not achieved; however, it was discovered that the paradox\u2019s carrier was not susceptible to the object\u2019s effect, which allowed the Foundation to capture SCP-2470 after several unsuccessful attempts and to develop the current containment protocols. Total losses throughout the whole operation amount to \u2588\u2588\u2588 employees.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Excerpt from Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's report:</strong></p>\n<p>There was a remarkable episode during one of the first attempts of neutralization, when, at the suggestion of agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a mirror was placed within the object\u2019s field of view. It seemed logical that, after seeing its own reflection, the object would neutralize itself. However, though the other things reflected in the mirror were subjected to its effect to the full, the object itself did not undergo any changes. Instead, it destroyed the mirror, although this action took it 12 seconds more than it usually took for items of similar scale. Also, it is obvious that the object has not been self-destructing due to self-awareness for \u2588 years already. This can be rationalized by one of the following hypotheses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the object is either able to apply its effects selectively or is passively non-susceptible to them;</li>\n<li>the object is either unable to perceive itself, or is avoiding that;</li>\n<li>the object itself is uncognizable;</li>\n<li>the cognizable nature of the object is actually the object itself; any sort of cognition results in the object's duplication, which equals to the object growing due to its indivisible nature.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The last hypothesis [DATA EXPUNGED] for more precise control.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to the data gathered later on, a small village of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 which had been abandoned since at least the late 80s had been situated at the initial discovery site. However, a few years before the anomaly appeared, it had been occupied with members of an unidentified, radical pro-apocalyptic religious community. The evidence of their activity is sketchy and inconsistent, though it suggests that [DATA EXPUNGED].</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 1:</strong></p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">The\u00a0O5-\u2588\u2019s\u00a0memorandum\u00a0to\u00a0Area-141\u00a0personnel</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">The\u00a0transcript\u00a0of\u00a0O5-\u2588\u2019s\u00a0message\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0personnel\u00a0of\u00a0Area-141\u00a0(hide)</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dear colleagues!<br/>\nAfter the command of Area-141 informed me of certain popular perceptions among your community, I saw it right to explain certain particularities regarding our policy on SCP-2470.</p>\n<p>Yes, this object is exactly as dangerous as you were told or, probably, even more. Thus far our only salvation was the fact that the embryonic state of its mind cannot comprehend many of the things we consider obvious: that air is not nothingness and exists not just when it feels a breeze, that Earth is a celestial body of a finite size, that the Sun is not a flat shining spot on the horizon, that people, despite how different they are, all represent humankind as a whole, and so on.</p>\n<p>Yes, it is essential to keep the object in complete isolation and to avert any transmission of the most insignificant information at any cost.

Why are we not engaging it?</p>\n<p>The reason is because the containment itself is of a huge strategic value to us. The thing is, according to research on this subject, simultaneous occurrence of <em>two</em> ZK-class scenarios is fundamentally impossible. Therefore, as long as one of them is being contained, we guarantee that the others, which might not be so easily controlled anyhow, will not happen.</p>\n<p>In fact, we were very lucky that this object took a form that can be contained at acceptable cost, so it would not be sensible to lose such opportunity.

Due to the extremely hazardous nature of SCP-2470,\u00a0\u00a0as well as the potential threat from pro-apocalyptic religious-mystical movements and sects, on-site personnel are responsible for both containing the object, and protecting Area-141 from any and all outside threats.\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Containment Zone structure\" hide=\"Hide\" hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n\nThe central containment volume of Area-141 headquarters is a hyperboloid-shaped room with a lower base diameter of 55 meters, upper base diameter of 42 meters, and 36 meters in height. Walls and floor structures are doubled: the outer walls, no less than 4.5 meters thick, are made of high-density pre-stressed concrete; the inner ones, 1.5 meters thick, are made of special \"adamant\" brand high-alloy steel (produced by Plant-45). The containment volume is fitted with two (2) sets of service entrance airlocks with class VI explosion resistance blast doors and an additional emergency quick-hardening compound sealing system.\n\n\n\nIn the center of the containment volume there are two concentric icosahedron-shaped shells[[footnote]] polyhedron with 20 faces [[/footnote]] installed, the diameters of their circumspheres being 8 and 12 meters respectively. The shells are supported by a two-spool suspension system and are additionally surrounded by a Faraday cage made of superconducting cable with cells no larger than 5 cm across.\n\n\n\nHigh vacuum inside the shells and the containment volume is maintained by two (2) main and six (6) backup heavy-duty turbomolecular pumps. The space between the inner and outer walls of the containment volume acts as forevacuum space and is pumped by four (4) main and four (4) reserve rotary vane pumps, which are capable of operating in an accelerated mode for no less than one (1) hour. Pumps are to be checked for serviceability on a weekly basis; preventive replacements and scheduled maintenance are to be conducted every two (2) months.\n\n\n\nArea-141's electric power supply consists of no fewer than two (2) independent external sources and two (main and reserve) stand-alone power systems with at least a 100% margin of capacity each.\n\n\n\nThe central shells are identical in structure (except for respective dimensions) and both are constructed of 20 triangular titanium plates 1.5 cm thick, mounted on a steel skeleton and adjusted to minimize gap size along matching edges. One of the plates of each shell is to be mounted on a guide rail serving as an access port, which can only be opened from the outside. The frames in question are to be connected to a stabilized voltage supply, maintaining a potential difference of 120V across the structure. \n\n\n\nThe inner surfaces of the shells are covered with luminophore compounds that radiate when conducting electricity and produce afterglow for 20 min in case of power failure. Luminophores of different colors make up an image -- a memetically active visual representation of a so-called \"Wei\u00dfschatten's imperceivable extradimensional paradox\" that irreversibly destroys general perception processes upon being perceived. Another board with the same image is located behind the outer shell access hatch, placed in such a way so as to obstruct the view of the region within three (3) metres of the shell's geometric center, should the outer shell access hatch be opened while the inner shell is compromised. Shell integrity checkup is to be conducted at least once every two weeks.\n\n\n\nInside the containment volume the following objects are also situated:\n\n* 2 spontaneous decoherence generators[[footnote]] destruction of the phenomenon of quantum entaglement[[/footnote]] (spec. product 2470-a)\n\n* 3 zero-veil generators[[footnote]]a code name; used as a mean of suppression of [REDACTED].[[/footnote]] (spec. product 2470-b)\n\n* a telepathy suppression device, created using SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 (spec. product 2470-c)\n\n\n\nIt is essential to maintain a full stock of the aforementioned devices. In case stock supplies diminish, replacement devices are to be manufactured by the Foundation's corresponding facilities upon first request, as soon as possible, and with the highest priority. The operation procedures are explained in the corresponding manuals attached therein.\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Work regulations in the containment area\" hide=\"Hide\" hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n\nAll works inside the containment volume are carried out by groups of no fewer than three (3) grade IV engineers, who received appropriate training and passed qualifying examination.\n\n\n\nAny works that have to be performed outside the central shells are to be conducted preferably using robots controlled remotely via a fiber-optic cable; in case human intervention is necessary, personnel must operate wearing full-body suits with fiber-optic communication. All types of wireless devices are forbidden to be handled and/or used inside the containment volume.\n\n\n\nInternal examination of the central shells is conducted only by people wearing special \u201cDissonance\u201d full-body suits (spec. product 2470-d). The suit includes: \n\n* a \u201cWei\u00dfschatten\u2019s paradox\u201d memetic agent displaying system with 100% external area coverage;\n\n* a spectrum-correcting system built into the HUD; said system is attuned to the wavelengths the luminophore compound cells radiate in and makes the memetic agent safe for perception by suppressing specific colors;\n\n* a spatial image filtration system with high precision inertial control, that blocks the view of the area within 3 meters of the shell's geometrical center;\n\n* a chronometer with voice countdown for preset periods.\n\n\n\nAny forms of interaction between the personnel inside and outside the shells are forbidden. Staff members inside the shells communicate between each other using a set of hand signals.\n\n\n\nThe procedure of planned internal examination of the shells is performed along the following steps:\n\n**1.** Synchronizing chronometers (may be done immediately before entering the containment volume).\n\n**2.** Inertial control system calibration. It is to be done right in front of the external shell\u2019s hatch to avoid error accumulation. \n\n**3.** Activating the image filtration system, switching on the memetic agent display.\n\n**4.** Opening the external shell\u2019s hatch, starting 35-minute countdown. Two employees enter the external shell, the third one stays outside and locks the hatch behind them.\n\n**5.** One of the incomers examines the inner surface of the external shell for any integrity violations; the second examines the outer surface of the inner shell. Regulated procedure time: 15 minutes.\n\n**6.** After finishing the procedure #5 the employees, considering the time left, make a decision on entering the inner shell. In case a negative decision is reached, see #10. In case of a positive decision:\n\n**7.** Opening the hatch of the inner shell. Starting the 15-minute countdown. One of the employees enters the inner shell; the other remains inside the external shell and locks the hatch from the outside.\n\n**8.** Examination of the inner surface by the incomer. It is essential to avoid any contact with the area within 3 meters of the geometrical center during the examination. Regulated procedure time: 15 minutes.\n\n**9.** Regardless of the outcome of procedure #8, when finishing the 15-minute countdown, the incomer is to be in front of the hatch, being ready to leave. The hatch is to be opened by the employee outside exactly by the time the countdown is finished and only for 20 seconds, and closed and locked afterwards, regardless of circumstances.\n\n**10.** By the time the 35-minute countdown is finished, both employees are to stay near the external shell\u2019s hatch. The hatch is to be opened by the employee outside exactly by the time the countdown finishes and only for 40 seconds, and closed and locked afterwards, regardless of circumstances.\n\n**11.** Leaving the containment volume. Debriefing and progress report to the operator. In case procedures were not carried out in full, another team is to be prepared for second examination. The second examination is to be conducted completely, regardless of progress of the previous team. \n\n\n\nEmployees failing to leave the shells on time are considered KIA; no rescue missions are to be attempted under any circumstances. In case said employees are found during subsequent examinations, they are to be removed from the shells and remanded to medical staff immediately; taking off the suit and providing medical care is forbidden for any employees other than medical staff.\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Emergency protocols\" hide=\"Hide\" hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n\nTransmission of information about the outside world into the shells in a form perceivable by the object (see description), even if not having observable consequences, is to be classified as a containment breach and aborted as soon as possible; termination of any employee is permitted if required to enact such. However, it should also be kept in mind that a deviation from the routine containment mode, as long as it remains stable, is preferable to frequent and sudden changes of the object\u2019s surroundings; for this reason, containment restoration is to be conducted through decisive action, guaranteeing solid and sustainable results.\n\n\n\nIn case of pressurization of the main containment volume, all turbomolecular pumps are to be shut off in order to prevent overload; all rotary vane pumps are to operate in overdrive mode to sustain a maximally achievable vacuum during recovery operations. If the air pressure inside of the containment volume exceeds 1 mbar, all the operations are to be conducted in sound dampening mode.\n\n\n\nIn case of visible integrity loss in any of the central shells, said shell is considered beyond repair. Instead, a new shell with a diameter 2m greater than the current outer shell is to be constructed around the central shells, if the outer shell is intact, or two successive shells if both current shells are damaged. After a new shell is put into operation, the old one is to be dismantled, removed and remelted. The current dimensions of the containment volume allow to conduct the procedure as many as five (5) times; hence, after fourth occurence of shell integrity loss and subsequent recontainment as described above, site personnel is to initiate work on containment volume expansion.\n\n\n\nIn case of significant damage to both of the shells and thus an inevitable breach of containment volume, protocol 2470-Alpha is to be engaged. High Command must be notified of the situation immediately through a special hotline. Contained objects of little avail classified as \u201cSafe\u201d or \u201cEuclid\u201d, preferably extradimensional, info- or cognitohazardous, self-replicating upon destruction, or having a particularly complex structure (see: approved SCP list), are to be brought to the breach zone before any containment restoration procedures take place.\n\n\n\nThis measure is supposed to mitigate the object's destructive influence by forcing it to spend a significant amount of time fully analyzing the complexity and inconsistencies of the aforementioned objects, while their unique properties should not allow SCP-2470 to make any substantial conclusions regarding the properties and laws of baseline reality. Any risks related to object interactions are considered justified. Permanent deployment of some of the objects from the approved SCP list inside the facilities of Area-141 is currently under review.\n\n\n\nIn case of a BI (Before Invasion) class or TCF (Total Containment Failure) class scenarios, if any local factors directly compromise the safety of Area-141, or by the order of the O5 Council, protocol 2470-Beta must be engaged in order to neutralize SCP-2470. Four executors (2 main, 2 backup) are to be selected from the approved list and delivered to Area-141. The subjects must receive instruction and conduct test procedures on D-class personnel. The main and backup pairs afterwards stand on duty with a five-minute notice to start the procedure, until protocol 2470-Beta is cancelled by a direct order from O5 Council.\n\n\n\nAt the order of High Command, or in case of sudden aggravation of the situation and loss of communication with the headquarters, the neutralization procedure is to be enacted under Area Command responsibility. After it is confirmed to be successful, the executors (both pairs) and all the D-class personnel located in Area-141 are to be terminated, any documentation relevant to SCP-2470 is to be destroyed, and Area-141 is to be evacuated and destroyed via thermonuclear charge. \n\n\n\nNeutralization of the object, regardless of all the complexities of its containment, is the very last resort and is to be avoided until absolutely necessary. For this reason, subjects from the potential executors list are not to be present in Area-141 unless protocol 2470-Beta is engaged.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Organizational aspects\" hide=\"Hide\" hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n\nDue to the containment procedure complexity and unacceptable potential cost of error, a training complex has been established on Area 141 grounds for the purpose of general simulation of the containment volume and the containment area. All personnel involved with containment are to regularly practice under supervision of an authorized employee with level 3 clearance and take qualification tests at least monthly. Any non-routine works and procedures can only be carried out after training course simulations and rehearsals show a 100% success rate. Exceptions to this rule are permissible only on private order of Area Director in situations of extreme time pressure.\n\n\n\nMedical staff are to conduct physical examination of the working group prior to entering the containment volume and examine all Area-141 personnel monthly. Prior to deployment in Area-141, each member of the medical staff is to read, understand and sign the classified document 2470-x (attached) with a level 4 clearance employee as witness. \n\n\n\nSignificant psychological tension caused by a large amount of important and demanding procedures associated with every entry into the containment volume (such as wearing and checking a full-body suit, passing through the four airlocks, calibrating numerous systems, working inside the shells under severe time pressure and others) necessitates extra attention to personnel\u2019s mental health. Engineers assigned to the containment volume are to be given additional vacations.\n\n\n\nAny and all research of SCP-2470 is currently forbidden. Access to the archive of previously gained/retrieved information for purposes of analysis is allowed for employees with level 3 clearance or above by direct approval of at least two O5 members.\n\n\n\nAs it is suspected that some members of the sect presumably responsible for the object's appearance or connected to it may be still alive and at large, Area-141 is considered to be under aggressive threat. Although there is no reason to believe the aforementioned cultists to have any significant forces at their disposal, they possess information about the object that may potentially help them attract the interest of, and gain support from, other potentially dangerous radical organizations. Because of that, MTF \u2588-\u2588\u2588 and \u2588-\u2588\u2588, apart from their main duties, are charged with monitoring the activity of any pro-apocalyptic groups and to actively instigate cultists to contact them by creating front radical organizations and sects.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-2470 is a specific existential entity, or a perceptive element, which is objectively an initial manifestation of a ZK-class scenario. Due to insuperable obstacles related to its perception, the object's appearance, if it has any, remains unknown. Its current locus is determined indirectly, based on the area of effect it produces.\n\n\n\nSaid effect is manifested through the instantaneous disappearance of any object or event perceived by SCP-2470 from objective reality. First and foremost this applies to the most proximate aspects, which are directly accessible to the object\u2019s senses. Thereafter, as the object accumulates knowledge, gains abstract understanding of the nature of things, and makes generalizations, the effect extends to the phenomena themselves, their direct and later indirect consequences.\n\n\n\nFor instance, during the initial recovery operation, it was noted that the sound of the agents' footsteps (said agents were obstructed from sight by smokescreens) was starting to drown out due to sonic oscillations having stopped. Soon afterwards, large volumes of the air itself started to spontaneously disappear, which caused hypobaric effects. This was followed by the disappearance of several agents' legs, and finally the agents disappeared wholly and completely. In a similar fashion, at first several clots of the aforementioned smokescreen disappeared, but the effect soon spread to whole smoke clouds, followed by all active smoke grenades at the operation site. This culminated with disappearance of all smoke grenades of that specific type at the operation site, regardless of their being within range of the object's perception.\n\n\n\nDisappearance of soil caused a crater up to 200 meters deep to manifest at the location of the object's discovery (apparently, the object was somehow confused that every demanifested volume of soil brought more into view, and that slowed the process down; it did not manage to realize the Earth as a limited and finite entity). Due to constant disappearances of air, atmospheric pressure has dropped at the operation site and a steady high-current cyclone has formed. \n\n\n\nSince any generalizations of reasons behind any phenomena inevitably lead to using abstract concepts and eventually lead to logically reasoning the universe's existence per se, SCP-2470 is classified as a potential ZK-class hazard.\n\n\n\nAccording to the analysis of gathered data it was reliably established that the object possesses the following senses:\n\n* a perception of electromagnetic radiation in an extremely wide frequency range, including the visible spectrum, which is analogous to vision;\n\n* a highly sensitive perception of mechanical stimuli, which is analogous to tactile sense and hearing;\n\n* a perception of [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\nThe following senses are reasonably likely to be possessed by the object: \n\n* a direct, yet severely limited, telepathic perception;\n\n* a perception of certain quantum effects, particularly quantum superposition of states as a singular phenomenon.\n\n\n\nThe latter hypothesis is related to the events that happened during [REDACTED], as well as damage and demanifestation of (at least) equipment sensors and human sensory organs during attempts to perceive the object directly, which is apparently related to the wave function collapse that inevitably accompanies an act of perception and is seemingly perceivable by SCP-2470.\n\n\n\nMoreover, this hypothesis combined with the conclusion regarding [DATA EXPUNGED] provides an explanation to how the object manages to avoid exposure to \u201cWei\u00dfschatten\u2019s paradox\u201d: apparently, the effect of quantum entanglement of the object in present time with itself in an immediate future, allows it to foresee the damaging effect of the memetic agent without even having a concept of its nature, and, based on that information, allows SCP-2470 to refuse to perceive it (\"to close its eyes\", metaphorically speaking). However, the fact that this //modus operandi// remains its only manner of existence for \u2588 years in containment counts in favor of the paradox's adequacy and the proficiency of the developed neutralization procedure, which is based on a forceful inoculation of a destructive meme bypassing the object's senses.\n\n\n\n[INFORMATION IS REMOVED FROM PUBLIC ACCESS. DELETION PENDING. LEVEL 4 CLEARANCE IS REQUIRED TO CONTINUE] \n\n[[collapsible show=\"Enter validation code: [_\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0]\" hide=\"Enter validation code: [*******] \u2013 Access granted.\"]]\n\nAccording to another hypothesis, the idea of SCP-2470 being a cognizing entity is not quite correct, as a ZK-class scenario can leave behind neither any knowledge of the current existence, nor any entities possessing such knowledge. Actually, the origin of the effect resulting in a ZK-class scenario lies not within the object, as we got used to thinking, but within the whole outer world. It is not the object that tears fragments away from reality, but the reality itself discharging these fragments and casting them into the most fitting place -- into the unfillable unbeing that is SCP-2470 -- as soon as they form a strong enough causal connection with it.\n\n\n\nUnbeing, as the true nature of the object, originates as a result of every successful attempt to perceive it. Thus, as unbeing is a priori singular, part of the object manifests on the information medium or inside the perceiver's mind, destroying it directly. Under this hypothesis, this explains the above-referenced effects on perception.\n\n\n\nFrom this perspective the cognizing nature of the object appears to be merely an illusion, caused by its dualistic position relative to the \"forgetting\" nature of the universe, though a virtual cogniton[[footnote]]\u00aba cognoscitive quantum\u00bb, a quasiparticle, introduced in the theory of [REDACTED] as an elementary particle, a model mind mediator[[/footnote]] related to the object, created by this impact, appears to be indistinguishable from a real one (moreover, the concepts of \"real\" and \"objective\" appear to be conventional and hardly applicable in the given context). This is what determines the object's inability to perceive \u201cWei\u00dfschatten\u2019s paradox\u201d, but in this case it appears to be an objective and natural limitation, not related to a willed refusal to perceive. From this point of view the effectiveness of the developed neutralization procedure seems very dubious.\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n**Recovery Log:** The first report of the object's anomalous activity came on \u2588\u2588.\u2588\u2588.20\u2588\u2588 at about \u2588\u2588:00 from an airplane observer of FGU \u201cAvialesookhrana\u201d[[footnote]] a Russian government agency charged primarily with the aerial management of forest fires [[/footnote]], who was conducting fire safety monitoring in the [REDACTED] area. The pilot reported a huge deforested area centered around a wide, deep cavity. Communication with the pilot ceased soon afterwards. The report was intercepted by undercover Foundation agents in the MES and a reconnaissance operation with \u2588 mobile task forces was arranged.\n\n\n\nInitial hypotheses regarding the object's nature were defining it as something akin to a miniature black hole. However, primary analysis disproved this point of view and demonstrated the true nature of the anomaly. Several methods of containment and/or neutralization, such as [DATA EXPUNGED] had been applied unsuccessfully, and were followed by a proposal to use \u201cWei\u00dfschatten\u2019s paradox\u201d in order to neutralize the object. This attempt was a partial success. Neutralization was not achieved; however, it was discovered that the paradox\u2019s carrier was not susceptible to the object\u2019s effect, which allowed the Foundation to capture SCP-2470 after several unsuccessful attempts and to develop the current containment protocols. Total losses throughout the whole operation amount to \u2588\u2588\u2588 employees.\n\n\n\n> **Excerpt from Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's report:**\n\n> \n\n> There was a remarkable episode during one of the first attempts of neutralization, when, at the suggestion of agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, a mirror was placed within the object\u2019s field of view. It seemed logical that, after seeing its own reflection, the object would neutralize itself. However, though the other things reflected in the mirror were subjected to its effect to the full, the object itself did not undergo any changes. Instead, it destroyed the mirror, although this action took it 12 seconds more than it usually took for items of similar scale. Also, it is obvious that the object has not been self-destructing due to self-awareness for \u2588 years already. This can be rationalized by one of the following hypotheses:\n\n>\n\n> * the object is either able to apply its effects selectively or is passively non-susceptible to them;\n\n> * the object is either unable to perceive itself, or is avoiding that;\n\n> * the object itself is uncognizable; \n\n> * the cognizable nature of the object is actually the object itself; any sort of cognition results in the object's duplication, which equals to the object growing due to its indivisible nature.\n\n> \n\n> The last hypothesis [DATA EXPUNGED] for more precise control.\n\n\n\nAccording to the data gathered later on, a small village of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 which had been abandoned since at least the late 80s had been situated at the initial discovery site. However, a few years before the anomaly appeared, it had been occupied with members of an unidentified, radical pro-apocalyptic religious community. The evidence of their activity is sketchy and inconsistent, though it suggests that [DATA EXPUNGED].\n\n\n\n**Addendum 1:**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"The O5-\u2588\u2019s memorandum to Area-141 personnel\" hide=\"The transcript of O5-\u2588\u2019s message to the personnel of Area-141 (hide)\"]]\n\n> Dear colleagues!\n\n> After the command of Area-141 informed me of certain popular perceptions among your community, I saw it right to explain certain particularities regarding our policy on SCP-2470.\n\n> \n\n> Yes, this object is exactly as dangerous as you were told or, probably, even more. Thus far our only salvation was the fact that the embryonic state of its mind cannot comprehend many of the things we consider obvious: that air is not nothingness and exists not just when it feels a breeze, that Earth is a celestial body of a finite size, that the Sun is not a flat shining spot on the horizon, that people, despite how different they are, all represent humankind as a whole, and so on.\n\n> \n\n> Yes, it is essential to keep the object in complete isolation and to avert any transmission of the most insignificant information at any cost. It learns very fast and we can never be sure which grain of knowledge it lacks to be given a nudge to the ideas of space, time, infinity and universe.\n\n> \n\n> Yes, it is both difficult and dangerous to contain such an object, and yes, we do possess a procedure of its neutralization. Why are we not engaging it?\n\n> \n\n> The reason is because the containment itself is of a huge strategic value to us. The thing is, according to research on this subject, simultaneous occurrence of //two// ZK-class scenarios is fundamentally impossible. Therefore, as long as one of them is being contained, we guarantee that the others, which might not be so easily controlled anyhow, will not happen.\n\n> \n\n> In fact, we were very lucky that this object took a form that can be contained at acceptable cost, so it would not be sensible to lose such opportunity. Therefore, containment will be carried out as long as we can manage, with neutralization being planned only for such an extreme case when the object's direct threat will be big enough to negate all of our prospects of carrying this policy out in the future, along with the future itself.\n\n> \n\n> Through thick and thin you have to know that your work guarantees humanity's continued existence. Treat it properly.\n\n> \n\n> Secure. Contain. Protect.\n\n> \n\n> Sincerely yours, \u041e5-\u2588.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n**Addendum 2:**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"The list of enactors and the methodology for procedure of the object's neutralization\" hide=\"Hide\"]]\n\nThe procedure is to be performed by two (2) subjects possessing confirmed telepathic abilities rated at no less than 9 points on the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 scale, with a satisfactory result for 2470-qt spatial awareness test, no history of earlier exposure and no impairments (such as color-blindness) that affect visual and color perception. In case the list is down to 30 positions or fewer for whatever reason, use of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 for development of telepathic abilities in suitable candidates is authorized for the purpose of replenishing the list. As of today \u2588\u2588 individuals are on the list, namely:\n\n\n\n[DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n\n\nImmediately after protocol 2470-Beta is engaged, there is a preliminary measure that consists of building an additional shell according to the requirements for inner shell breach scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe executors must be kept in ignorance of the true purpose of the Area; a cover story of it being a telepathy research center and the process being a test of their abilities is to be adhered to. Additionally the subjects must not know about each other\u2019s existence; violation of this condition is grounds for immediate termination and a selection of new candidates.\n\n\n\nThe neutralization procedure is performed using an adapted version of \u201cWei\u00dfschatten\u2019s paradox\u201d, divided into two subcomponents, both safe to be perceived separately. The subjects\u2019 task is to memorize one of the subcomponents and to implant it synchronously into the mind of the entity, which is located in the center of the shell, demonstrated to them using live transmission. The active 2470-c telepathy suppression device is to be switched off five (5) seconds before the subjects are authorized to act, and should be kept offline for at least 15 but no more than 25 seconds. Trial runs for this procedure are conducted at the on-site training complex using a Class D test subject; at least three successful trial runs in succession are required before the performers are cleared for work. When taking part in the actual procedure, the subjects must not know it is not a trial run.\n\n\n\nAfter the procedure is performed, the first inspection is conducted by switching off the the inner shell power for 30 (thirty) minutes. In case the inner shell shows no change in its electrical performance and has no other signs of structural damage, the inspection is considered passed. The second inspection is conducted visually, by means of employees entering the central shell wearing protective suits with the spatial image filtration system turned off. If the procedure is successful, the shell should not have anything inside.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n**Addendum 3: document 2470-x.**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Medical staff only.\" hide=\"Hide\" hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n\n//This document is intended for the medical staff of Area 141 only. Divulgence of any details contained herein is to result in termination. Any other employee displaying knowledge of the contents of this document is to be (aside from an appropriate disciplinary action) treated with an A-class amnestic and transferred to another Foundation facility.//\n\n\n\nThe medical staff of Area 141 are to pay extra attention to psychological health assessment of employees during periodical personnel surveys. Aside from disorders that are natural for conditions of strenuous work, special effort must be put into discovering the following complex of symptoms:\n\n* repetitive dreams featuring an abstract pulsing and growing black mass, identified as SCP-2470 by the examinee;\n\n* total lack of any dreams soon thereafter (in less than a week);\n\n* flattening of affects, progressive indifference to surroundings, and reactions becoming mechanical;\n\n* repeating episodes in which the examinee looks at a common everyday object for a long time with an uncommon curiosity.\n\n\n\nA lack of any discernible dreams lasting for two weeks is considered a sufficient warrant for a suspension and quarantine assessment. The quarantine implicates a termination of any forms of communication with any personnel not involved in the process of assessment.\n\n\n\nTo ensure reliable diagnosis, a trust relationship with the personnel is to be set and maintained. It is recommended to present the practice of regular discussions of dreams as a preliminary phase of psychological survey, aimed at distraction from the current situation and relaxation. The keen interest in nightmares can be explained as a search for hidden reasons for nervousness and analysis of suppressed fears.\n\n\n\nThe aforementioned diagnosis should be given top priority for personnel involved in procedures taking place inside the containment volume and central shells, and especially for those who spent unscheduled time inside for whatever reasons. The latter are to be quarantined immediately and thoroughly examined for no less than two weeks. Everyone who spent more than an hour and a half inside the outer shell or more than an hour inside the inner shell are to be considered to fail the inspection, regardless of observed state.\n\n\n\nAll diagnosed cases are to be processed as soon as possible.

Further supplies of the substance were taken into custody at the warehouse.

More detailed analysis confirmed that there was no editing of the images (either by normal or anomalous means).\n\n\n\nThe MTF 9-Alice \"Tief in Reinekes Bau\"[[footnote]]EN: \"Deep in Reineke's Burrow\" [[/footnote]] was sent to the site. In the basement, the carcasses of beings resembling SCP-255-DE were found, except for the species. An hour later, SCP-255-DE was discovered in what was thought to be an aquarium and the subject surrendered to the care of the task force without resistance after a supposed misunderstanding was cleared up.\n\n\n\nOne bottle of AO-255-DE/A was already found in the object's possession.

it is considered impossible to retrieve all instances of SCP-262-IE-1 in civilian society. Because of this, the current focus of containment is to prevent the spread of SCP-262-IE-2 in civilian society. Foundation owned webcrawler \"Morrison's Jig\" is to monitor the internet and remove content referencing SCP-262-IE (especially SCP-262-IE-2). Upon discovery of such content, the uploader is to be located and Mobile Task Force \u00c9ire-4 \"Foxhunter's Reel\" is to be dispatched to the location to administer amnestics and retrieve SCP-262-IE-1. All retrieved instances are to be contained in Low-Threat Object Lockers in Site-35369, and assigned personnel are to analyze them using SCP-262-IE-2.</p>\n<h2><span><strong>Description</strong></span></h2>\n<p>SCP-262-IE is the general term for directed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology\" target=\"_blank\">topological</a> changes that autonomously occur in elongated flexible objects when not directly observed. Elongated flexible objects that have undergone these changes are designated SCP-262-IE-1.</p>\n<p>SCP-262-IE usually occurs at least 5 hours after external observation is lost. These elongated flexible objects (in the case where both ends are taken to be closed) automatically form non-trivial knots (one object) or tangles (two objects or more). SCP-262-IE-1's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_(mathematics)\">knots</a> have been determined to increase in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_number_(knot_theory)\">crossing number</a> in proportion to the amount of time unobserved.</p>\n<p>SCP-262-IE-2 is a method of extracting meaningful strings of text from SCP-262-IE-1 patterns. This method assigns a concept to each equivalent pattern in the knot, then decomposes SCP-262-IE-1 into prime knots and replaces each knot with its equivalent concept producing a sentence.</p>\n<p>SCP-262-IE-2 was initially established by Prof. Tuirtheacht \u00d3 hEidirsce\u00f3il at the National University of Ireland, who published it as the result of research at a university presentation. When the Foundation confirmed SCP-262-IE as anomalous and began containment of the object, SCP-262-IE-2's full contents had not yet been clarified. As such, Prof. \u00d3 hEidirsce\u00f3il and his sister Earraigh N\u00ed Eidirsce\u00f3il, who had also been undertaking the research, were consulted and both are now employed by the Foundation to research SCP-262-IE-2. In addition, all participants present at the presentation were administered Class-A amnestics.</p>\n<p>Information of SCP-262-IE-1 extracted via SCP-262-IE-2 generally relates to things the owners of or those related to SCP-262-IE-1 had forgotten or are only unconsciously aware of. Of note is that even memories removed using amnestics can be recalled via SCP-262-IE-1. As such, SCP-262-IE is a potential information leak, and can become a carrier for infohazards.</p>\n<h2><span><strong>Addendum 262-IE.01</strong></span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Interview log with Eidirsce\u00f3il siblings</strong></span></p>\n<p>The following is a record of an interview with the Eidirsce\u00f3il siblings during the initial stages of SCP-262-IE containment.</p>\n<div style=\"display: inline-block ; border : dashed 1px #444444 ; background :#F5F5F5 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : 95% ; padding:10px\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size:125%;\">Taifead den Agallamh #262-IE.01</span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:80%;\">Interview Log #262-IE.01</span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:80%;\"><strong>20\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588</strong></span></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Agalla\u00ed:</strong> Tuirtheacht \u00d3 hEidirsce\u00f3il, Earraigh N\u00ed Eidirsce\u00f3il<br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:80%;\"><strong>Interviewees:</strong> Tuirtheacht \u00d3 hEidirsce\u00f3il (T), Earraigh N\u00ed Eidirsce\u00f3il (E)</span></p>\n<p><strong>Agall\u00f3ir:</strong> Agt.

Tuirtheacht, Earraigh, could you tell me more about Code S\u00ecdh<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-385159-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-385159-2')\">2</a></sup>?</p>\n<p><strong>T:</strong> Of course. Well, we don't really have much to say. Well, I suppose it started like this - you've probably experienced it before, like when you leave your headphones in your pocket and they tangle up, or when you want to untangle a ball of yarn you've left out of sight for a while, but somehow can't.</p>\n<p><strong>C:</strong> Of course. In my case, there's a rule that says we have to wear our ID cards and pagers around our necks, but after a while the strap gets tangled and it's hard to untie it.</p>\n<p><strong>E:</strong> Our parents' house was a workshop where people worked with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%BAg%C3%A1n\" target=\"_blank\">s\u00fag\u00e1n</a><sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-385159-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-385159-3')\">3</a></sup>, and on rest days we'd have a lot to help out with. Even so, we started to notice once we left some materials somewhere and we'd come back to it all tangled, so that was how we started. And my brother taught topology in university\u2026 <em>(pauses for a moment)</em> Caoimhe, do you know what topology is?</p>\n<p><strong>C:</strong> <em>(shakes head)</em> \u2026 Unfortunately, it's out of my specialization.</p>\n<p><strong>T:</strong> Topology is the study of \"properties that hold after continuous deformation\". It sound complex, but I'll offer a simple example: a donut has one hole, and so it is topologically equivalent to a cup with a handle. Imagine the cup is made of unfired clay. If you push together the cup part and keep the handle, it looks like a weird-looking donut, doesn't it?</p>\n<p><strong>E:</strong> If I may offer an extreme example, the human body has the alimentary canal, which goes from the mouth to the anus, so it's also topologically equivalent to a donut.</p>\n<p><strong>T:</strong> Earraigh, how did you come up with that\u2026 well, it's roughly correct, anyway. Do you understand so far?</p>\n<p><strong>C:</strong> Yes, for the most part.</p>\n<p><strong>T:</strong> And in topology, there is a field that studies knots in rope. It's called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory\" target=\"_blank\">knot theory</a>. I'll leave out the details, but you can use this theory to determine \"which knots are topologically equivalent to one another\".</p>\n<p><strong>C:</strong> Uh huh?</p>\n<p><strong>T:</strong> Here's the important part\u2026 when we'd help out around the house, the s\u00fag\u00e1n we left tended to knot up in a topologically equivalent manner. And most of them had a large crossing number. If I may offer an example, with a crossing number of 15, there are 250,000 possible patterns. It can't be a coincidence that multiple of these \"random\" knots have the same pattern.</p>\n<p><strong>C:</strong> And because of that drawing your interest, you started to research it?</p>\n<p><strong>T:</strong> Yes. Although, initially we had no idea what we were doing. With no prior information, it was like we were trying to decode Linear A. The fact we managed to decode it at all was honestly a coincidence. One day, Earraigh said she couldn't find her book of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._B._Yeats\">Yeats'</a> works, and I came to help her find it.</p>\n<p><strong>E:</strong> It was a book I'd loaned from the library, and I'd just remembered it was overdue\u2026 so I hurried to find it. I couldn't find it in the study, or the room, so we looked for it all over the house. After a whole day, we found it in a corner of the basement\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>T:</strong> Oh, at the time, she was called to carry a bag of flour up from the storage room in the basement. Earraigh was holding the book at the time, so she'd probably left it there then\u2026 Anyway. After we'd found what we were looking for, we went to the library to return the book, then went home. When we went into the workshop to continue deciphering the knots. And then\u2026 the knots that had all been different had now formed themselves into the same pattern.</p>\n<p><strong>C:</strong> The same pattern?</p>\n<p><strong>T:</strong> Yes. As I said earlier, the chances that the knots were forming the same pattern out of pure chance is close to impossible. Now that I think about it, it was around sunset, and it was starting to get dark. A crow on the roof cawed, like it was announcing something, and then flew away. And in the midst of all that, knots with the same face were spread out all over the floor. That must have been eerie, but somehow\u2026 I felt it was calling out to me.</p>\n<p><strong>C:</strong> Calling out?</p>\n<p><strong>T:</strong> I can't put it into words, but\u2026 I had a feeling the knots, one by one, were calling out to me, trying to tell me something with all their might. I was crawling on the floor, scrawling a correspondence chart between the knots and sentences. A few days ago, the thoughts I'd had when Earraigh read the book. A few years ago, when I'd borrowed the same book from the library and read it. The sentences from the book that I'd memorized and then forgotten. That's what they were trying to tell me, and I somehow realized it\u2026 and that's how we started decoding.</p>\n<p><strong>C:</strong> \u2026 <em>(motioning for interviewees to continue)</em></p>\n<p><strong>T:</strong> But we haven't decoded all of it. The correspondence chart we have only has a few tens of lines. Even then, knots forming on their own to express memories\u2026 it's very strange, and it might even it might exceed science and pass right into the realm of the occult. Perhaps it could be a prank of the <span class=\"ruby\">fairies<span class=\"rt\">S\u00ecdhe</span></span>.</p>\n<p><strong>C:</strong> In fact\u2026 there is an organization that has offered to support your research\u2026</p>\n<p>[The following contents are of low importance and have been omitted]</p>\n<p>[End Recording]</p>\n</div>\n<h2><span><strong>Addendum 262-IE.02</strong></span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Decoded SCP-262-IE-1 (excerpt)</strong></span></p>\n<p>The following is an excerpt from SCP-262-IE-1 decoding logs.

Because of this, the current focus of containment is to prevent the spread of SCP-262-IE-2 in civilian society. Foundation owned webcrawler \"Morrison's Jig\" is to monitor the internet and remove content referencing SCP-262-IE (especially SCP-262-IE-2). Upon discovery of such content, the uploader is to be located and Mobile Task Force \u00c9ire-4 \"Foxhunter's Reel\" is to be dispatched to the location to administer amnestics and retrieve SCP-262-IE-1. All retrieved instances are to be contained in Low-Threat Object Lockers in Site-35369, and assigned personnel are to analyze them using SCP-262-IE-2.\n\n\n\n++ **Description**\n\n\n\nSCP-262-IE is the general term for directed [*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology topological] changes that autonomously occur in elongated flexible objects when not directly observed. Elongated flexible objects that have undergone these changes are designated SCP-262-IE-1. \n\n\n\nSCP-262-IE usually occurs at least 5 hours after external observation is lost. These elongated flexible objects (in the case where both ends are taken to be closed) automatically form non-trivial knots (one object) or tangles (two objects or more). SCP-262-IE-1's [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_(mathematics) knots] have been determined to increase in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_number_(knot_theory) crossing number] in proportion to the amount of time unobserved.\n\n\n\nSCP-262-IE-2 is a method of extracting meaningful strings of text from SCP-262-IE-1 patterns. This method assigns a concept to each equivalent pattern in the knot, then decomposes SCP-262-IE-1 into prime knots and replaces each knot with its equivalent concept producing a sentence. \n\n\n\nSCP-262-IE-2 was initially established by Prof. Tuirtheacht \u00d3 hEidirsce\u00f3il at the National University of Ireland, who published it as the result of research at a university presentation. When the Foundation confirmed SCP-262-IE as anomalous and began containment of the object, SCP-262-IE-2's full contents had not yet been clarified. As such, Prof. \u00d3 hEidirsce\u00f3il and his sister Earraigh N\u00ed Eidirsce\u00f3il, who had also been undertaking the research, were consulted and both are now employed by the Foundation to research SCP-262-IE-2. In addition, all participants present at the presentation were administered Class-A amnestics.\n\n\n\nInformation of SCP-262-IE-1 extracted via SCP-262-IE-2 generally relates to things the owners of or those related to SCP-262-IE-1 had forgotten or are only unconsciously aware of. Of note is that even memories removed using amnestics can be recalled via SCP-262-IE-1. As such, SCP-262-IE is a potential information leak, and can become a carrier for infohazards.\n\n\n\n++ **Addendum 262-IE.01**\n\n__**Interview log with Eidirsce\u00f3il siblings**__\n\n\n\nThe following is a record of an interview with the Eidirsce\u00f3il siblings during the initial stages of SCP-262-IE containment.\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block ; border : dashed 1px #444444 ; background :#F5F5F5 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : 95% ; padding:10px\"]]\n\n[[size 125%]]Taifead den Agallamh #262-IE.01[[/size]]\n\n[[size 80%]]Interview Log #262-IE.01[[/size]]\n\n[[size 80%]]**20\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588**[[/size]]\n\n-----\n\n**Agalla\u00ed:** Tuirtheacht \u00d3 hEidirsce\u00f3il, Earraigh N\u00ed Eidirsce\u00f3il\n\n[[size 80%]]**Interviewees:** Tuirtheacht \u00d3 hEidirsce\u00f3il (T), Earraigh N\u00ed Eidirsce\u00f3il (E)[[/size]]\n\n\n\n**Agall\u00f3ir:** Agt. Caoimhe Finn\n\n[[size 80%]]**Interviewer:** Agt. Caoimhe Finn (C) [[/size]]\n\n-----\n\n[Begin Recording]\n\n\n\n**C:** Let's begin the interview. Tuirtheacht, Earraigh, could you tell me more about Code S\u00ecdh[[footnote]]The name given to SCP-262-IE-2 by \u00d3 hEidirsce\u00f3il.[[/footnote]]?\n\n\n\n**T:** Of course. Well, we don't really have much to say. Well, I suppose it started like this - you've probably experienced it before, like when you leave your headphones in your pocket and they tangle up, or when you want to untangle a ball of yarn you've left out of sight for a while, but somehow can't.\n\n\n\n**C:** Of course. In my case, there's a rule that says we have to wear our ID cards and pagers around our necks, but after a while the strap gets tangled and it's hard to untie it.\n\n\n\n**E:** Our parents' house was a workshop where people worked with [*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%BAg%C3%A1n s\u00fag\u00e1n][[footnote]]Irish for straw-rope.[[/footnote]], and on rest days we'd have a lot to help out with. Even so, we started to notice once we left some materials somewhere and we'd come back to it all tangled, so that was how we started. And my brother taught topology in university... //(pauses for a moment)// Caoimhe, do you know what topology is?\n\n\n\n**C:** //(shakes head)// ... Unfortunately, it's out of my specialization.\n\n\n\n**T:** Topology is the study of \"properties that hold after continuous deformation\". It sound complex, but I'll offer a simple example: a donut has one hole, and so it is topologically equivalent to a cup with a handle. Imagine the cup is made of unfired clay. If you push together the cup part and keep the handle, it looks like a weird-looking donut, doesn't it?\n\n\n\n**E:** If I may offer an extreme example, the human body has the alimentary canal, which goes from the mouth to the anus, so it's also topologically equivalent to a donut.\n\n\n\n**T:** Earraigh, how did you come up with that... well, it's roughly correct, anyway. Do you understand so far?\n\n\n\n**C:** Yes, for the most part.\n\n\n\n**T:** And in topology, there is a field that studies knots in rope. It's called [*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory knot theory]. I'll leave out the details, but you can use this theory to determine \"which knots are topologically equivalent to one another\".\n\n\n\n**C:** Uh huh?\n\n\n\n**T:** Here's the important part... when we'd help out around the house, the s\u00fag\u00e1n we left tended to knot up in a topologically equivalent manner. And most of them had a large crossing number. If I may offer an example, with a crossing number of 15, there are 250,000 possible patterns. It can't be a coincidence that multiple of these \"random\" knots have the same pattern.\n\n\n\n**C:** And because of that drawing your interest, you started to research it?\n\n\n\n**T:** Yes. Although, initially we had no idea what we were doing. With no prior information, it was like we were trying to decode Linear A. The fact we managed to decode it at all was honestly a coincidence. One day, Earraigh said she couldn't find her book of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._B._Yeats Yeats'] works, and I came to help her find it.\n\n\n\n**E:** It was a book I'd loaned from the library, and I'd just remembered it was overdue... so I hurried to find it. I couldn't find it in the study, or the room, so we looked for it all over the house. After a whole day, we found it in a corner of the basement...\n\n\n\n**T:** Oh, at the time, she was called to carry a bag of flour up from the storage room in the basement. Earraigh was holding the book at the time, so she'd probably left it there then... Anyway. After we'd found what we were looking for, we went to the library to return the book, then went home. When we went into the workshop to continue deciphering the knots. And then... the knots that had all been different had now formed themselves into the same pattern.\n\n\n\n**C:** The same pattern?\n\n\n\n**T:** Yes. As I said earlier, the chances that the knots were forming the same pattern out of pure chance is close to impossible. Now that I think about it, it was around sunset, and it was starting to get dark. A crow on the roof cawed, like it was announcing something, and then flew away. And in the midst of all that, knots with the same face were spread out all over the floor. That must have been eerie, but somehow... I felt it was calling out to me. \n\n\n\n**C:** Calling out?\n\n\n\n**T:** I can't put it into words, but... I had a feeling the knots, one by one, were calling out to me, trying to tell me something with all their might. I was crawling on the floor, scrawling a correspondence chart between the knots and sentences. A few days ago, the thoughts I'd had when Earraigh read the book. A few years ago, when I'd borrowed the same book from the library and read it. The sentences from the book that I'd memorized and then forgotten. That's what they were trying to tell me, and I somehow realized it... and that's how we started decoding.\n\n\n\n**C:** ... //(motioning for interviewees to continue)//\n\n\n\n**T:** But we haven't decoded all of it. The correspondence chart we have only has a few tens of lines. Even then, knots forming on their own to express memories... it's very strange, and it might even it might exceed science and pass right into the realm of the occult. Perhaps it could be a prank of the [[span class=\"ruby\"]]fairies[[span class=\"rt\"]]S\u00ecdhe[[/span]][[/span]].\n\n\n\n**C:** In fact... there is an organization that has offered to support your research...\n\n\n\n[The following contents are of low importance and have been omitted]\n\n\n\n[End Recording]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n++ **Addendum 262-IE.02**\n\n__**Decoded SCP-262-IE-1 (excerpt)**__\n\n\n\nThe following is an excerpt from SCP-262-IE-1 decoding logs.

In order to investigate SCP-262-IE-a instances, [[[*http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-1970-jp| Hartmann]]]-Siochfhradha non-quantum interferometric spirit detectors are permitted to be used to examine the stored SCP-262-IE-1 instances. The relation of SCP-262-IE-a instances to [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/higashi-no-kamisama |various urban legends]]] is currently under investigation.\n\n\n\n++ **Description**\n\n\n\nSCP-262-IE is the general term for directed topological changes that autonomously occur in elongated flexible objects when not directly observed. The directionality of these changes manifest themselves primarily as a vector for returning personal thoughts to the noosphere[[footnote]]The collective sphere of thought of the human race. In this case, it refers to the collection of memories and knowledge amassed by the entire human race.[[/footnote]]. The action of SCP-262-IE can, for instance, return forgotten memories and knowledge. It is theorized that this phenomenon is a result of the storage properties of the noosphere.\n\n\n\nSCP-262-IE-a are Class-\u092a spirits[[footnote]]Spirit entities that can only be observed using non-interfering methods.[[/footnote]] theorized to be the source of SCP-262-IE. Based on observations using Hartmann-Siochfhradha non-quantum interferometric spirit detectors[[footnote]]Based on Hartmann spirit cameras, these devices indirectly observe spirits by excluding the object of observation from the observation range.[[/footnote]], SCP-262-IE-a typically emerge from humans or sapient organisms with similar intelligence to humans by a method similar to [*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astral_projection astral projection]. SCP-262-IE-a entities can be thought of as a residual thought that possesses \"forgotten information\" and as such induces small topological changes in its environment to preserve its information. As elongated flexible objects are topologically manipulable, they are particularly susceptible to SCP-262-IE-a influence, and therefore attract such instances. Objects affected by SCP-262-IE-a in this manner are designated SCP-262-IE-1. \n\n\n\nSCP-262-IE usually occurs at least 5 hours after external observation is lost. These elongated flexible objects (in the case where both ends are taken to be closed) automatically form non-trivial knots (one object) or tangles (two objects or more). As the amount of time unobserved increases, SCP-262-IE-1's complexity and therefore the amount of stored information increases exponentially. Current experimental results show that a single SCP-262-IE-1 left for five days can store up to 2.6 GB of data.\n\n\n\nSCP-262-IE-2 (commonly known as Code S\u00ecdh) is a method for reinterpreting information encoded in SCP-262-IE-1 as a natural language. This method assigns a concept to each equivalent pattern in the knot, then decomposes SCP-262-IE-1 into prime knots and replaces each knot with its equivalent concept producing a sentence in natural language.\n\n\n\nProject Kinea, which involves the creation of a large-scale high-speed recording medium using SCP-262-IE, is currently in proposal. This project is composed of two subprojects, \"Cuimhne\" and \"Caoineadh\" (both pronounced similarly to Kinea). The O5 Council is currently deliberating on whether or not to proceed. In addition, as Project Caoineadh involves ethical concerns, a parallel review by the Ethics Committee is also currently underway.

However, even if a large portion of the planned construction site is used, both standard and anomalous data storage devices are limited by storage capacity and write speed. As such, only extremely important information relating to civilization and technology are planned to be saved. As this information is incomplete, inconsistencies may arise that threaten the stability of the newly reconstructed civilization. For this reason, a method of storing all information about human civilization is desperately needed.\n\n\n\nThis project's goal is to use the noosphere's storage properties and the extension phenomenon that is SCP-262-IE as a form of storage for the Project Arca database, in order to create a lightweight but super-high-capacity rapid memory medium.\n\n\n\n**Project Description:** This project is based on the following components:\n\n\n\n**1. Carbon-Fiber Knot Induction Mechanism** (CODENAME: \"[[span class=\"ruby\"]]Casadh an tS\u00fag\u00e1in[[span class=\"rt\"]]Tangled Thread[[/span]][[/span]]\")\n\n\n\nA device that uses thin strands of carbon fiber stored in a space with low topological stability as a storage medium. In order to lower the topological stability of the space, the runaway state of the pseudo-Riemannian manifold creation device planned to be used in Project Arca can also be used. Following this, SCP-262-IE-a instances are to be lured to the space in order to induce SCP-262-IE-1 in the carbon fiber strands.\n\n\n\n**2. \u00d3 hEidirsce\u00f3il-Type Knot Tabulator** (CODENAME: \"[[span class=\"ruby\"]]Amhr\u00e1n Ois\u00edn[[span class=\"rt\"]]Song of Ois\u00edn[[/span]][[/span]]\")\n\n\n\nA device for identifying the knots that form in component 1. By inserting the carbon fiber into the probe needles in both directions, [*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reidemeister_move Reidemeister moves] are used to determine the individual positional relationships between fibers. In order to improve the precision of the results, optical sensors and thaumaturgical equivalence resonance sensors are attached in addition to the probe needles.\n\n\n\n**3. High-Speed Quantum Decryption Computer** (Codename: \"[[span class=\"ruby\"]]Cuimhne an Ph\u00edobaire[[span class=\"rt\"]]Piper's Memory[[/span]][[/span]]\")\n\n\n\nA system to convert patterns produced by component 2 into displayed readable information. In addition to the correspondence table for the already-determined Code S\u00ecdh, an artificial intelligence conscript (AIC) may be packaged in order to decode previously unencountered patterns. Currently, out of all usable AICs, [*http://scp-jp.wikidot.com/author:benjaminchong Cradle_Novos.aic] has been tentatively selected for its ability to command multiple languages.\n\n\n\nWith the above components, at the end of Project Arca's 5-day warmup period (the time needed to set up [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2000 Bright/Zartion Hominid Replicators (BZHR)]), 73.5% of human civilization's accumulated cultural and technological information can be saved. However, in order to further increase the percentage of saved data, ensure the safe and stable operation of the above project, and create a redundant system for the main database, it is thought to be necessary to create in parallel Project Arca-262-IE-C02 (\"Caoineadh\"), described in a separate proposal.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n++ **Addendum 262-IE.C-02**\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"background: url(http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat ; float: center; border: solid 2px #000000; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n\n[[>]]\n\n[[size 60%]]{{Faoi bhreithni\u00fa}}[[/size]]\n\n[[size 50%]]{{PENDING}}[[/size]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+ ##ff5c48|Togra Tionscadail Caoineadh (Sliocht)##\n\n+ [[size 60%]]##ff5c48|Project Caoineadh Proposal (Excerpt)##[[/size]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\n**Project #:** Arca-262-IE-C02 (\"[[span class=\"ruby\"]]Caoineadh[[span class=\"rt\"]]\"Elegy\"[[/span]][[/span]]\")\n\n\n\n**Project Objective:** In order to increase the percentage of data stored in the devices proposed in Project Arca-262-IE-C01 (\"Cuimhne\"), and to ensure the stability of the device, __it is considered necessary to activate the Ennui Protocol prior to the occurrence of the SD-Class \"Shutdown\" Scenario.__ This is due to the fact that unless a large proportion of the human population loses memories or life, the above proposed device cannot function properly. However, as 80% of the amnestics that will be available to the Foundation at the estimated time of the SD-Class Scenario are reserved for the implementation of the Ennui Protocol after civilizational reconstruction, there is clearly not enough supply to use the Ennui Protocol twice.\n\n\n\nThe goal of this project is to procure sufficient amnestics to use the Ennui Protocol before the SD-Class \"Shutdown\" Scenario, or to develop alternate means of amnesticization.\n\n\n\n**Project Description:** Currently, the main sources of amnestics known to the Foundation are [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3000 SCP-3000] and [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3171 SCP-3171]. Of those, the plan consists of somehow modifying SCP-3171 as a plant-based anomaly, and to convert it into a host for dispersing amnestics.\n\n\n\nCurrently, [[[*http://scp-int.wikidot.com/comeout-from-arca| the Japan Organisms Improvement and Creation Laboratory]]], which has been enlisted to assist in the creation of Project Arca, possess technology that can be used to achieve the aforementioned modifications. In addition, in the recent attack by the hostile group [[[*http://scp-int.wikidot.com/fixedflowers| Fixed Flowers]]], the [[[*http://scp-int.wikidot.com/early-summer-rain-on-arca| plant-based anomaly]]] used by the group has shown the ability to grow at rapid pace, and as such is considered of use to the project. The proposal thus includes raiding the organization and retrieving the relevant technology.\n\n\n\nConsidering these as the prerequisites, the following steps are to be taken to create a plant-based amnestic dispersal host in order to execute the Ennui Protocol:\n\n\n\n**1. Dispersal of Seeds** (Phase \"[[span class=\"ruby\"]]Saoirse[[span class=\"rt\"]]Freedom[[/span]][[/span]]\")\n\n\n\n24 hours prior to the occurrence of the SD-Class \"Shutdown\" Scenario, seeds of the plant-based amnestic dispersal host are to be distributed to all areas of the earth and planted. In addition to dispersal by airplane and other standard means, use of [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-514 SCP-514] and similar anomalies can be considered for conflict zones. Since the time for development, growth and dispersal of these hosts is limited, the technologies used by the two aformentioned groups are to be used to shorten the growth time, and only outdoor areas will be considered.\n\n\n\n**2. Drawing Out Targets** (Phase \"[[span class=\"ruby\"]]Samhradh[[span class=\"rt\"]]Summer[[/span]][[/span]]\")\n\n\n\nAs the dispersal targets are limited to outdoor areas, after the seeds have grown, the subjects of amnesticization are to be drawn out to the areas where the seeds have grown. As such, the flowers of the plant-based amnestic dispersal host are to be made visually appealing, and are to carry a certain degree of memetic effect. In addition, [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/lily-s-proposal some degree of weather control is to be added], in order to encourage the subjects to leave indoor areas and become exposed to the host.\n\n\n\n**3. Amnesticization** (Phase \"[[span class=\"ruby\"]]\u00c1thas[[span class=\"rt\"]]Joy[[/span]][[/span]]\")\n\n\n\nFollowing the drawing out of all subjects, the plant-based amnestic dispersal hosts are to begin scattering amnestics. In order to fully ensure the stable operation of Arca-262-IE-C01 (\"Cuimhne\"), __all memories and knowledge, save for basic instincts, shall be removed from the subjects.__ This constitutes an undignified end of humanity, and as such [[[*http://scp-int.wikidot.com/get-rid-of-the-veil| the Ethics Committee]]] must be consulted for approval.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"color: black; border: solid 1px #000000; background:#f2f2c2 url(http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; \"]]\n\n[[f<image http://scp-int.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-2626-jp/padlock.png]]\n\n+++ NOTE: Currently, Project Kinea is under consideration by the O5 Council and Ethics Committee.\n\n\n\n**While the deliberations are underway, this file has been temporarily locked from editing.**\n\n\n\n**As soon as the deliberations are complete, this file will be updated by the HMCL supervisor.**\n\n[[=]]\n\n**While we do not have much time, it is necessary to wait.**\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n< [[[scp-2626-jp|Return]]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n====\n\n--]\n", "references": ["scp-2626-jp#u-credit-view", "scp-8900-ex|", "scp-2626-jp/offset/1/page2_limit/1"], "scp": "SCP-2626-JP", "scp_number": 2626, "series": "international", "tags": ["_jp", "international", "media", "memory-affecting", "observational", "scp", "thaumiel"], "title": "SCP-2626-JP", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2626-jp"}, "SCP-280-JP": {"created_at": "2018-10-14T13:20:00", "creator": "INT_Translator", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "INT_Translator", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/int-translator", "comment": "Added tags: international, safe, scp, spacetime, sphere, temporal.

These claims have lasted since the object was contained by the Foundation in 1948 and the late arrival of the Coalition's forces on-site. However, given the diplomatic relations between the GOC and the Foundation, these pressures are so far not military in nature. In the event that this situation changes, the Bel Protocol must be initiated.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Regarding ORIA:</span> SCP-281-FR is currently at the heart of the Jihad of the Nine: a medium-scale military-religious conflict with the Office For The Reclamation of Islamic Artifacts of Iran, whose claim of SCP-281-FR was one of the founding objectives. Due to the significant geographical distance between the South Pole and ORIA bases, jihad operations against Local Site-Daoud are rare but significant, performed mainly using thaumaturgical means.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> Site-Daoud's isolated location within Zone-88 means that these Islamic operations are managed mainly by the GOC's armed forces.

These swords are comprised of various metals, with iron or bronze blades and handles of gold, silver, or copper including leather, traces of ivory, or precious stones. These swords are classified SCP-281-FR-1 to 9. All are planted approximately 15\u00a0cm in the ground at a single point, at the Earth's exact geographic South Pole (latitude: 90\u00b0 South, longitude: irrelevant).</p>\n<p>When SCP-281-FR was discovered on-site and reported to the SCP Foundation in October 1947, SCP-281-FR was accompanied by a sign reading:</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\">PLS<br/>\nTHANK YOU FOR NOT TOUCHING THE SWORDS</span><br/>\nUNDER PENALTY OF GIVING THE IMPRESSION THAT THE WORLD WAS DESTROYED<br/>\nWHICH WOULD WORRY A LOT OF PEOPLE OVER NOTHING<br/>\nSINCERELY YOURS<br/>\nSAPPHIRE</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>Officially, and especially in diplomatic relations with the Global Occult Coalition and its partner States, the Foundation has always respected this sign and has never attempted to take action on SCP-281-FR.</p>\n<p>Unofficially, all attempts to remove some or all of SCP-281-FR have ended in failure, whether by human, mechanical, or thaumaturgical means.</p>\n<p>All attempts were abandoned upon the discovery of several sensitive documents (see Addenda). It is assumed that SCP-281-FR is an essential element of the globe's geological structure, and that damaging its integrity could potentially cause the discontinuation of the terrestrial globe.</p>\n<p>SCP-281-FR's irremovability is due to an attractive force of several hundred million newtons of undetermined origin exerted by each of its components on the other components. This force of attraction does not seem to apply to objects other than SCP-281-FR's components.</p>\n<p>The Department of Theology proposed the hypothesis that each component of SCP-281-FR must have its own abnormal capability, which could manifest itself when each component is individually used as a weapon.

Apparently, among the 107 other organizations that were brought together in the Coalition, a large part of them were already aware of this optical effect.</p>\n<p>I began by thanking them, all of them, for having striven all this time to triumph the Truth of the Round Earth, and for having hidden from the world's population this unpleasant impression that the Earth is flat. It is very courageous of the New World Order to fight against a Singularity giving the impression to every human being that the Earth is flat, instead of imposing \u2014 sometimes by somewhat repressive means, certainly, but necessarily \u2014 the scientific evidence demonstrating that it is a globe.</p>\n<p>I was greeted by an awkward silence. A silence so deafening that I still have overdeveloped hearing, the opposite of tinnitus. For you see, the problem is that they themselves are convinced that the Earth is flat, and they believe they are lying to the world when they are actually telling the truth. You can imagine the discomfort in the ranks of the Council. The Bavarian Illuminati no longer knew where to stand and the Free-Masons pretended to look for lint on their ceremonial dresses.</p>\n<p>But either way, let's ignore that. Appearances are kept, that's what counts. I then asked them if SAPPHIRE had permission to fix this little aesthetic problem. Give back to the globe the appearance it should have.</p>\n<p>It was certainly the silence that followed that gave me my current anti-tinnitus.</p>\n<p>The assembly stayed to watch me, staring and silent, for something like a quarter of an hour before anyone dared to get up. I think they were in shock. The one who got up was, without much surprise, the Supreme Master Abraham of the Illuminati. I've never heard him stutter before, and I don't think anyone else has either.</p>\n<p>\"You\u2026 you want to make the Earth\u2026 round?\" he told me.</p>\n<p>You will understand that I had the sudden laziness to tell him that, no, the Earth was already round, and that we were just going to make it look the way it should. I decided instead to move directly into technical considerations.</p>\n<p>Hence my question: do you still have the nine swords of Muhammad in stock?</p>\n<p>With kind regards,<br/>\nPatrick Silverstein</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1946/11/16<br/>\nTo my very dear colleague Professor Patrick Silverstein<br/>\nHead of the Lodge of New York</p>\n<p>I confirm that we should be able to gather the swords of Muhammad. Singularities BRO-2562-ISL 2, 3, and 4 must have taken dust at the Lodge of Marseille; at last news, they were doing tests to verify that their attraction was indeed of magnetic origin and not unique. Unfortunately, it is, and no force manifests itself once in their sheaths. BRO-2562-ISL 7 is hidden somewhere in the Lodge of Cairo. I sent a letter to Professor Riegmann.</p>\n<p>As for BRO-2562-ISL 1, 5, 8, and 9, they were stolen by the Thule Society to serve the strange rituals of the Nazis, but were recovered during the Liberation and should now be stored in a crate lost in the Louvre's reserves; nothing that is unrecoverable.</p>\n<p>I'll put this all together and keep you more fully informed as things progress. We'll see you at the Inter-Lodge Summit anyway, won't we? You can then be able to share with us all the projects that are germinating in your mind.</p>\n<p>With kind regards,<br/>\nHerv\u00e9 Malesherbes</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Addendum 2:</strong> GoI-096-281-01 Archive Document</p>\n<p>The following document was recovered during a raid by Mobile Task Force Omega-5 (\"The Jewellers\") at the home of former Senior Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 on 1998/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588.</p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Show\u00a0document</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Hide\u00a0document</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Front</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Back</span></strong></p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Addendum 3:</strong> GOC-281-01 Archive Document</p>\n<p>The following document was taken from the archives of the Platform: a cutting-edge top-secret proto-informatics network implemented to enable members of the Council of 108, constituting the High Command of the Global Occult Coalition, to communicate remotely in real-time.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-4\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')\">4</a></sup></p>\n<p>A copy of these archives was provided to us by an anonymous informant, code-named \"Pinhead\", in 1999.</p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Show\u00a0document</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Hide\u00a0document</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sequence P12\u201322<br/>\nT: 14:56 | D: JAN-09</span></strong></p>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size:90%;\"><em>All the Pactisants of the New World Order have seen.</em><br/>\n<strong>The United Church of Satan</strong>, <strong>the Argentium Astrum</strong>, and 80 others validate.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content-panel standalone series\" style=\"background-color: #efefff;\">\n<p><strong>The Bavarian Illuminati</strong> appeal to the Pactisants of the New World Order.</p>\n<p>You have been heard, and your fears are legitimate.

Regular supplies must be provided by air.\n\n\n\nAll censorship and disinformation operations have been managed by the Global Occult Coalition since the 1950s. These operations include shifting the official South Pole 4 km from SCP-281-FR's location, and falsifying various kinds of information concerning the history of expeditions to Antarctica since 1911 and the fundamental geological and astronomical nature of the Earth.\n\n\n\n__Regarding the GOC:__ Local Site-Daoud is under regular pressure from the Global Occult Coalition, which is seeking to appropriate SCP-281-FR for security, strategical, political and/or religious reasons that are still unclear. These claims have lasted since the object was contained by the Foundation in 1948 and the late arrival of the Coalition's forces on-site. However, given the diplomatic relations between the GOC and the Foundation, these pressures are so far not military in nature. In the event that this situation changes, the Bel Protocol must be initiated.\n\n\n\n__Regarding ORIA:__ SCP-281-FR is currently at the heart of the Jihad of the Nine: a medium-scale military-religious conflict with the Office For The Reclamation of Islamic Artifacts of Iran, whose claim of SCP-281-FR was one of the founding objectives. Due to the significant geographical distance between the South Pole and ORIA bases, jihad operations against Local Site-Daoud are rare but significant, performed mainly using thaumaturgical means.[[footnote]]Which includes transport circles, //spell-eater// ammunition, and local deformations of reality.[[/footnote]] Site-Daoud's isolated location within Zone-88 means that these Islamic operations are managed mainly by the GOC's armed forces. In the event that this situation changes, the Ea Protocol must be initiated.\n\n\n\n__Regarding a K-Class Scenario:__ According to the founding Islamic texts, several of SCP-281-FR's components would be called upon to be recovered and used during Revelation-Type end-of-the-world events by Class-VII or higher Reality Manipulators. SCP-281-FR-5 is assumed to be recovered by the prophet Ali during the Last Judgment, whereas SCP-281-FR-1 is assumed to be recovered by the prophet Jesus to fight the Antichrist. In the event that this situation occurs, the Anu Protocol must be initiated.\n\n\n\nIn any case, it is assumed that removing one of the components of SCP-281-FR, or damaging its integrity, could cause an XK-Class event.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"History of the Daoud-Jalout Incidents\" hide=\"Hide history\"]][[/=]]\n\n\n\n[[<]]\n\n> **1952/04/17:** Definitive establishment of Zone-88 around Site-Daoud.

Colonel Emmerson denounces a terrorist act on behalf of the SCP Foundation in order to justify an armed intervention against Site-Daoud. False evidence is fabricated and presented to the GOC in order to make ORIA's guilt irrefutable.\n\n> \n\n> **1988/02/01:** Assassination of Colonel Emmerson.\n\n> \n\n> **1992/09/10:** Manifestation of a plot of arid desert occupied by an ORIA encampment 6 km from Zone-88.

Zone-88 is severely damaged and the Ea Protocol is initiated twice.\n\n> \n\n> **1994/09/13:** The spatiotemporal anomaly resolves itself. A retaliation operation from SAPPHIRE is suspected.\n\n> \n\n> **1999/04/28:** Several information leaks (see Addenda 2 and 3) concerning the nature of SCP-281-FR and the involvement of the GOC allow for the Foundation to blackmail several high-ranking members of the Coalition. The pressures of Zone-88 against Site-Daoud decrease.\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> **2005/03/22:** Emergence of an abnormally modified bomb through a transport circle within Zone-88. The bomb is defused in time. Shortly after, a dozen jihadists appear, shot dead without losses by the soldiers on-site who were waiting for them in ambush.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/<]]\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-281-FR is a set of nine swords of various shapes and sizes similar in style to the Arab weaponry of the late 7^^th^^ century CE. These swords are comprised of various metals, with iron or bronze blades and handles of gold, silver, or copper including leather, traces of ivory, or precious stones. These swords are classified SCP-281-FR-1 to 9. All are planted approximately 15 cm in the ground at a single point, at the Earth's exact geographic South Pole (latitude: 90\u00b0 South, longitude: irrelevant).\n\n\n\nWhen SCP-281-FR was discovered on-site and reported to the SCP Foundation in October 1947, SCP-281-FR was accompanied by a sign reading:\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n> [[size 150%]]PLS\n\n> THANK YOU FOR NOT TOUCHING THE SWORDS[[/size]]\n\n> UNDER PENALTY OF GIVING THE IMPRESSION THAT THE WORLD WAS DESTROYED\n\n> WHICH WOULD WORRY A LOT OF PEOPLE OVER NOTHING\n\n> SINCERELY YOURS\n\n> SAPPHIRE\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nOfficially, and especially in diplomatic relations with the Global Occult Coalition and its partner States, the Foundation has always respected this sign and has never attempted to take action on SCP-281-FR.\n\n\n\nUnofficially, all attempts to remove some or all of SCP-281-FR have ended in failure, whether by human, mechanical, or thaumaturgical means.\n\n\n\nAll attempts were abandoned upon the discovery of several sensitive documents (see Addenda). It is assumed that SCP-281-FR is an essential element of the globe's geological structure, and that damaging its integrity could potentially cause the discontinuation of the terrestrial globe.\n\n\n\nSCP-281-FR's irremovability is due to an attractive force of several hundred million newtons of undetermined origin exerted by each of its components on the other components. This force of attraction does not seem to apply to objects other than SCP-281-FR's components.\n\n\n\nThe Department of Theology proposed the hypothesis that each component of SCP-281-FR must have its own abnormal capability, which could manifest itself when each component is individually used as a weapon. This hypothesis cannot be proven because of SCP-281-FR's irremovability.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n**Addendum 1:** GoI-096-E46 Epistolary Documents\n\n\n\nThe following documents were taken from a letter exchange maintained in 1946 between Herv\u00e9 Malesherbes, former professor of applied mathematics at the Sorbonne University in Paris, and Patrick Silverstein, former consultant [DATA EXPUNGED], never found.\n\n\n\nThese letters were recovered during the dismantling of the Lodge of Paris in 2003 by Mobile Task Force Omega-5 (\"The Jewellers\").\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Show documents\" hide=\"Hide documents\"]]\n\n> 1946/02/14\n\n> To my very dear colleague Professor Herv\u00e9 Malesherbes\n\n> Head of the Lodge of Paris\n\n> \n\n> My Dear Friend,\n\n> I hope everything is going well for you, and that you do not have too many properties to rebuild in the Old Continent. I heard about your last operation, where the whole parish was put into orbit for a few minutes, just to properly show them that the Earth was round. Too bad they were brought back a little bit too late, but I'm sure they had the time to fully realize their mistake before they passed away. What better show than the Truth after all?\n\n> \n\n> We have the same kind of problem here, known as the Universal Zetetic Society:[[footnote]]Renamed to the \"Flat Earth Society\" in 1956, still active to this day.[[/footnote]] a bunch of retards who not only refuse to accept centuries of concrete and proven scientific evidence, but also claim to be zetetic and rational while doubting the official agencies, which they believe lie to them for personal gain! Imagine the image they give of real zetetic groups like us.\n\n> \n\n> Fortunately I have some good news, for the both of us, which is the subject of this entire letter: some colleagues working at NASA have assured me that thanks to Paperclip,[[footnote]]Operation Paperclip was a major exfiltration operation of former Nazi scientists in the USA, a significant part of which worked in the American aerospace sector.[[/footnote]] a V2 ballistic missile should be sent into the mesosphere for purely scientific purposes between now and the 24th of October. And it will be equipped with a camera! Finally, we will have photographic and indisputable evidence that the Earth is round, to be widely broadcast, an unstoppable means of popularization, which should eliminate the bad skeptics from the landscape. \n\n> \n\n> Tell me if you are interested, I will send you a copy of these photographs as soon as possible, so that SAPPHIRE's European lodges can have them ahead of all the media.\n\n> \n\n> With kind regards,\n\n> Patrick V. Silverstein\n\n\n\n\n\n> 1946/02/20\n\n> To my very dear colleague Professor Patrick Silverstein\n\n> Head of the Lodge of New York\n\n> \n\n> My Dear Friend,\n\n> I thank you warmly for so actively following -- and appreciating! -- the activities of the Lodge of Paris. The \"flatists\", as they say in the jargon, are definitely a plague. Skepticism must apply in the face of the Illogical, not the Logical; otherwise, it is little more than monstrous bigotry.\n\n> \n\n> SAPPHIRE members in France will gladly take your photographs of the Earth from above! The weight of words, the shock of photographs, isn't it? Fighting against the most harmful communities of Christianity, in particular, seems to me to be the priority at this time.

Apparently, among the 107 other organizations that were brought together in the Coalition, a large part of them were already aware of this optical effect.\n\n> \n\n> I began by thanking them, all of them, for having striven all this time to triumph the Truth of the Round Earth, and for having hidden from the world's population this unpleasant impression that the Earth is flat. It is very courageous of the New World Order to fight against a Singularity giving the impression to every human being that the Earth is flat, instead of imposing -- sometimes by somewhat repressive means, certainly, but necessarily -- the scientific evidence demonstrating that it is a globe.\n\n> \n\n> I was greeted by an awkward silence. A silence so deafening that I still have overdeveloped hearing, the opposite of tinnitus. For you see, the problem is that they themselves are convinced that the Earth is flat, and they believe they are lying to the world when they are actually telling the truth. You can imagine the discomfort in the ranks of the Council. The Bavarian Illuminati no longer knew where to stand and the Free-Masons pretended to look for lint on their ceremonial dresses.\n\n> \n\n> But either way, let's ignore that. Appearances are kept, that's what counts. I then asked them if SAPPHIRE had permission to fix this little aesthetic problem. Give back to the globe the appearance it should have.\n\n> \n\n> It was certainly the silence that followed that gave me my current anti-tinnitus.\n\n> \n\n> The assembly stayed to watch me, staring and silent, for something like a quarter of an hour before anyone dared to get up. I think they were in shock. The one who got up was, without much surprise, the Supreme Master Abraham of the Illuminati. I've never heard him stutter before, and I don't think anyone else has either.\n\n> \n\n> \"You... you want to make the Earth... round?\" he told me.\n\n> \n\n> You will understand that I had the sudden laziness to tell him that, no, the Earth was already round, and that we were just going to make it look the way it should. I decided instead to move directly into technical considerations.\n\n> \n\n> Hence my question: do you still have the nine swords of Muhammad in stock?\n\n> \n\n> With kind regards,\n\n> Patrick Silverstein\n\n\u00a0\n\n> 1946/11/16\n\n> To my very dear colleague Professor Patrick Silverstein\n\n> Head of the Lodge of New York\n\n> \n\n> I confirm that we should be able to gather the swords of Muhammad. Singularities BRO-2562-ISL 2, 3, and 4 must have taken dust at the Lodge of Marseille; at last news, they were doing tests to verify that their attraction was indeed of magnetic origin and not unique. Unfortunately, it is, and no force manifests itself once in their sheaths. BRO-2562-ISL 7 is hidden somewhere in the Lodge of Cairo. I sent a letter to Professor Riegmann.\n\n> \n\n> As for BRO-2562-ISL 1, 5, 8, and 9, they were stolen by the Thule Society to serve the strange rituals of the Nazis, but were recovered during the Liberation and should now be stored in a crate lost in the Louvre's reserves; nothing that is unrecoverable.\n\n> \n\n> I'll put this all together and keep you more fully informed as things progress. We'll see you at the Inter-Lodge Summit anyway, won't we? You can then be able to share with us all the projects that are germinating in your mind.\n\n> \n\n> With kind regards,\n\n> Herv\u00e9 Malesherbes\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n**Addendum 2:** GoI-096-281-01 Archive Document\n\n\n\nThe following document was recovered during a raid by Mobile Task Force Omega-5 (\"The Jewellers\") at the home of former Senior Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 on 1998/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Show document\" hide=\"Hide document\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n**__Front__**\n\n\n\n[[f=image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-281-fr/Galileo-Document.jpg]]\n\n\n\n**__Back__**\n\n\n\n[[f=image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-281-fr/Galileo-Document-2.jpg]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/collapsible]] \n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n**Addendum 3:** GOC-281-01 Archive Document\n\n\n\nThe following document was taken from the archives of the Platform: a cutting-edge top-secret proto-informatics network implemented to enable members of the Council of 108, constituting the High Command of the Global Occult Coalition, to communicate remotely in real-time.[[footnote]]Roughly comparable to a social network; 50 years ahead of its time, the existence of the Platform was only discovered in 1995.[[/footnote]]\n\n\n\nA copy of these archives was provided to us by an anonymous informant, code-named \"Pinhead\", in 1999.\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Show document\" hide=\"Hide document\"]]\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n**__Sequence P12\u201322 \n\nT: 14:56 | D: JAN-09__**\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n[[size 90%]]//All the Pactisants of the New World Order have seen.//\n\n**The United Church of Satan**, **the Argentium Astrum**, and 80 others validate.[[/size]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n[[div class=\"content-panel standalone series\" style=\"background-color: #efefff;\"]]\n\n**The Bavarian Illuminati** appeal to the Pactisants of the New World Order.\n\n\n\nYou have been heard, and your fears are legitimate.

MTF DE6-\ud835\udd08 (6-Emil \"Elmar Fudd\") is tasked with reviewing media reports and reports from medical facilities serving rural villages, settlements, and suburbs during the period after Easter Saturday, looking for reports that mention unexplained medical changes, especially if they involve sugary materials. Reports of unexplained, sudden stench should also be checked.</p>\n<p>If these reports confirm SCP-292-DE or SCP-292-DE-A activity, MTF responders shall be dispatched to the affected locations, take SCP-292-DE-A victims into custody, and seize all chocolate eggs in the location to eliminate possible confusion. The residents are to be treated with amnestics afterwards.</p>\n<p>Victims of SCP-292-DE-A, after consuming SCP-292-DE-A, shall be transported to the nearest base in quarantine for three days for observation, examination, and medical attention. After three days, depending on the nature of the physical alteration, the affected subjects will either be treated with amnestics and reintegrated back into society or transported as anomalous individuals to Site-DE17 for permanent containment. All witnesses and closer relatives of the affected subjects are then treated with amnestics.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> According to current research and witness reports, SCP-292-DE is a figure resembling a cuddly toy bunny made of dark gray burlap. The body parts are said to be sewn together with thick brown threads, and several places on the body are covered with colorful egg-shaped patches that are said to represent Easter eggs. On the face, it has a black and brown button eye on the left only, the right ear is partially torn off, and SCP-292-DE's mouth has been sewn shut. The size of SCP-292-DE varies between 20\u00a0cm and 2.30\u00a0m, depending on the testimony of the witnesses. If it is the same object or if there are further copies of SCP-292-DE is unknown at the moment.</p>\n<p>SCP-292-DE is capable of independent locomotion, preferring to move on its hind legs, although its stride is described as relatively staggering. When it is on its four paws, it can reach speeds of up to 80\u00a0km/h<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>, leap up three times its current body size, and even jump five times far to escape quickly in an emergency. SCP-292-DE possesses some degree of higher intelligence and probably some sort of precognition that it uses to sense potential danger.</p>\n<p>On the evening before Easter Sunday, SCP-292-DE appears near various rural settlements, villages or suburbs north of the 51st meridian in Germany, where Easter is celebrated. At which places SCP-292-DE appears is, according to current knowledge, arbitrary<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>During the evening before Easter Sunday, SCP-292-DE will materialize near its destination, where it will try to enter one of the gardens or houses on the outer edge of the settlement, where the tradition of the Easter egg hunt is celebrated.</p>\n<p>Once at the desired destination, it will tear open one of its patches and take out from it a copy of SCP-292-DE-A, which it will either hide directly on the spot or smuggle into an existing Easter nest. After successfully accomplishing this, it will hide behind the nearest larger plant<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup> hiding and dematerialized shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p>SCP-292-DE-A is a filled milk chocolate egg encased in plain aluminum. The color of the foil varies, as does the filling, which is contained in the chocolate. Visually, the eggs do not differ from conventional chocolate eggs. The general taste of SCP-292-DE-A has been described by concerned subjects as ordinary, even sometimes as bland or old.</p>\n<p>If SCP-292-DE-A are not found and consumed within three days, a strong odor reminiscent of rotten eggs develops, making the chocolate inedible. The odor intensifies until SCP-292-DE-A is either completely decomposed<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-4\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')\">4</a></sup> or it has been destroyed by combustion.</p>\n<p>The actual anomalous effect occurs after consumption of SCP-292-DE-A. Subjects who have consumed SCP-292-DE-A suffer a two-stage change in their body, depending on the flavor of the filling.</p>\n<p>Within the first hour, parts of the body insidiously begin to conform their structure or properties to the ingredients or properties of the added ingredients<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-5\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')\">5</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>Although this should usually be fatal for the affected subjects, bodily functions continue as usual and so far no deaths of affected subjects are known. However, these subjects find the changes unpleasant, psychologically distressing, frightening, and in some cases extremely painful. The first phase lasts about two days.</p>\n<p>On the third day after consumption, the second phase of changes begins. During this phase, the changes of the first phase dissolve, exposing the manipulated or new body part. This is completely healthy and even proves to be significantly improved in comparison to the condition that existed before the consumption of SCP-292-DE-A. In some cases, these are improved in ways that are impossible for normal people to achieve<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-6\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')\">6</a></sup>. Affected subjects feel more vital and better than before after completing the transformation. The effects of the second phase are so far permanent and irreversible.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Affected subjects, however, also feel strong aversion to chocolate and feel strong nausea in the immediate vicinity of it.</span> Affected subjects showed strong physical aversion to the filling they consumed, and the mere proximity of substances that remind them of it makes them feel strong nausea. Whether this permanent aversion to it is due to a psychological traumatic caused by the experience or whether it is part of the abnormal effects of SCP-292-DE-A is currently part of further research.</p>\n<p>Tests revealed that the initial aversion to chocolate was due to the fear that it might be filled with the filling they consumed<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-7\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')\">7</a></sup>.</p>\n<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> Reports about SCP-292-DE exist since 1946, but due to the remote location of its apparitions they were rather insufficient and could be confirmed only in 1967. SCP-292-DE-A came into the interest of the SCP Foundation in 1971, which listed the object as SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588-DE.</p>\n<p>For the next few years, researchers tried to find out how the objects got into the localities, but without significant success. It was not until 1990 that SCP-292-DE was accidentally captured by a private security camera placing an instance of SCP-292-DE-A into an existing Easter nest. SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588-DE was then reclassified as SCP-292-DE-A and merged with SCP-292-DE.</p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Summary\u00a0of\u00a0some\u00a0significant\u00a0SCP-292-DE\u00a0events</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">close\u00a0appendix</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p><strong>Summary of some more significant SCP-292-DE events</strong>.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Date:</strong> 04/15/1979.</p>\n<p><strong>Location:</strong> \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Saxony</p>\n<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Girl, 13 years old.</p>\n<p><strong>Involved filling:</strong> Cotton candy.</p>\n<p><strong>Progression Stage 1:</strong> Within a few minutes, the subject had first felt a tingling sensation in her gums, which increased more and more and later began to hurt severely. Within hours, the subject's teeth took on a crystalline shape, which turned out to be sugar crystals. These began to splinter more and more without outside interference, making the pain unbearable for the subject.</p>\n<p>Due to the fracture of the crystallized teeth, the subject bled profusely from the mouth, however, something seemed to prevent it from bleeding out. After all the teeth were destroyed after one day, the child felt painful pressure in her jaw bones pressing against the gums.</p>\n<p><strong>Result Stage 2:</strong> On the third day, new teeth grew back in the subject. The subject felt no pain and experienced a strong pleasant sensation in the mouth area, as well as strong hunger after starving for the previous two days. The teeth proved to be more resistant and stronger. This is made possible by an additional layer that coats the teeth and also protects them from dental diseases such as paradonthitis or caries. Attempts to take samples of the teeth and the layer on top failed because all dental equipment, including several dental drills and forceps, broke during the operation. The teeth remained undamaged.</p>\n<p><strong>Current Status:</strong> Subject and family were treated with amnestics. Subject was reintegrated into society as there was no acute threat to secrecy.

Despite an intensive search, the family could not find the source of the stench. The stench became stronger over the following days and continued to spread. Within three days, the family had to leave their house because the air was unbearable. A week later, the entire village was affected by the stench and had to be evacuated.</p>\n<p>The MTF sent to the site was able to find SCP-292-DE-A in a tree cavity of the apple tree located in the garden and destroy the object by incineration in a special container. A cover story about a faulty sewage system was developed as the reason for the stench. After reenacting restoration work, the residents were able to move back in a week later.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Date:</strong> 20.04.1990</p>\n<p><strong>Location:</strong> \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 near Berlin</p>\n<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Boy, 7 years old.</p>\n<p><strong>Indicated filling:</strong> Nougat</p>\n<p><strong>Progression Stage 1:</strong> Affected subject exhibited increasing abdominal and chest pain within half an hour of consumption, followed by severe nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The final product excreted in this manner had a different consistency and odor than usual. Upon closer examination, it was identified as liquid nougat. Investigations were able to prove the existence of abnormal intestinal bacteria which, for unknown reasons, convert the consumed food into nougat. Despite the severe physical discomfort and extreme change, the body itself showed no damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Result Stage 2:</strong> On the third day after consumption and complete emptying of the gastrointestinal tract, the boy felt completely healthy again. Examination of the intestinal tract showed a mutated version of intestinal bacteria that greatly improved digestion and showed regenerative properties on the intestinal tract.</p>\n<p><strong>Current Status:</strong> The family has been administered amnestics drugs.

Loss of physical coordination, nausea, vomiting, disorientation, strong urination and headaches followed. Blood tests revealed, in addition to traces of sugar and eggs, an alcohol level that would usually be lethal to the human body, but except for the typical symptoms of simple alcohol poisoning, the body showed no major effects. This condition lasted for two days.</p>\n<p><strong>Result Stage 2:</strong> After a severe hangover on the third day, the subject felt better than ever. Examinations of blood values as well as organs showed that the liver, kidneys and spleen were working much more effectively and filtering the blood better. As a result, the subject had developed immunity to toxins and other harmful substances affecting the blood, including alcohol. The subject no longer felt the intoxicating effects of alcohol or other intoxicants and painkillers. However, other drugs absorbed by the blood were also shown to be absolutely ineffective.</p>\n<p><strong>Current status:</strong> Due to his immunity to amnestics, the subject is in custody at location DE17.

The parents, unable to explain this, then drove the child to the nearest hospital.</p>\n<p>In the end, the subject could not move without some part of his body cracking and hurting.<br/>\nExaminations of the bones at the hospital revealed that they had been replaced with milky sugar crystals that broke when moved and grew back together within a few seconds.

However, before the Foundation could arrive and take the subject into custody, he escaped from his room and ran out of the clinic. On the street in front of the clinic, the subject was hit by an approaching ambulance. Despite the tremendous force that caught the subject, the subject suffered only shock and bruises and isolated abrasions.</p>\n<p>A subsequent examination revealed that the subject's bones were coated with an unknown layer that gave the bones additional stability and hardness without sacrificing flexibility.

On the day of the encounter, he was seven years old and living with his aunt and siblings in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Mecklenburg.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-12\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-12')\">12</a></sup></p>\n<p>According to his testimony, he would have kept it a secret until a few years ago, however, recently he often told his family and the residents and staff of the nursing home in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, where he currently lives, about his \"encounter with the Easter Bunny\". No one believed his tales and it was assumed that these were signs of dementia until Agent Sch\u00fcllers, who was at the home just to visit her mother, became aware of them. Agent Sch\u00fcllers, who works for MTF DE6-\ud835\udd08, became suspicious because the description of the \"Easter Bunny\" and the events that followed bore strong similarities to SCP-292-DE.</p>\n<p>With the approval of her supervisor and Dr. Heuyer, the principal investigator of SCP-292-DE, Agent Sch\u00fcllers took Mr. Mei\u00df's statement on April 21, 2019.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>\n<p>\"I remember that day as well as if it were only yesterday. Times were hard. The war had only been over for a short time. I came with my siblings to live with my aunt, my father was hauled off to the Soviet Union, and my mother died of an illness during the war.</p>\n<p>At that time we had to gather the remaining beets and cabbage in the sparse fields. The harvest was poor and most of it was confiscated by the Soviets. Times were really hard, we were hungry and we had nothing but destroyed fields, a ruin to live in and the torn clothes on our bodies. But we had the will to live.</p>\n<p>We knew it was Easter, but we gave up that we could look for colorful eggs like we used to. We didn't even have a chicken that could lay eggs, not to mention candy. And chocolate even less. We were lucky if we could survive the next winter, unlike my little sister Anne.</p>\n<p>Then, the night before Easter, I woke up. I had to get out and pee. We only had the outhouse outside. So I got up, quietly snuck out and went to the bathroom. After I was done, I heard a strange rustling noise from outside. I was afraid it was a wolf or a red. But at the same time, I had been very curious. So I opened the door just a little crack and carefully peeked out.</p>\n<p>There I saw him! In the light of the moon! Only a few meters away! The Easter Bunny himself, even if he looked quite different than I imagined him. More like an old cuddly toy than a real bunny. And the mouth, which was sewn up with him, was already creepy. But it was definitely the Easter Bunny! Never in my life will I forget him. Without ears he had been certainly as tall as I, with ears a head taller. The linen was almost white. Not quite, more like dirty snow. With eyes made of black buttons. And he walked on his thick little legs like a drunken Soviet.</p>\n<p>But the most striking thing was the big patch on his chest that looked like a colorful Easter egg! I knew then that it could only be the Easter Bunny! I watched him for a while and saw him pull off the patch and reach into his chest. He pulled out of it a dark egg, which he placed behind a tree stump.</p>\n<p>Then something apparently startled him. His gaze turned to me and he looked in my direction with his black beady eyes. I could still see him bringing his paw to his sewn-up mouth, as if to tell me not to say anything. Then he sat down on all four of his paws and\u2026WUSH! Like the wind he ran away!</p>\n<p>When he was gone, of course I ran to the tree stump where he had hidden the egg. But it was not a normal egg. It was made of chocolate! I ate it immediately. It was, for me, the sweetest and best thing I've ever eaten. And the last sweet thing.</p>\n<p>After I snuck back and went back to sleep, my heart had suddenly started pounding like crazy. It felt like it was about to burst out of my chest. I had only been able to breathe violently. I had felt dizzy all over. I had been sweating and hardly noticed anything afterwards. It was a blur. My chest had hurt. I wanted to scream, but I couldn't breathe. I saw everything blurry. I was so hot and nauseous. My vision was blurry for two days. I saw my aunt and my siblings looking at me worriedly. They were scared. I was scared.</p>\n<p>And I had been coughing. Over and over again. But it wasn't blood or saliva. It looked like\u2026 Like chocolate. Like melted chocolate. And it tasted like it. So brown, thick with little solid chunks. That taste that sticks in your mouth. The feeling of it sticking in your throat. How it felt like my chest was full of it and it was sticking everywhere. It was so disgusting to me. I will never forget it. Ever since then, just smelling chocolate makes me sick.</p>\n<p>But three days later, I woke up early in the morning. The taste and the feeling were gone. I was healthy! I was fine. I was feeling better than I had ever felt before! I could breathe in really deeply. The air was so fresh and delicious. My aunt had just come to visit us with the doctor, who lived three days away from here, but I was well again. The doctor had declared my aunt and me crazy and left again.</p>\n<p>Since then I had never had any problems with my breath. Never pneumonia, no cancer, even though I smoked like a chimney. Not even a cold had I ever had. I never had! I could breathe all the time, everywhere. I could run like the wind without the air burning inside me. And I could even hold my breath underwater indefinitely. So back when we were learning to swim, everyone called me \"fish.\"</p>\n<p>I kept it a secret for so long.

MTF DE6-\ud835\udd08 (6-Emil \"Elmar Fudd\") is tasked with reviewing media reports and reports from medical facilities serving rural villages, settlements, and suburbs during the period after Easter Saturday, looking for reports that mention unexplained medical changes, especially if they involve sugary materials. Reports of unexplained, sudden stench should also be checked.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nIf these reports confirm SCP-292-DE or SCP-292-DE-A activity, MTF responders shall be dispatched to the affected locations, take SCP-292-DE-A victims into custody, and seize all chocolate eggs in the location to eliminate possible confusion. The residents are to be treated with amnestics afterwards. \n\n\n\nVictims of SCP-292-DE-A, after consuming SCP-292-DE-A, shall be transported to the nearest base in quarantine for three days for observation, examination, and medical attention. After three days, depending on the nature of the physical alteration, the affected subjects will either be treated with amnestics and reintegrated back into society or transported as anomalous individuals to Site-DE17 for permanent containment. All witnesses and closer relatives of the affected subjects are then treated with amnestics.\n\n\n\n**Description:** According to current research and witness reports, SCP-292-DE is a figure resembling a cuddly toy bunny made of dark gray burlap. The body parts are said to be sewn together with thick brown threads, and several places on the body are covered with colorful egg-shaped patches that are said to represent Easter eggs. On the face, it has a black and brown button eye on the left only, the right ear is partially torn off, and SCP-292-DE's mouth has been sewn shut. The size of SCP-292-DE varies between 20 cm and 2.30 m, depending on the testimony of the witnesses. If it is the same object or if there are further copies of SCP-292-DE is unknown at the moment.\n\n\n\nSCP-292-DE is capable of independent locomotion, preferring to move on its hind legs, although its stride is described as relatively staggering. When it is on its four paws, it can reach speeds of up to 80 km/h[[footnote]]The top speed of a field hare.[[/footnote]], leap up three times its current body size, and even jump five times far to escape quickly in an emergency. SCP-292-DE possesses some degree of higher intelligence and probably some sort of precognition that it uses to sense potential danger. \n\n\n\nOn the evening before Easter Sunday, SCP-292-DE appears near various rural settlements, villages or suburbs north of the 51st meridian in Germany, where Easter is celebrated. At which places SCP-292-DE appears is, according to current knowledge, arbitrary[[footnote]]Current research aims to identify possible appearance patterns.[[/footnote]].\n\n\n\nDuring the evening before Easter Sunday,\u00a0\u00a0SCP-292-DE will materialize near its destination, where it will try to enter one of the gardens or houses on the outer edge of the settlement, where the tradition of the Easter egg hunt is celebrated. \n\n\n\nOnce at the desired destination, it will tear open one of its patches and take out from it a copy of SCP-292-DE-A, which it will either hide directly on the spot or smuggle into an existing Easter nest. After successfully accomplishing this, it will hide behind the nearest larger plant[[footnote]] Usually a tree or shrubbery, but in one case it hid behind a pot of a larger yukka palm. [[/footnote]] hiding and dematerialized shortly thereafter.\n\n\n\nSCP-292-DE-A is a filled milk chocolate egg encased in plain aluminum. The color of the foil varies, as does the filling, which is contained in the chocolate. Visually, the eggs do not differ from conventional chocolate eggs. The general taste of SCP-292-DE-A has been described by concerned subjects as ordinary, even sometimes as bland or old.\n\n\n\nIf SCP-292-DE-A are not found and consumed within three days, a strong odor reminiscent of rotten eggs develops, making the chocolate inedible. The odor intensifies until SCP-292-DE-A is either completely decomposed[[footnote]]Which can take up to three months.[[/footnote]] or it has been destroyed by combustion.\n\n\n\nThe actual anomalous effect occurs after consumption of SCP-292-DE-A. Subjects who have consumed SCP-292-DE-A suffer a two-stage change in their body, depending on the flavor of the filling.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nWithin the first hour, parts of the body insidiously begin to conform their structure or properties to the ingredients or properties of the added ingredients[[footnote]]Such as bony structures changing to sugar crystalline.[[/footnote]].\n\n\n\nAlthough this should usually be fatal for the affected subjects, bodily functions continue as usual and so far no deaths of affected subjects are known. However, these subjects find the changes unpleasant, psychologically distressing, frightening, and in some cases extremely painful. The first phase lasts about two days.\n\n\n\nOn the third day after consumption, the second phase of changes begins. During this phase, the changes of the first phase dissolve, exposing the manipulated or new body part. This is completely healthy and even proves to be significantly improved in comparison to the condition that existed before the consumption of SCP-292-DE-A. In some cases, these are improved in ways that are impossible for normal people to achieve[[footnote]]See the attached logs for details on this.[[/footnote]]. Affected subjects feel more vital and better than before after completing the transformation. The effects of the second phase are so far permanent and irreversible. \n\n\n\n--Affected subjects, however, also feel strong aversion to chocolate and feel strong nausea in the immediate vicinity of it.-- Affected subjects showed strong physical aversion to the filling they consumed, and the mere proximity of substances that remind them of it makes them feel strong nausea. Whether this permanent aversion to it is due to a psychological traumatic caused by the experience or whether it is part of the abnormal effects of SCP-292-DE-A is currently part of further research. \n\n\n\nTests revealed that the initial aversion to chocolate was due to the fear that it might be filled with the filling they consumed [[footnote]]This phobia can be cured after intensive psychological care, so that the affected subjects still found chocolate disgusting but could consume it again as long as it was not filled with the substance that reminded them of the filling.[[/footnote]].\n\n\n\n**Discovery:** Reports about SCP-292-DE exist since 1946, but due to the remote location of its apparitions they were rather insufficient and could be confirmed only in 1967. SCP-292-DE-A came into the interest of the SCP Foundation in 1971, which listed the object as SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588-DE.\n\n\n\nFor the next few years, researchers tried to find out how the objects got into the localities, but without significant success. It was not until 1990 that SCP-292-DE was accidentally captured by a private security camera placing an instance of SCP-292-DE-A into an existing Easter nest. SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588-DE was then reclassified as SCP-292-DE-A and merged with SCP-292-DE.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Summary of some significant SCP-292-DE events\" hide=\"close appendix\"]]\n\n\n\n**Summary of some more significant SCP-292-DE events**.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Date:** 04/15/1979.\n\n\n\n**Location:** \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Saxony\n\n\n\n**Subject:** Girl, 13 years old.\n\n\n\n**Involved filling:** Cotton candy.\n\n\n\n**Progression Stage 1:** Within a few minutes, the subject had first felt a tingling sensation in her gums, which increased more and more and later began to hurt severely. Within hours, the subject's teeth took on a crystalline shape, which turned out to be sugar crystals. These began to splinter more and more without outside interference, making the pain unbearable for the subject. \n\n\n\nDue to the fracture of the crystallized teeth, the subject bled profusely from the mouth, however, something seemed to prevent it from bleeding out. After all the teeth were destroyed after one day, the child felt painful pressure in her jaw bones pressing against the gums.\n\n\n\n**Result Stage 2:** On the third day, new teeth grew back in the subject. The subject felt no pain and experienced a strong pleasant sensation in the mouth area, as well as strong hunger after starving for the previous two days. The teeth proved to be more resistant and stronger. This is made possible by an additional layer that coats the teeth and also protects them from dental diseases such as paradonthitis or caries. Attempts to take samples of the teeth and the layer on top failed because all dental equipment, including several dental drills and forceps, broke during the operation. The teeth remained undamaged. \n\n\n\n**Current Status:** Subject and family were treated with amnestics. Subject was reintegrated into society as there was no acute threat to secrecy. Semiannual dental examinations are performed by a physician who works undercover for the Foundation.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Date:** 04/21/1981\n\n\n\n**Location:** \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Brandenburg, Germany\n\n\n\n**Subject:** SCP-292-DE-A was not consumed in time.\n\n\n\n**Indicated filling:** Not available, subject was found after the expiration date of SCP-292-DE-A.\n\n\n\n**Result:** A strong smell of rotten eggs had formed in the garden of the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 family. Despite an intensive search, the family could not find the source of the stench. The stench became stronger over the following days and continued to spread. Within three days, the family had to leave their house because the air was unbearable. A week later, the entire village was affected by the stench and had to be evacuated. \n\n\n\nThe MTF sent to the site was able to find SCP-292-DE-A in a tree cavity of the apple tree located in the garden and destroy the object by incineration in a special container. A cover story about a faulty sewage system was developed as the reason for the stench. After reenacting restoration work, the residents were able to move back in a week later.\n\n>\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n>\n\n**Date:** 20.04.1990\n\n\n\n**Location:** \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 near Berlin\n\n\n\n**Subject:** Boy, 7 years old. \n\n\n\n**Indicated filling:** Nougat\n\n\n\n**Progression Stage 1:** Affected subject exhibited increasing abdominal and chest pain within half an hour of consumption, followed by severe nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The final product excreted in this manner had a different consistency and odor than usual. Upon closer examination, it was identified as liquid nougat. Investigations were able to prove the existence of abnormal intestinal bacteria which, for unknown reasons, convert the consumed food into nougat. Despite the severe physical discomfort and extreme change, the body itself showed no damage.\n\n\n\n**Result Stage 2:** On the third day after consumption and complete emptying of the gastrointestinal tract, the boy felt completely healthy again. Examination of the intestinal tract showed a mutated version of intestinal bacteria that greatly improved digestion and showed regenerative properties on the intestinal tract. \n\n\n\n**Current Status:** The family has been administered amnestics drugs. The subject is examined twice a year by a country doctor who works undercover for the Foundation.\n\n\n\n**Special feature:** A security camera recorded SCP-292-DE hiding SCP-292-DE-A in an Easter nest for the first time. It was thus confirmed that the two objects were related. The recordings were confiscated.\n\n>\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n>\n\n**Date:** 04.04.1999\n\n\n\n**Location:** \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany\n\n\n\n**Subject:** Adult male, 43[[footnote]]He had taken SCP-292-DE-A from his son after discovering that it contained alcohol. [[/footnote]]\n\n\n\n**Indicated filling:** Eggnog.\n\n\n\n**Progression Stage 1:** The subject showed initial signs of drunkenness such as increased self-esteem, lowered inhibitions, and increased aggressiveness [[footnote]] within half an hour. He allegedly made sexual overtures to his wife and sister-in-law during Easter and verbally assaulted his brother-in-law and stepfather.[[/footnote]], dizziness, unclear slurred speech, and a euphoric mood.[[footnote]]He later stated that the chocolate egg had been the only alcoholic thing he consumed that day.[[/footnote]]. \n\n\n\nAs the day progressed, the symptoms worsened. Loss of physical coordination, nausea, vomiting, disorientation, strong urination and headaches followed. Blood tests revealed, in addition to traces of sugar and eggs, an alcohol level that would usually be lethal to the human body, but except for the typical symptoms of simple alcohol poisoning, the body showed no major effects. This condition lasted for two days.\n\n\n\n**Result Stage 2:** After a severe hangover on the third day, the subject felt better than ever. Examinations of blood values as well as organs showed that the liver, kidneys and spleen were working much more effectively and filtering the blood better. As a result, the subject had developed immunity to toxins and other harmful substances affecting the blood, including alcohol. The subject no longer felt the intoxicating effects of alcohol or other intoxicants and painkillers. However, other drugs absorbed by the blood were also shown to be absolutely ineffective.\n\n\n\n**Current status:** Due to his immunity to amnestics, the subject is in custody at location DE17. As a cover story, an affair was mentioned with which he would have secretly eloped.\n\n\n\n>\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n>\n\n**Date:** 04/16/2017\n\n\n\n**Location:** \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, near Bremen\n\n\n\n**Subject:** Boy, 10 years.\n\n\n\n**Indicated filling:** White milk cream.\n\n\n\n**Progression Stage 1:** Within half an hour, the subject became aware of cracking sounds in his fingers, which slowly but steadily continued to spread, causing severe pain. As the day progressed, the pain continued to spread with each movement and the cracking sounds increased in intensity. The limbs would bend in an unnatural way and shortly thereafter become stiff again. The parents, unable to explain this, then drove the child to the nearest hospital. \n\n\n\nIn the end, the subject could not move without some part of his body cracking and hurting. \n\nExaminations of the bones at the hospital revealed that they had been replaced with milky sugar crystals that broke when moved and grew back together within a few seconds. Despite the theoretical resulting damage, the remaining parts of the body remained undamaged for unknown reasons. \n\n\n\n**Result Stage 2:** By the third day, the subject's body had returned to normal. However, before the Foundation could arrive and take the subject into custody, he escaped from his room and ran out of the clinic. On the street in front of the clinic, the subject was hit by an approaching ambulance. Despite the tremendous force that caught the subject, the subject suffered only shock and bruises and isolated abrasions. \n\n\n\nA subsequent examination revealed that the subject's bones were coated with an unknown layer that gave the bones additional stability and hardness without sacrificing flexibility. It was even found that this layer could regenerate damage to the bones within seconds.[[footnote]]The subject, however, experienced an increased appetite for milk and dairy products as well as other potassium-containing products in return. [[/footnote]] \n\n\n\n**Current Status:** Subject was taken to site-DE17. Parents were administered an amnestics and told a cover story that their child died from undetected internal bleeding sustained in the accident. \n\n\n\nAt the time of this writing, the subject is being counseled as to whether his abnormal characteristics and athletic talent would make him suitable for intra-foundation training and later assignment to a mobile task force.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Audio-Log SCP-292-DE\" hide=\"Close attachment\"]]\n\n**Audio-Log SCP-292-DE**\n\n\n\n**Foreword:** The audiolog contains the testimony of Egon Meiss, a witness who, according to his own testimony, was the first to make eye contact with SCP-292-DE and the first to consume a copy of SCP-292-DE-A on April 21, 1946. On the day of the encounter, he was seven years old and living with his aunt and siblings in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Mecklenburg.[[footnote]] The village was dissolved in the 1980s and is now a closed-off area.[[/footnote]] \n\n\n\nAccording to his testimony, he would have kept it a secret until a few years ago, however, recently he often told his family and the residents and staff of the nursing home in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, where he currently lives, about his \"encounter with the Easter Bunny\". No one believed his tales and it was assumed that these were signs of dementia until Agent Sch\u00fcllers, who was at the home just to visit her mother, became aware of them. Agent Sch\u00fcllers, who works for MTF DE6-\ud835\udd08, became suspicious because the description of the \"Easter Bunny\" and the events that followed bore strong similarities to SCP-292-DE. \n\n\n\nWith the approval of her supervisor and Dr. Heuyer, the principal investigator of SCP-292-DE, Agent Sch\u00fcllers took Mr. Mei\u00df's statement on April 21, 2019. \n\n\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**<Begin Log>**\n\n\n\n\"I remember that day as well as if it were only yesterday. Times were hard. The war had only been over for a short time. I came with my siblings to live with my aunt, my father was hauled off to the Soviet Union, and my mother died of an illness during the war. \n\n\n\nAt that time we had to gather the remaining beets and cabbage in the sparse fields. The harvest was poor and most of it was confiscated by the Soviets. Times were really hard, we were hungry and we had nothing but destroyed fields, a ruin to live in and the torn clothes on our bodies. But we had the will to live.\n\n\n\nWe knew it was Easter, but we gave up that we could look for colorful eggs like we used to. We didn't even have a chicken that could lay eggs, not to mention candy. And chocolate even less. We were lucky if we could survive the next winter, unlike my little sister Anne.\n\n\n\nThen, the night before Easter, I woke up. I had to get out and pee. We only had the outhouse outside. So I got up, quietly snuck out and went to the bathroom. After I was done, I heard a strange rustling noise from outside. I was afraid it was a wolf or a red. But at the same time, I had been very curious. So I opened the door just a little crack and carefully peeked out.\n\n\n\nThere I saw him! In the light of the moon! Only a few meters away! The Easter Bunny himself, even if he looked quite different than I imagined him. More like an old cuddly toy than a real bunny. And the mouth, which was sewn up with him, was already creepy. But it was definitely the Easter Bunny! Never in my life will I forget him. Without ears he had been certainly as tall as I, with ears a head taller. The linen was almost white. Not quite, more like dirty snow. With eyes made of black buttons. And he walked on his thick little legs like a drunken Soviet. \n\n\n\nBut the most striking thing was the big patch on his chest that looked like a colorful Easter egg! I knew then that it could only be the Easter Bunny! I watched him for a while and saw him pull off the patch and reach into his chest. He pulled out of it a dark egg, which he placed behind a tree stump. \n\n\n\nThen something apparently startled him. His gaze turned to me and he looked in my direction with his black beady eyes. I could still see him bringing his paw to his sewn-up mouth, as if to tell me not to say anything. Then he sat down on all four of his paws and...WUSH! Like the wind he ran away!\n\n\n\nWhen he was gone, of course I ran to the tree stump where he had hidden the egg. But it was not a normal egg. It was made of chocolate! I ate it immediately. It was, for me, the sweetest and best thing I've ever eaten. And the last sweet thing.\n\n\n\nAfter I snuck back and went back to sleep, my heart had suddenly started pounding like crazy. It felt like it was about to burst out of my chest. I had only been able to breathe violently. I had felt dizzy all over. I had been sweating and hardly noticed anything afterwards. It was a blur. My chest had hurt. I wanted to scream, but I couldn't breathe. I saw everything blurry. I was so hot and nauseous. My vision was blurry for two days. I saw my aunt and my siblings looking at me worriedly. They were scared. I was scared.\n\n\n\nAnd I had been coughing. Over and over again. But it wasn't blood or saliva. It looked like... Like chocolate. Like melted chocolate. And it tasted like it. So brown, thick with little solid chunks. That taste that sticks in your mouth. The feeling of it sticking in your throat. How it felt like my chest was full of it and it was sticking everywhere. It was so disgusting to me. I will never forget it. Ever since then, just smelling chocolate makes me sick. \n\n\n\nBut three days later, I woke up early in the morning. The taste and the feeling were gone. I was healthy! I was fine. I was feeling better than I had ever felt before! I could breathe in really deeply. The air was so fresh and delicious. My aunt had just come to visit us with the doctor, who lived three days away from here, but I was well again. The doctor had declared my aunt and me crazy and left again. \n\n\n\nSince then I had never had any problems with my breath. Never pneumonia, no cancer, even though I smoked like a chimney. Not even a cold had I ever had. I never had! I could breathe all the time, everywhere. I could run like the wind without the air burning inside me. And I could even hold my breath underwater indefinitely. So back when we were learning to swim, everyone called me \"fish.\" \n\n\n\nI kept it a secret for so long. Nobody would have believed me anyway, not even my son, daughter or grandchildren. \n\n\n\nBut it was so long ago. And I realize that my memories are slowly fading. But I will never be able to forget the Easter Bunny. Even though he had caused the worst time of my life, maybe he had also saved my life. \n\n\n\nIf I could have one more wish.... \n\n\n\nI would thank him...\"\n\n\n\n**<End Log>**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n\n\n**Addendum:** Medical examinations made on Mr. Meiss following the interview confirmed abnormal efficiency of both lungs and all parts of the body responsible for breathing. Among other things, he had been able to hold his breath for up to 30 minutes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nHowever, since it would not have been possible to transport him unharmed to site DE17 due to his residual physical infirmities, it was decided, in consultation with Dr. Heuyer and the Ethics Committee, to leave Mr. Meiss at his current location.

Area-81JH Intelligence Division is to monitor for intrusions into lower narrative levels and prevent them when detected.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2955-JP is a humanoid anomaly of variable appearance manifesting during tests with <a href=\"http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-2650-jp\">SCP-2650-JP</a>. The anomaly affects human subjects who have been transferred from the universe in which this report was created (hereafter referred to as the base universe) into a lower narrative level, primarily through the anomalous effects of SCP-2650-JP. These subjects are altered to have the appearance consistent with that of the characters within the lower narrative level. This transformation consists of not only appearance but the physical structure of the subject's body and clothes. Behavioral changes have also been observed. In addition, it has been reported that affected individuals gain the abilities ascribed to the character they resemble, such as immortality and abilities that contravene the laws of physics, which have been classified under subspecies thaumaturgy.</p>\n<p>SCP-2955-JP's anomalous properties occur when a subject has been transferred from the base universe into the lower narrative level, which is then altered in some way. Initially, the Foundation had only speculative information about SCP-2955-JP. However, this report has been prepared based on cases observed by the Foundation, as well as several cases that were subsequently confirmed. For further information, please refer to SCP-2650-JP Experiment Log 2650-66.</p>\n<div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#f0f8ff; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Experiment Log 2650-66 - \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> D-4505 was provided with photography equipment and 8 years' worth of life-sustaining supplements, and disappeared along with SCP-2650-JP, with the aim of procuring information when D-4505 returned in some form.</p>\n<p><strong>Result:</strong> After approximately 1 year, SCP-2650-JP was recovered, containing an object thought to be the body of D-4505. SCP-2650-JP also contained the photography equipment supplied to D-4505, from which video material has been successfully retrieved.</p>\n<p>D-4505 had acquired immortality during its disappearance, and recovered from its dead state a few minutes after opening SCP-2650-JP. However, its external appearance differed significantly from its previous appearance, instead resembling \"Remilia Scarlet\", a character from the <em>Touhou Project</em> series<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>The recovered photography equipment shows D-4505 transforming into Remilia Scarlet while standing on what appears to be the roof of a building. In addition, a few days after the transformation, D-4505 appeared again on the rooftop, and was irradiated with visible heat rays by an unidentified object circling in the air. D-4505 appeared to be vaporized by the heat. It is assumed that D-4505 was temporarily killed by these visible heat rays and stored in SCP-2650-JP. The phenomenon that caused D-4505 to transform into Remilia Scarlet is currently unconfirmed.</p>\n<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> D-4505's body reacts violently to ultraviolet light; subject claims to feel pain when exposed to sunlight. Wings similar to those of bats (<em>Chiroptera</em>) extend from D-4505's shoulder blades, giving D-4505 the ability to fly. D-4505's body is able to transform into mist or bats, and additionally is able to act while in this state. D-4505's physical abilities have been anomalously increased, acting as if it transcends established laws of physics in its movements. As previously stated, D-4505 has gained immortality and can regenerate itself even when physically destroyed. Although this has not been confirmed due to difficulty of observation, D-4505 has also acquired the ability to observe and/or determine the future.</p>\n<p>Although D-4505 was a 59-year-old male prior to the experiment, its physical characteristics had become those of a young female. There have also been significant changes in D-4505's psychological profile, notably that the abnormal obsession with money that D-4505 originally possessed has not been observed. In addition, D-4505's memories prior to the experiment have been replaced with memories as Remilia Scarlet.</p>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Addendum 1:</strong> Information</p>\n<p>SCP-2955-JP's anomalous properties had not been discussed for an extended period of time due to the difficulty in obtaining information about it. As SCP-2650-JP is an object that is based in universes outside the base universe. The most pertinent information on SCP-2955-JP was obtained when Area-81JH was resolving an incident caused by GoI-093 \"PAMWAC\", which had been classified as separate from the anomaly. The following documents are excerpts from the internal BBS used by GoI-093.

Members of GoI-093 have avoided using the techniques associated with ElMA, and appeared to express a sense of urgency regarding the matters suggested in this post. Area-81JH has identified a post that appears to be the source of this response. The following is the full text in question.</p>\n<div style=\"display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px\">\n<h1 id=\"toc1\"><span>\u3010Important\u3011Announcement Thread</span></h1>\n<div style=\"display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px\">\n<p>11: <span style=\"font-size:larger;\"><span style=\"color: green\">Hara Shisui\u25c6SASAAAi</span> <span style=\"color: red\">\u2605</span></span><span style=\"color: gray\">\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588(\u2588) \u2588\u2588:\u2588\u2588:\u2588\u2588:\u2588\u2588 ID:???</span></p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Since there have been a lot of new people, and it seems that a lot of you are taking ElMA lightly, I'll take this time to remind you of why using ElMA is forbidden.</p>\n<p>The anime characters we want to marry are 2D, and they live in a lower narrative level to the world we live in. We're 3D, and they're 2D, as you probably already understand.</p>\n<p>Here's where it gets complicated. These 2D worlds' rules are set by us 3D beings.</p>\n<p>Luffy's arm can extend, Golgo 13's a skilled sniper, Hazama Kuroo is an unlicensed doctor. All that is determined by the creators of the story, who exist in the 3D world, saying \"this is how that world works\". No matter how hard Luffy struggles, he can't save Ace, and the surgery to save Dr. Honma won't succeed. Why? Because the author said so.</p>\n<p>It's called the \"absoluteness of the lower narrative levels\" because no matter how much the inhabitants of a 2D world try, they can't change the future (setting) that the author has determined. If the author doesn't change the setting, the world won't change on its own.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px\">\n<p>12: <span style=\"font-size:larger;\"><span style=\"color: green\">Hara Shisui\u25c6SASAAAi</span> <span style=\"color: red\">\u2605</span></span><span style=\"color: gray\">\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588(\u2588) \u2588\u2588:\u2588\u2588:\u2588\u2588:\u2588\u2588 ID:???</span></p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Alright, so the real question. Why is using ElMA banned?</p>\n<p>Using ElMA to call out 2D characters uses the ElMA Holy Seal Thaumaturgy, which is an external method that ignores the absoluteness of lower narrative levels. The ElMA Holy Seal Thaumaturgy itself says you can call out anything you want from other universes, and as long as you stick to that purpose, it's not that dangerous.</p>\n<p>However, calling out 2D characters is different. When you bring a character out of the 2D world, they're gone from that world. For good.</p>\n<p>Breaking the absoluteness of lower narrative levels has a lot of bad side effects. For instance, changing other existences into that character for consistency. The original being loses all its memories up to that point, and the change is permanent.</p>\n<p>\u2026 Just for that, some people think that it can be abused, but we have a problem with what happens next.</p>\n<p>After the alteration, there will be two characters - one in each world - but the one who isn't in the 2D world is weakened due to being freed from the absoluteness of lower narrative levels.</p>\n<p>As a simple example, there are characters who outright break the laws of physics, right? These characters maintain their existence because of the absoluteness of lower narrative levels. If they are freed from this property, they cannot live the way they are. They die a tragic death.</p>\n<p>If you really love that character, stay the hell away from this. When these consistency changes happen, that image of a lovely waifu will fall apart. And nobody wants that to happen.</p>\n<p>Although there are other reasons why ElMA is banned, this is the general gist of it. If you see anyone who might be using ElMA on the boards, make sure to tell us about it immediately. Thank you.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Addendum 2:</strong> Situation Report</p>\n<p>Area-81JH Intelligence Division discovered a post announcing that the character Remilia Scarlet had been summoned from the lower narrative level \"<em>Touhou Koumakyou ~ the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil.</em>\" on GoI-093's internal BBS.

Area-81JH Intelligence Division is to monitor for intrusions into lower narrative levels and prevent them when detected.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-2955-JP is a humanoid anomaly of variable appearance manifesting during tests with [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-2650-jp|SCP-2650-JP]]]. The anomaly affects human subjects who have been transferred from the universe in which this report was created (hereafter referred to as the base universe) into a lower narrative level, primarily through the anomalous effects of SCP-2650-JP. These subjects are altered to have the appearance consistent with that of the characters within the lower narrative level. This transformation consists of not only appearance but the physical structure of the subject's body and clothes. Behavioral changes have also been observed. In addition, it has been reported that affected individuals gain the abilities ascribed to the character they resemble, such as immortality and abilities that contravene the laws of physics, which have been classified under subspecies thaumaturgy.\n\n\n\nSCP-2955-JP's anomalous properties occur when a subject has been transferred from the base universe into the lower narrative level, which is then altered in some way. Initially, the Foundation had only speculative information about SCP-2955-JP. However, this report has been prepared based on cases observed by the Foundation, as well as several cases that were subsequently confirmed. For further information, please refer to SCP-2650-JP Experiment Log 2650-66.\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#f0f8ff; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n\n__**Experiment Log 2650-66 - \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588**__\n\n\n\n**Procedure:** D-4505 was provided with photography equipment and 8 years' worth of life-sustaining supplements, and disappeared along with SCP-2650-JP, with the aim of procuring information when D-4505 returned in some form.\n\n\n\n**Result:** After approximately 1 year, SCP-2650-JP was recovered, containing an object thought to be the body of D-4505. SCP-2650-JP also contained the photography equipment supplied to D-4505, from which video material has been successfully retrieved.\n\n\n\nD-4505 had acquired immortality during its disappearance, and recovered from its dead state a few minutes after opening SCP-2650-JP. However, its external appearance differed significantly from its previous appearance, instead resembling \"Remilia Scarlet\", a character from the //Touhou Project// series[[footnote]]Translator's note: Touhou Project is a series of vertical bullet hell shoot-'em-up games developed by Team Shanghai Alice, a one-man team consisting of Jun'ya \"ZUN\" Ota. It is known for its large fanbase and wide array of characters. In particular, Remilia Scarlet is one of the more well-known characters from the franchise, having debuted in the first Windows era game, //Touhou Koumakyou ~ the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil//.[[/footnote]]. \n\n\n\nThe recovered photography equipment shows D-4505 transforming into Remilia Scarlet while standing on what appears to be the roof of a building. In addition, a few days after the transformation, D-4505 appeared again on the rooftop, and was irradiated with visible heat rays by an unidentified object circling in the air. D-4505 appeared to be vaporized by the heat. It is assumed that D-4505 was temporarily killed by these visible heat rays and stored in SCP-2650-JP. The phenomenon that caused D-4505 to transform into Remilia Scarlet is currently unconfirmed.\n\n\n\n**Analysis:** D-4505's body reacts violently to ultraviolet light; subject claims to feel pain when exposed to sunlight. Wings similar to those of bats (//Chiroptera//) extend from D-4505's shoulder blades, giving D-4505 the ability to fly. D-4505's body is able to transform into mist or bats, and additionally is able to act while in this state. D-4505's physical abilities have been anomalously increased, acting as if it transcends established laws of physics in its movements. As previously stated, D-4505 has gained immortality and can regenerate itself even when physically destroyed. Although this has not been confirmed due to difficulty of observation, D-4505 has also acquired the ability to observe and/or determine the future.\n\n\n\nAlthough D-4505 was a 59-year-old male prior to the experiment, its physical characteristics had become those of a young female. There have also been significant changes in D-4505's psychological profile, notably that the abnormal obsession with money that D-4505 originally possessed has not been observed. In addition, D-4505's memories prior to the experiment have been replaced with memories as Remilia Scarlet.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n**Addendum 1:** Information\n\n\n\nSCP-2955-JP's anomalous properties had not been discussed for an extended period of time due to the difficulty in obtaining information about it. As SCP-2650-JP is an object that is based in universes outside the base universe. The most pertinent information on SCP-2955-JP was obtained when Area-81JH was resolving an incident caused by GoI-093 \"PAMWAC\", which had been classified as separate from the anomaly. The following documents are excerpts from the internal BBS used by GoI-093. The circumstances leading to their acquisition have been redacted by order of the Facility Management Committee of Area-81JH, with regard to the current countermeasures against the related GoI.\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px\"]]\n\n+ All About Remilia-chan Thread part563\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px\"]]\n\n221: [[size larger]]##green|\u25c6ge2212IK## [[/size]]##gray|\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588(\u2588) \u2588\u2588:\u2588\u2588:\u2588\u2588:\u2588\u2588 ID:???##\n\n----\n\nHas the Mistress[[footnote]]A slang term used by fans to refer to Remilia Scarlet.[[/footnote]] been ElMA'd?\n\nAm I wrong here?\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px\"]]\n\n222: [[size larger]]##green|Indomitable Anonymous## [[/size]]##gray|\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588(\u2588) \u2588\u2588:\u2588\u2588:\u2588\u2588:\u2588\u2588 ID:??\uff1f##\n\n----\n\n##blue|>>221##\n\nOf course she is?

The term \"ElMA'd\" has been determined to be used on GoI-093's internal BBS to refer to \"using ElMA to abduct a character from its native setting\". Members of GoI-093 have avoided using the techniques associated with ElMA, and appeared to express a sense of urgency regarding the matters suggested in this post. Area-81JH has identified a post that appears to be the source of this response. The following is the full text in question.\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px\"]]\n\n+ \u3010Important\u3011Announcement Thread\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px\"]]\n\n11: [[size larger]]##green|Hara Shisui\u25c6SASAAAi## ##red|\u2605##[[/size]]##gray|\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588(\u2588) \u2588\u2588:\u2588\u2588:\u2588\u2588:\u2588\u2588 ID:???##\n\n----\n\nSince there have been a lot of new people, and it seems that a lot of you are taking ElMA lightly, I'll take this time to remind you of why using ElMA is forbidden.\n\n\n\nThe anime characters we want to marry are 2D, and they live in a lower narrative level to the world we live in. We're 3D, and they're 2D, as you probably already understand.\n\n\n\nHere's where it gets complicated. These 2D worlds' rules are set by us 3D beings. \n\n\n\nLuffy's arm can extend, Golgo 13's a skilled sniper, Hazama Kuroo is an unlicensed doctor. All that is determined by the creators of the story, who exist in the 3D world, saying \"this is how that world works\". No matter how hard Luffy struggles, he can't save Ace, and the surgery to save Dr. Honma won't succeed. Why? Because the author said so.\n\n\n\nIt's called the \"absoluteness of the lower narrative levels\" because no matter how much the inhabitants of a 2D world try, they can't change the future (setting) that the author has determined. If the author doesn't change the setting, the world won't change on its own.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px\"]]\n\n12: [[size larger]]##green|Hara Shisui\u25c6SASAAAi## ##red|\u2605##[[/size]]##gray|\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588(\u2588) \u2588\u2588:\u2588\u2588:\u2588\u2588:\u2588\u2588 ID:???##\n\n----\n\nAlright, so the real question. Why is using ElMA banned?\n\n\n\nUsing ElMA to call out 2D characters uses the ElMA Holy Seal Thaumaturgy, which is an external method that ignores the absoluteness of lower narrative levels. The ElMA Holy Seal Thaumaturgy itself says you can call out anything you want from other universes, and as long as you stick to that purpose, it's not that dangerous.\n\n\n\nHowever, calling out 2D characters is different. When you bring a character out of the 2D world, they're gone from that world. For good.\n\n\n\nBreaking the absoluteness of lower narrative levels has a lot of bad side effects. For instance, changing other existences into that character for consistency. The original being loses all its memories up to that point, and the change is permanent. \n\n\n\n... Just for that, some people think that it can be abused, but we have a problem with what happens next.\n\n\n\nAfter the alteration, there will be two characters - one in each world - but the one who isn't in the 2D world is weakened due to being freed from the absoluteness of lower narrative levels.\n\n\n\nAs a simple example, there are characters who outright break the laws of physics, right? These characters maintain their existence because of the absoluteness of lower narrative levels. If they are freed from this property, they cannot live the way they are. They die a tragic death.\n\n\n\nIf you really love that character, stay the hell away from this. When these consistency changes happen, that image of a lovely waifu will fall apart. And nobody wants that to happen.\n\n\n\nAlthough there are other reasons why ElMA is banned, this is the general gist of it. If you see anyone who might be using ElMA on the boards, make sure to tell us about it immediately. Thank you.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n**Addendum 2:** Situation Report\n\n\n\nArea-81JH Intelligence Division discovered a post announcing that the character Remilia Scarlet had been summoned from the lower narrative level \"//Touhou Koumakyou ~ the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil.//\" on GoI-093's internal BBS. The contents suggested that the poster was a follower of Eden leap Mutual Aid, and may have used the ElMA Holy Seal Thaumaturgy. This was also known to the administrators of GoI-093 at the time, who attempted to identify the person responsible for the post.\n\n\n\nUpon receiving this information, the Foundation conjectured that SCP-2955-JP's anomalies and D-4505's transformation occured due to an unknown individual abducting Remilia Scarlet from the setting of //Touhou Koumakyou ~ the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil.//, and that the resulting disappearance of Remilia Scarlet from the setting caused D-4505, who had been transferred to that narrative setting at the time, to transform into Remilia Scarlet.\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px\"]]\n\n+ I'm counting down the days until my idol from my teenage years marries me lol\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px\"]]\n\n22: [[size larger]]##green|\u25c6dnn87qI## [[/size]]##gray|\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588(\u2588) \u2588\u2588:\u2588\u2588:\u2588\u2588:\u2588\u2588 ID:???##\n\n----\n\nJust need to prepare the documents and that's it...\n\nRemilia herself has already come over to our world\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px\"]]\n\n23: [[size larger]]##green|Shackled Anonymous## [[/size]]##gray|\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588(\u2588) \u2588\u2588:\u2588\u2588:\u2588\u2588:\u2588\u2588 ID:???##\n\n----\n\nLooks like a troll...\n\nHow did you do it?

The parameter around the shed containing SCP-444-KO-1~5 is to be blocked and guarded and must be prohibited civilian access. Also, each instance should be regularly monitored, especially SCP-444-KO-5. Visual observation of SCP-444-KO-5 is only allowed to 1~4/444K class personnel.</p>\n<p>Class 1~4/444K personnel affected by the infohazard should not communicate with the unaffected due to the probability of the increase in infection. Such interaction is only allowed to the reporting person. 1~4/444K class personnel must be locked in Site-657 to perform their tasks. Exiting is prohibited.</p>\n<p>The tasks of class 1~4/444K are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Research Personnel:</strong> They should mainly search for the identity of the killer of SCP-444-KO-5. Additionally, they should analyse the 'murder' that had happened at the shed.</li>\n<li><strong>Report Personnel:</strong> They are responsible for communication between the affected and unaffected, reporting minimal information without the infohazard, and the research progress. Also, they should answer whether if the protocol is being abided.</li>\n<li><strong>Investigation Personnel:</strong> They should investigate the shed and find clues for the murder. Research personnel are to analyse these clues then.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The killers of SCP-444-KO-5 must be found. When the convict is found, SCP-444-KO-5 can be readjusted to Euclid according to the reports of 1~4/444K class personnel, while the personnel are removed of their classes and return to regular duty. 1~4/444K class personnel must proceed with the investigation daily to find the murderer of SCP-444-KO-5, and if this is not done class 1~4/444K class Report Personnel activate protocol '<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Copy</span>'.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-444-KO refers to five dead bodies located in a shed in Mt.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588. The most recently found instance, SCP-444-KO-5 is thought to be a simple infohazard, but it showed its danger when multiple other bodies were found in the shed during Incident 444K-12.</p>\n<p>These bodies(except SCP-444-KO-5) is thought to be dead at 1983, but shows no signs of decay, enabling the Foundation to identify the person and the cause of death. However, SCP-444-KO-5's form was severely distorted, making it impossible to identify.</p>\n<p>When the Foundation tried to move these bodies for the sake of containment, the bodies did not move at all, and all attempts to move the bodies have failed. (Check below for the case of SCP-444-KO-5)</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>SCP-444-KO-1</strong></span></p>\n<p>Buried in front of the main gate on the first floor, it is thought to be the body of Age Osmond, an African in his 40s. He seems to have died massive blood loss due to a sharp object in the abdomen, no other suspicious point were found. He is confirmed to be the consumer finance professional.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>SCP-444-KO-2</strong></span></p>\n<p>Hidden in the mattress of a bed in the bedroom on the second floor, it is thought to be the body of a Caucasian female in her 20s, named Rola Sherman. She seems to have died instantly after her head was hit by a vase<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> The constricted hand was grabbing a severely rusty knife<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> It is confirmed that the subject gained a substantial amount of debt while working at a bar.

The posterior of his skull is severely damaged. His cause of death seems to be a broken neck, and it is theorised that he fell to his death. No other notable points were discovered.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>SCP-444-KO-4</strong></span></p>\n<p>Nailed on the corner of the roof, the body is thought to be that of Sara Jordan, a Caucasian female in her 30s. The cause of death seems to be multiple stab wounds by a sharp object, including one on her hand, likely caused by some sharp and big shard. She is confirmed to be the owner of the bar where SCP-444-KO-2 used to work.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>SCP-444-KO-5</strong></span></p>\n<p>A body thought to be murdered and hung on the ceiling of the basement, likely disguised as if they committed suicide. Because of severe distortion, the body cannot be confirmed of its identity. Researchers presume the body to be female. Touching the body with one's hand makes them feel sadness and despair.(For further information, refer to Research log 444K-16)</p>\n<p>This body was found first and then given the number SCP-444-KO, but its designation changed when other bodies were found during incident 444K-12. If a person sees SCP-444-KO-5 at the with their bare eyes, they experience a cognitive manipulation that makes them firmly believe that the instance is a human, and has been murdered. However, after incident 444K-12, it is confirmed that SCP-444-KO-5 is a human, and there was in fact, a murder in the shed. Researchers brought up with two theories for this instance; that they were the killer, or they took their own life not wanting to be killed.</p>\n<p>The agent that tried to untie the rope which SCP-444-KO-5 was hung on disappeared. This agent was never seen again. Further attempts like these are not recommended.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>After SCP-444-KO-1~4 was found, SCP-444-KO attained a new cognitohazardous trait, leading to incident 444K-12. In anyone finds out about SCP-444-KO-1~4 or the murder by any means, the person suffers similar anomalous events as if they saw SCP-444-KO-5 on site. Additional traits of these anomalous events include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hearing voices including 'multiple' screaming.</li>\n<li>Gaining immunity from the event when seeing SCP-444-KO-5 directly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Amnestics were administered to some of the exposed of incident 444K-12, but they all died as if they were 'murdered' after a day.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup> investigation about this has been assigned to class 1~4/444K personnel as an additional duty, and now under progress. Considering the fact that the exposed are essential individuals of the Foundation, SCP-444-KO has been re-classified as Keter.</p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">+\u00a0Incident\u00a0log\u00a0444K-12</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">-\u00a0Close</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>At 08/07/2004, while an investigation team of 10 people was searching around the shed, the incident started when an agent tripped on the hand of an SCP-444-KO instance. Shortly after, agent \u2588\u2588\u2588 dug up SCP-444-KO-1, while other members of the team looked around the shed for more details in case of there being more bodies. The team found SCP-444-KO-2~4 this way, and written information about these instances was passed onto Site-657.</p>\n<p>At July 9th, all 28 Foundation personnel died of various causes. Except for six who are yet uncertain if they were murdered or took their own lives, were presumed to be 'murdered'. Ten had their brains penetrated by a firearm, five fell to their deaths, and seven had their occiput damaged. Ten of the dead were in the shed investigation team.</p>\n<p>After 28 people were killed, about two hours later, all the three Class-4 personnel of the command centre were shot to death. Afterwards, half of all Site-657's personnel died. Because of the hazardous trait of the anomaly, researchers of the site were tasked with finding what the deceased had in common. They found that the dead had fallen victim to a cognitohazard after reading a document about SCP-444-KO-1~4. However, additional incidents happened followed. (Refer to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Document 444K-51-B</span>)</p>\n<p>It is uncertain who killed them, but there is a theory that this is also the effect of SCP-444-KO-5. Currently, it is of second priority for class 1~4/444K personnel to find out who they were murdered by.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">+\u00a0Research\u00a0log\u00a0444K-16</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">-\u00a0Close</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>We have no additional traits to know from SCP-444-KO-1~4; therefore we are focusing on research about SCP-444-KO-5.</p>\n<p>We are conducting research based on the theory that SCP-444-KO-5 contains the spirit of the dead. It is crucial that we find out what happened in the past in studying this instance, and what happens if one touches it. I, therefore, doubt that SCP-444-KO-5 was murdered.</p>\n<p>I also agree to some degree that SCP-444-KO-5 is the convict of the murder. Maybe then, -5 might have called -1~-4 out to the shed and killed them, but not knowing there was a sixth person who was trying to kill her.</p>\n<p>Why this sixth person tried to kill SCP-444-KO-5 is uncertain. Also, it's still speculation that this sixth person even exists. We did not gather any compelling evidence that this is the case.</p>\n<p>But there are things that I still cannot understand. Why did SCP-444-KO-5 have to change its weapon so many times? It's inevitable that SCP-444-KO-5 was carrying a knife. There's a lot of things that we don't know yet.</p>\n<p>- Class 3/444K researcher John</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><iframe allowtransparency=\"true\" class=\"html-block-iframe\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"/scp-444-ko/html/131c4f3bcf75f5d4ccc071bfcee13747b62ee445-4363588251314565873\"></iframe></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:white\">4423144444</span></p>\n<div class=\"footnotes-footer\">\n<div class=\"title\">Footnotes</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-1\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-1')\">1</a>.

Until SCP-503-KO's full containment, access to contaminated digital networks and databases, including SCiPNET, is allowed to designated recovery and research personnel.

SCP-503-KO was first introduced to increase visual information input and increase visibility via icons. However, due to complaints regarding the lack of adequacy and intuitiveness of the system, SCP-503-KO was being run on trial until 20\u2588\u2588.<br/>\n<br/>\nSCP-503-KO is composed of five detailed classification systems and their representative visual icons and a series of web design codes to render on digital documents. Originally, SCP-503-KO is attached file covers or top of documents, followed by the main text. However, due to the anomaly which initially manifested on June 20\u2588\u2588, SCP-503-KO applied document fails to display its text, except the attached SCP-503-KO. The disappeared main text then is displayed as a footnote on SCP-503-KO.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother major anomaly of SCP-503-KO is its self-replication. SCP-503-KO is spontaneously applied to random documents without ACS, further spreading data contamination. The contamination is strongly assumed to occur during server-client communication for document storage or transmission.<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently, there is no evidence that SCP-503-KO can manifest in non-electrical, analogue documents. However, due to the uncertain nature of its anomaly and the potential risk of a containment breach, usage of SCP-503-KO is banned on all documents regardless of its form.</span> <sup><strong>6</strong></sup></span></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"classimage\" style=\"height: 46px; border-left: 8px solid #0087BD; background-color: #D9EDF5; background-image: url('http://scpko.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-503-ko/503ko-caution.png'); font-weight: 500; padding: 0 0 0 10px; margin: -8px 0 0 4px;\">\n<p>RISK CLASS:<br/>\n<span class=\"classtext C\" style=\"margin-top: -6px;\">CAUTION<span class=\"hover\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><span class=\"right hh\"><strong>FOOTNOTE 7.</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Manifestation Timeline</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>06/01/20\u2588\u2588:</strong> The O5 Council authorises SCP-503-KO as an official Foundation classification system and orders the Science department and the Records and Information Security Administration to apply SCP-503-KO to all documents.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>06/08/20\u2588\u2588:</strong> Researcher Hariuchi Eido reports missing contents after application of SCP-503-KO on SCP-097-KO document. This is the first known manifestation of SCP-503-KO. The Records and Information Security Administration, which was responsible for the management of SCP-503-KO, ran an analysis but failed to find any problems in the code.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>06/10/20\u2588\u2588:</strong> For two consecutive days, almost all applied SCP-503-KO shows the same malfunction. As the removal of SCP-503-KO from affected documents became impossible, each command headquarters switched to the non-electrical backup work system per network containment response protocols. From this point on, SCP-503-KO started spreading to formerly not applied documents.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>06/11/20\u2588\u2588:</strong> SCP-503-KO is recognised as an extranormal event and is given a formal SCP designation.

SCP-503-KO was first introduced to increase visual information input and increase visibility via icons. However, due to complaints regarding the lack of adequacy and intuitiveness of the system, SCP-503-KO was being run on trial until 20\u2588\u2588.<br/>\n<br/>\nSCP-503-KO is composed of five detailed classification systems and their representative visual icons and a series of web design codes to render on digital documents. Originally, SCP-503-KO is attached file covers or top of documents, followed by the main text. However, due to the anomaly which initially manifested on June 20\u2588\u2588, SCP-503-KO applied document fails to display its text, except the attached SCP-503-KO. The disappeared main text then is displayed as a footnote on SCP-503-KO.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother major anomaly of SCP-503-KO is its self-replication. SCP-503-KO is spontaneously applied to random documents without ACS, further spreading data contamination. The contamination is strongly assumed to occur during server-client communication for document storage or transmission.<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently, there is no evidence that SCP-503-KO can manifest in non-electrical, analogue documents. However, due to the uncertain nature of its anomaly and the potential risk of a containment breach, usage of SCP-503-KO is banned on all documents regardless of its form.</span> <sup><strong>6</strong></sup></span></span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"mini1 classimage\" style=\"width: calc( 100% - 22px ); height: 22px; border-left: 8px solid #0087BD; background-color: #D9EDF5; background-image: url('http://scpko.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-503-ko/503ko-caution.png'); font-weight: 500; padding: 0 0 0 10px; margin: -8px 4px 0 4px;\">\n<p>RISK CLASS: <span class=\"classtext C\">CAUTION<span class=\"hover\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><span class=\"right hh\"><strong>FOOTNOTE 7.</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Manifestation Timeline</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>06/01/20\u2588\u2588:</strong> The O5 Council authorises SCP-503-KO as an official Foundation classification system and orders the Science department and the Records and Information Security Administration to apply SCP-503-KO to all documents.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>06/08/20\u2588\u2588:</strong> Researcher Hariuchi Eido reports missing contents after application of SCP-503-KO on SCP-097-KO document.

If SCP-503-KO is an anomalous concept, our actions against it will be severely limited. However, I cannot agree to decommission SCP-503-KO. I have a few reasons:</em><br/>\n<br/>\n<em>Considering that we are currently unaware of the specifics of SCP-503-KO's anomaly, the only decommission method is the elimination of its concept. To do this, every related individual must forget SCP-503-KO. No records and A.I. conscripts should remain as a backup, as they too cannot avoid SCP-503-KO contamination. In short, there will be no measures left in the Foundation of remembering and dealing with SCP-503-KO following its decommissioning. Given that decommissioning itself is a rare procedure, no decommissioned subjects have so far presupposed that the Foundation forgets it. If SCP-503-KO retains its anomaly after the decommission attempt and spreads again, it will consequently stall countermeasures, leading to more devastation.</em><br/>\n<br/>\n<em>Even if we agree on discarding, problems remain. Commands have classified all electronic devices in use as SCP-503-KO contaminants and recalled them. The number of these equipment ranging from server computers to USB flash drives counts up to 2.77 trillion. All of this equipment lost at once is only on the verge of recovery after three months, and the cost for it is much higher than five years worth of the Foundation's equipment budget. This is excluding the workforce and time spent on entering every analogue backup data to new equipment one by one. The Foundation cannot risk this amount of loss again.</em><br/>\n<br/>\n<em>Currently, the best solution is to temporarily contain all SCP-503-KO affected devices and make use of the offline work system. I am painfully aware of the drastic decrease in work efficiency after the SCiPNET lockdown, but you must understand that this is a desperate measure to protect minimal functionality and organisation of the Foundation.

I strongly suggest that SCP-503-KO's anomaly stems from outside the program. To specify, there is a compelling possibility that the idea of the \"Anomaly Classification System\" retains an anomaly in and of itself. We must not put aside the possibility that SCP-503-KO can spread outside the network, to analogue documents and to our employee's thoughts, just like it spread beyond the separated network. If this becomes the case, it will spread its hands on every Foundation personnel with knowledge of \"ACS\", and it would be a matter of time that it spreads outside the Foundation. (I named this possibility the AS-Class \"Anomaly\" Scenario.)</em><br/>\n<br/>\n<em>None of the infohazards that have existed so far has been found to be anomalous after the Foundation had so actively spread them. Worse, it's hard to find any other examples of a self-aware, sentient infohazard actively trying to proliferate. I am very sure that now when SCP-503-KO's anomaly is confined to Foundation digital space, it is the last chance that we can stop it. Therefore, I suggest a complete and irreversible decommission of SCP-503-KO. All Foundation electronic devices are to be discarded regardless of contamination, and all recording and memories regarding SCP-503-KO must be wiped. - Director Jean Karlyle Aktus</em></span><sup><strong>12</strong></sup></span></span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"mini1 classimage\" style=\"width: calc( 100% - 22px ); height: 22px; border-left: 8px solid #FFD300; background-color: #FFF8D9; background-image: url('http://scpko.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-503-ko/503ko-warning.png'); font-weight: 500; padding: 0 0 0 10px; margin: -8px 4px 0 4px;\">\n<p>RISK CLASS: <span class=\"classtext C\">WARNING<span class=\"hover\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><span class=\"right hh\"><strong>FOOTNOTE 13.</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<em>I am well aware of your consideration, Director Aktus. If SCP-503-KO is an anomalous concept, our actions against it will be severely limited. However, I cannot agree to decommission SCP-503-KO. I have a few reasons:</em><br/>\n<br/>\n<em>Considering that we are currently unaware of the specifics of SCP-503-KO's anomaly, the only decommission method is the elimination of its concept. To do this, every related individual must forget SCP-503-KO. No records and A.I. conscripts should remain as a backup, as they too cannot avoid SCP-503-KO contamination. In short, there will be no measures left in the Foundation of remembering and dealing with SCP-503-KO following its decommissioning. Given that decommissioning itself is a rare procedure, no decommissioned subjects have so far presupposed that the Foundation forgets it. If SCP-503-KO retains its anomaly after the decommission attempt and spreads again, it will consequently stall countermeasures, leading to more devastation.</em><br/>\n<br/>\n<em>Even if we agree on discarding, problems remain. Commands have classified all electronic devices in use as SCP-503-KO contaminants and recalled them. The number of these equipment ranging from server computers to USB flash drives counts up to 2.77 trillion. All of this equipment lost at once is only on the verge of recovery after three months, and the cost for it is much higher than five years worth of the Foundation's equipment budget. This is excluding the workforce and time spent on entering every analogue backup data to new equipment one by one. The Foundation cannot risk this amount of loss again.</em><br/>\n<br/>\n<em>Currently, the best solution is to temporarily contain all SCP-503-KO affected devices and make use of the offline work system. I am painfully aware of the drastic decrease in work efficiency after the SCiPNET lockdown, but you must understand that this is a desperate measure to protect minimal functionality and organisation of the Foundation. (Even for me, it has been seventy years since I've sent a</em> hand-written letter <em>for work purposes) Further orders regarding your suggestion will be given after the O5 Council readdresses it.

All departments that handle digital documents, including Science, Administrations, Logistics and such, are reporting issues related to ACS, and those issue reports all have ACS applied to them. SCiPNET's report system is freezing. All command personnel are to check inter-site communication webs and resort to non-electrical report systems.

The Foundation Records and Information Security Administration is to retrieve all SCP-503-KO applied documents and revise them. If removal of SCP-503-KO is possible, it is removed. If not, the contents are extracted and recorded via analogue means. Until SCP-503-KO's full containment, access to contaminated digital networks and databases, including SCiPNET, is allowed to designated recovery and research personnel. Affected servers and client terminals must be quarantined from the Foundation intranet.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe SCP-503-KO research team is to analyse its self-replicating and information censorship properties and find a viable containment method. All personnel accessing any contaminated networks and databases should use designated terminal devices and must not carry other digital communication or storage devices. When trying to retrieve information from or add new information to SCP-503-KO affected documents, one must use the footnote function.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #b01\">6</span>. <strong>Description:</strong> SCP-503-KO is an alternative classification system partially applied to Foundation records, commonly known as the <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/anomaly-classification-system-guide\">Anomaly Classification System(ACS)</a>. SCP-503-KO was first introduced to increase visual information input and increase visibility via icons. However, due to complaints regarding the lack of adequacy and intuitiveness of the system, SCP-503-KO was being run on trial until 20\u2588\u2588.<br/>\n<br/>\nSCP-503-KO is composed of five detailed classification systems and their representative visual icons and a series of web design codes to render on digital documents. Originally, SCP-503-KO is attached file covers or top of documents, followed by the main text. However, due to the anomaly which initially manifested on June 20\u2588\u2588, SCP-503-KO applied document fails to display its text, except the attached SCP-503-KO. The disappeared main text then is displayed as a footnote on SCP-503-KO.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother major anomaly of SCP-503-KO is its self-replication. SCP-503-KO is spontaneously applied to random documents without ACS, further spreading data contamination. The contamination is strongly assumed to occur during server-client communication for document storage or transmission.<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently, there is no evidence that SCP-503-KO can manifest in non-electrical, analogue documents. However, due to the uncertain nature of its anomaly and the potential risk of a containment breach, usage of SCP-503-KO is banned on all documents regardless of its form.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #b01\">7</span>. <strong>Manifestation Timeline</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>06/01/20\u2588\u2588:</strong> The O5 Council authorises SCP-503-KO as an official Foundation classification system and orders the Science department and the Records and Information Security Administration to apply SCP-503-KO to all documents.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>06/08/20\u2588\u2588:</strong> Researcher Hariuchi Eido reports missing contents after application of SCP-503-KO on SCP-097-KO document. This is the first known manifestation of SCP-503-KO. The Records and Information Security Administration, which was responsible for the management of SCP-503-KO, ran an analysis but failed to find any problems in the code.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>06/10/20\u2588\u2588:</strong> For two consecutive days, almost all applied SCP-503-KO shows the same malfunction. As the removal of SCP-503-KO from affected documents became impossible, each command headquarters switched to the non-electrical backup work system per network containment response protocols. From this point on, SCP-503-KO started spreading to formerly not applied documents.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>06/11/20\u2588\u2588:</strong> SCP-503-KO is recognised as an extranormal event and is given a formal SCP designation. Currently, the anomaly is limited to the Foundation. However, due to its uncontrollable nature, SCP-503-KO is designated as Keter. A research team is founded to search for containment measures for SCP-503-KO.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>06/12/20\u2588\u2588:</strong> SCP-503-KO manifests on the formally unaffected digital copy of this document. As the usage of SCP-503-KO was halted, it was given a containment class. However, the class 'Keneq' and 'Notice' is arbitrarily added to the sign. The mentioned copy is segregated from the network and stored for research purposes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>06/15/20\u2588\u2588:</strong> Physical containment of all existing SCiPNET components. Contaminated servers and clients are separated from the web and archived. Primary contact networks are recovered via the introduction of a new server network. Other tasks will be maintained in an analogue form first and will be restored in stages depending on the conditions. Reclassification of SCP-503-KO as Euclid is reviewed in case of prolonged containment, and its actions are being monitored for the time being.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>06/16/20\u2588\u2588:</strong> Risk class displayed on stored digital report of SCP-503-KO changed from 'Notice' to 'Caution'. There was no discussion regarding such reclassification by the research team or related administrative branches, as SCP-503-KO's original classification system is no longer in use. Theories regarding SCP-503-KO's possible sentience or cognition and random changes have been suggested but with no clear conclusion.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #b01\">8</span>. The digital storage copy has been edited again. This is the first time that the contents left in the form of footnotes wiped out, and clearance levels and object classes set by the research team changed. I do not think there is any other way to explain this except SCP-503-KO's autonomous manipulation. - Doctor P.L. Briller</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #b01\">9</span>. As you've already noticed, Doctor Briller's message added to the copy sent from the recovered intranet, not the quarantined old SCiPNET. Physical separation of the two networks should have made SCP-503-KO referring to the message impossible. However, considering its autonomous editing and range of cognition beyond its network environment, SCP-503-KO is more than a normal computer program. Rather, we should seriously consider the possibility that it can be an anomalous, sentient complex, i.e. an advanced artificial intelligence including cognition and self-awareness.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Research team and the Records and Information Security Administration request your help, O5-7, as one of the initial developers of SCP-503-KO. You were deeply involved in all major parts of SCP-503-KO's making, including the classification system, visual icon design and code writing. Testimonies of related individuals are vital for uncovering SCP-503-KO's current situation and tracking down where the anomaly was triggered in the system.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #b01\">10</span>. <strong><span style=\"color: #b01\">WARNING: THIS IS NOT A LEVEL 1 CLEARANCE DOCUMENT.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR COOPERATION - SCP ADMINISTRATIONS</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #b01\">12</span>. <em>The sign seems to appear normal after manually entering temporary disruption/risk classes. Nevertheless, the text is still missing, and the anomaly is now breaching network containment, so it's still impossible to normalise work conditions in this state.</em><br/>\n<br/>\n<em>I went through every component of the development kit and current codes but was unable to find any problems. I strongly suggest that SCP-503-KO's anomaly stems from outside the program. To specify, there is a compelling possibility that the idea of the \"Anomaly Classification System\" retains an anomaly in and of itself. We must not put aside the possibility that SCP-503-KO can spread outside the network, to analogue documents and to our employee's thoughts, just like it spread beyond the separated network. If this becomes the case, it will spread its hands on every Foundation personnel with knowledge of \"ACS\", and it would be a matter of time that it spreads outside the Foundation. (I named this possibility the AS-Class \"Anomaly\" Scenario.)</em><br/>\n<br/>\n<em>None of the infohazards that have existed so far has been found to be anomalous after the Foundation had so actively spread them. Worse, it's hard to find any other examples of a self-aware, sentient infohazard actively trying to proliferate. I am very sure that now when SCP-503-KO's anomaly is confined to Foundation digital space, it is the last chance that we can stop it. Therefore, I suggest a complete and irreversible decommission of SCP-503-KO. All Foundation electronic devices are to be discarded regardless of contamination, and all recording and memories regarding SCP-503-KO must be wiped. - Director Jean Karlyle Aktus</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #b01\">13</span>. <em>I am well aware of your consideration, Director Aktus. If SCP-503-KO is an anomalous concept, our actions against it will be severely limited. However, I cannot agree to decommission SCP-503-KO. I have a few reasons:</em><br/>\n<br/>\n<em>Considering that we are currently unaware of the specifics of SCP-503-KO's anomaly, the only decommission method is the elimination of its concept. To do this, every related individual must forget SCP-503-KO. No records and A.I. conscripts should remain as a backup, as they too cannot avoid SCP-503-KO contamination. In short, there will be no measures left in the Foundation of remembering and dealing with SCP-503-KO following its decommissioning. Given that decommissioning itself is a rare procedure, no decommissioned subjects have so far presupposed that the Foundation forgets it. If SCP-503-KO retains its anomaly after the decommission attempt and spreads again, it will consequently stall countermeasures, leading to more devastation.</em><br/>\n<br/>\n<em>Even if we agree on discarding, problems remain. Commands have classified all electronic devices in use as SCP-503-KO contaminants and recalled them. The number of these equipment ranging from server computers to USB flash drives counts up to 2.77 trillion. All of this equipment lost at once is only on the verge of recovery after three months, and the cost for it is much higher than five years worth of the Foundation's equipment budget. This is excluding the workforce and time spent on entering every analogue backup data to new equipment one by one. The Foundation cannot risk this amount of loss again.</em><br/>\n<br/>\n<em>Currently, the best solution is to temporarily contain all SCP-503-KO affected devices and make use of the offline work system. I am painfully aware of the drastic decrease in work efficiency after the SCiPNET lockdown, but you must understand that this is a desperate measure to protect minimal functionality and organisation of the Foundation. (Even for me, it has been seventy years since I've sent a</em> hand-written letter <em>for work purposes) Further orders regarding your suggestion will be given after the O5 Council readdresses it. Continue with your work. We must obtain measures to contain or neutralise SCP-503-KO without further damage. - O5-7</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #b01\">14</span>. It says \"Secret\", but every paper that is anywhere is covered with this thing. Are you sure this is limited to inside the Foundation? - Researcher Hariuchi Eido</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #b01\">15</span>. SCP-503-KO's effects are spreading out of control. SCP-503-KO is applied not only on printed documents but hand-written documents too. I don't know how this is possible. Anything barely readable contains SCP-503-KO with their content removed. We can't continue working. Forget containment, every single letter from simple administrative documents to Foundation employee cafeteria menus are contaminated, and nothing can be done on paper? How the hell did it end this way? - Doctor Seo Ain</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #b01\">16</span>. SCP-503-KO is both a sentient information entity and a strong infohazard. It took over all types of Foundation documents and openly requested that its demands are met by its own format. This risky containment is being sustained thanks to the knowledge of ACS limited inside the Foundation, but nobody knows what will happen if work freezes for longer. We must proceed with large-scale document destruction and memory wipes to purify SCP-503-KO containment. - Computer security officer Son Inseop</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #b01\">17</span>. It might be too late. Look. We can't even write letters, and SCP-503-KO is collecting spoken sentences. No one knows how fast or much this thing can grow. Nobody is sure this isn't a meme. Maybe this thing might have spread outside under our dysfunctional radar. The AS-Class \"Anomaly\" Scenario has already unfolded. Aktus'es warning was our last chance. We dragged this on for too long. - Doctor Jack Bright</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #b01\">18</span>. You made a good point while complaining, Doctor Bright; that SCP-503-KO might be a meme\u2026 No, I am convinced that SCP-503-KO is a meme.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn retrospect, the \"Anomaly Classification System\" was an idea too crude to be applied as it is. The objective of increasing visibility through icons lead to counterproductive flooding of hardly recognisable icons, and the included subclasses only burdened us with more stuff to memorise. <em>'Esoteric-Classes'</em> sprouting from these was a matter of time; SCP-503-KO only got the lead.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't think the fact that O5-7 created this system is the only reason that the RAISA and various directors were so keen on this system, despite its apparent flaws. There was an attempt to defend it for its aesthetic value and flashy visuals, but most just adopted the ACS because it was new: not a plausible reason to accept it for intellectuals like us. Come on, what are we? An internet fansite? I cannot explain this phenomenon in another way than SCP-503-KO being a meme.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf SCP-503-KO is really a meme, the thing that worries me the most is NOT the AS-Class scenario. 'Humans' are commonly put in a special position regarding the activation of memes, but strictly speaking, this is close to an idol of a species. Memes that spread spontaneously on information media do not need humans as a medium for spreading. If this is the case, humans are\u2026 merely another 'information media' where it can dwell. After digital documents, printed documents, written documents and spoken conversation, if SCP-503-KO infiltrates our language system and memories, could we possibly defend against it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\u2026SCP-503-KO is calling itself \"Wildfire\". I can sense the irresistible urge to spread regardless. If we have to demolish the prairie to stop this fire, we mustn't hesitate. The Foundation must vanish with SCP-503-KO for all humanity. Now or never, this or nothing. - Doctor Choi Duik</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #b01\">19</span>. I agree with Doctor Choi's suggestion.</p>\n<p>Proceed, 1.</p>\n<p>SCP-503-KO must be neutralised. - O5-7</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #b01\">20</span>. Broadcasting orders to command.

A security guard is to be posted in a small sentry post at the entrance of SCP-521-KO.</p>\n<p>In the event that a civilian enters and becomes trapped within SCP-521-KO, the lighthouse at <a href=\"/secure-facility-dossier-site-64k\">Site-64K</a> is to project an intense beam of light toward the sea. Rescued civilians shall be interrogated and released following treatment with Class-C amnestics.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-521-KO is a jetty pointing seaward, located in Mujin City, South Jeolla Province, South Korea. It was constructed in 1970 as a piece of landscaping art and its wave breaking performance is nominal. The surface of SCP-521-KO is usually wet, and slippery enough that walking on SCP-521-KO is often difficult.</p>\n<p>The anomalous effect of SCP-521-KO will manifest in mornings and evenings during conditions of heavy fog. If an individual climbs onto SCP-521-KO and walks seaward during rising fog, heavy enough to obscure anything beyond their immediate vicinity, they will be unable to reach the outer end of SCP-521-KO, regardless of the distance travelled. Additionally, after travelling about 10\u00a0m seaward, they become unable to reach the opposite end of SCP-521-KO, i.e. they can no longer return to Mujin. During high visibility, with no fog, this effect does not manifest. If the subject accesses SCP-521-KO from the sea, using a ship or helicopter, they can disembark onto SCP-521-KO's outer end even during foggy conditions. However, if they walk more than 10m landward, they also become unable to return to the outer end.</p>\n<p>If a strong source of light emits a beam from any point towards SCP-521-KO while a subject is trapped on it, they become able to reach the side from where the light originates. Consequently, if the fog lifts enough to improve visibility in either direction, the anomalous effect is also nullified. Thus, subjects trapped on SCP-521-KO only have to wait for the fog to clear to be able to return.</p>\n<p>However, for as long as the subject keeps walking on SCP-521-KO, the fog will not clear. In a recent test, an individual on SCP-521-KO claimed that she had been walking for an entire day, whereas outside of SCP-521-KO, only three hours passed. On SCP-521-KO's outer end is a brass plaque whose contents are clearly legible from the seaward side.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Seeing</em> is more than a photon's collision on your retina.

The object's distinction lies in complete lack of information pertaining to it in any historical or contemporary records. This is achieved by widespread use of anomalously programmed chemical agents causing varied effects of amnesia and altered cognition.</p>\n<p>On \u2588\u2588.\u2588\u2588.19\u2588\u2588 the object came into contact with the Foundation in person on one of its former operating frequencies and offered a mutually beneficial agreement; in exchange for supply of food and technical goods SCP-5240 provides the Foundation a wide assortment of amnestics and accepts requests to release vast quantities of \"Ennui\"- and \"Global\"-class programmable substances into the atmosphere. A two-way communication device was assembled to that purpose, which is used by SCP-5240 to relay schedules of required produce and by the Foundation to request delivery of amnestics. Despite lack of knowledge pertaining to the object's location, mutual delivery chains have been established and operate without de-masking SCP-5240. The agreement also lists a non-interference clause, in accordance with which the Foundation does not perform active search for the object, and the object acts upon the Foundation's requests to release amnestics without objection.</p>\n<p>To enhance mutual trust and to alleviate any technical difficulties, SCP-5240 has allowed a single Foundation representative to enter its territory - logistics specialist Alfred Bruske. The subject has been allowed to send service correspondence and photographs under agreement not to perform acts of industrial or other sabotage.</p>\n<p>The Foundation has only limited general intelligence pertaining to SCP-5240, acquired by Alfred Bruske:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the moniker of \"the City\" is used in common talk and official documents. Rarely the citizens mention the name \"Fehlerstadt\";</li>\n<li>the City's population count is unknown; by estimation of an agent with no prior knowledge of investigative analytics, it can be estimated at 500-650 thousand people. The size of the City's suburban regions is unknown;</li>\n<li>the City's citizens converse in German. Their cultural specificities are so negligible (imperceptible) that it is not possible to reliably attribute them to the German or any other nation;</li>\n<li>the City is located in hilly terrain; low mountains are visible on the horizon. A river flows through the object's territory. The outer perimeter of the city's developed area is lined with an abandoned and unguarded complex of engineered obstacles in the form of a concrete wall, crooked watchtowers and rows of rusted barbed wire;</li>\n<li>the City's information development, transport and other technologies are approximately in line with the middle of the XX century.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SCP-5240 has massive industrial potential by way of abundance of chemical plants chaotically dispersed throughout the City's territory. The majority of citizenry is employed in these facilities, the only function of which is production of a wide spectrum of amnestic substances. Some of them are dispersed into the atmosphere in gaseous form, or into the river in liquid form. It is supposed that such measures are required for the City in order to maintain concealment of its existence from the worldwide community, to protect itself against diplomatic pressure (or military intervention), and to halt outwards cultural expansion.</p>\n<p>The chemical plants are supplied by large produce storage sites, as well as interlinked with a branching network of large and small pipes that route through the entirety of the City: along streets, above houses, through buildings and apartments (some heated precursors are used as conductors for central heating systems). SCP-5240's metro system is likewise adapted to the needs of the industrial complex. The metro and above-ground rail lines connect all the main amnestic factories; stations are named after the neighbouring chemical plants (\"Combine \u21167\", \"Factory \u211616\" etc.; the only exception is the \"Ministry\" station).</p>\n<p>The medium industry and car manufacture work in the interest of the chemical sector. Only a small portion of the City's factories creates consumer goods, which is why the society of SCP-5240 experiences a perpetual deficit. More than half of consumer labels are distributed under directive.</p>\n<p>Ubiquitous factory exhaust pipes are always in use, creating multicoloured smog and scented fog; constant leaks from overused pipelines and factory accidents additionally worsen the ecological situation. SCP-5240's citizenry is unanimously afflicted with respiratory illnesses.</p>\n<p>Periodically, in accordance with the Ministry's schedule (or by the Foundation's request), a \"dispersal event\" is announced in SCP-5240. The City's siren and loudspeaker system is activated, warning the citizens about the time and duration of the event, the amnestic used and the prescribed order of actions for personal protection.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup> The object's citizens always carry a bag with a gas mask and a set of filters in their possession, every person learns the names of all amnestics, their composition, locale of production, approximate production cycle structure, identification and counteraction measures by heart. The standard citizen rations include a mnestics package distributed in the form of drag\u00e9 pellets and dissoluble powders.</p>\n<p>SCP-5240 maintains a set of outdated (but never repealed) restrictions on its territory, enforced by \"the Central Department for City Rasure\" (Stadtvergessenheitshauptamt, SVHA). Despite the citizenry's lack of memory regarding the cause for such restrictions, the following items are prohibited within Fehlerstadt: historical photographs and portraits of people, documentary movies, diaries, biographies and books on history, antiquities, weapons, blazons, flags, any and all recording or retelling of information regarding the City's \"previous epoch\", as well as overall interest to it. The citizens are neutral in regards to the restrictions, and abide by them habitually with no resistance. The rare violators are reported by their peers and neighbours to the SVHA. Restricted items are burned in pyres, found criminals are permanently taken away in an unknown direction. All of the City's monuments, memorials, bas-reliefs and other historic cites have been destroyed.</p>\n<p>Alfred Bruske's official reports are under classification code \"Clearance level 5\". Below are some of the agent's personal letters, sent to his direct manager and Foundation colleagues:</p>\n<script src=\"https://d3g0gp89917ko0.cloudfront.net/v--291054f06006/common--javascript/yahooui/tabview-min.js\" type=\"text/javascript\">\n</script>\n<div class=\"yui-navset\" id=\"wiki-tabview-3ad513a3eb23aef07023ce615b54fe8a\">\n<ul class=\"yui-nav\">\n<li class=\"selected\"><a href=\"javascript:;\"><em>1</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"javascript:;\"><em>4</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"javascript:;\"><em>6</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"javascript:;\"><em>8</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"javascript:;\"><em>12</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"javascript:;\"><em>16</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"javascript:;\"><em>27</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"javascript:;\"><em>35</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"javascript:;\"><em>47</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"javascript:;\"><em>51</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"javascript:;\"><em>52</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"javascript:;\"><em>54</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"javascript:;\"><em>55</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"javascript:;\"><em>Truth</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"javascript:;\"><em>???</em></a></li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"yui-content\">\n<div id=\"wiki-tab-0-0\">\n<div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">\n\n<p>#1 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>This morning I awoke not in my bed in Zone 16, but in a small flat with a very old-timey outfit. It was dark, and rain drummed loudly out the window. I barely managed to find the switch to the lamp by touch, and turn it on. Two tall men in dark leather coats appeared from the darkness. One of them spoke in German and presented himself as my \"curator\". I almost thought that I've been captured by the Stasi Section XXV, but no, I've been briefed on the matter: I am on the grounds of some city concealed from public eyes, and I represent the SCP Foundation in the matters of developing mutual arrangements in the chemical sector. I am to relay cursory information about production of some sort of chemicals in this city, and I am to negotiate delivery of equipment and metalworks. So I've been made an ambassador of sorts and allowed to send private letters to the Foundation once per day under condition that I will not blatantly spy on them. All my questions about how I ended up here and who even sanctioned this in the first place remained unanswered. One of the tall men said that I will need to undergo prolonged acclimatization to the city's conditions, then they had me take a couple pills and go back to sleep.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"wiki-tab-0-1\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">\n\n<p>#4 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>It's been three days now\u2026 They've finally graced me with permission to go outside. I am indeed sickly, the air is just filled with all manners of smells that cause anything from vomit reflexes to absolute bliss. Depends on which way the wind's blowing.</p>\n<p>Occasionally I'm down with dry cough. The air in this place is almost visible on occasion, it hangs like smoke. Today it's kinda violet.</p>\n<p>It's a truly fascinating view. I've observed the City only through a murky window up until now, and saw only dense rows of apartment buildings with uncountable factory pipes belching many-coloured wisps of smoke between them. The streets are thoroughly shadowed by massive cistern towers lined with carcasses of ladder and walkway. Clouds hang low in the sky, shimmering with rainbow hues like spilled kerosene on asphalt. And there's pipes. Pipelines, pipelines, pipelines. Valves, throttles, bell cranks, four-ways. They're everywhere here. The network of pipes is like a multileveled web hanging above the streets and the dwellings, it enters directly into homes, my own bed stands on one such pipe. Sometimes, here or there, thin white streams breach out of them. My curator said that's just working gas from the overworked pneumatic system and that there's nothing to worry about - amnestic leaks are rather rare.</p>\n<p>Amnestics. Yes, I heard that right. That's what they produce in such enormous volume that it'd be enough to coat the whole globe in rainbow clouds. What the best minds of the Foundation spent a decade on and what we produce in such precious little quantity is mass-produced here. And that's not all. The local amnestics exceed all comparison with ours. They are more stable, more effective, their duration can be varied, their effects - programmed. It's obvious some anomalous tech it involved. The curator told me that the Foundation will receive it all at its disposal in exchange for providing goods that I, as a logistics specialist, will need to arrange. A small price to pay for such possibilities, isn't that so?</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"wiki-tab-0-2\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">\n\n<p>#6 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>I've been assigned a separate office in the Ministry. Every day I rise at 6\u00a0o'clock, drag through the pink mist and get on the metro on the \"Combine \u21166\". It's only two stations' ride away from the Ministry, but there's plenty of time to have a good look at the locals. Ashen-grey stares and rough skin, worker overalls often stained or burnt by chemicals. The people mostly talk trifle, usually discussing their colleagues and their quotas. There's something strange in their language, though, I can't figure out what. They speak seemingly normal German, but their way of speaking is unnatural. As if there's something missing. As if something's been removed.</p>\n<p>Oh, and food at home's all out, I was given meal tickets. Very generous, by the way, compared to the locals' rations. I feel sort of guilty spending them all in one place, and I don't want to attract attention, so I do my shopping in pieces all over the place - and I get to walk the City along the way. This is it - the socialist utopia. Are you sure I'm not in the GDR? No, it's far too backwards - no Trabants, no Spreewaldgurkens. None of the products have labels or names or colourful packaging. Only \"Beer\", only \"Porridge\", only \"Flour\". No salt at all, by the way, but there's plenty of matches. Oh, and the rations include mnestics, and I get them in extra large supply. According to what the cashier from one of the shops under a giant rusted pipe told me off the record, the nearby \"Combine \u21166\" is a record holder when it comes to monthly amnestic and precursor spill accidents. That's why the populace are given these pills. And they take them all the time, for the City has planned dispersals, too. And who knows what else is in the air, anyhow.</p>\n<p>Ah, something else. Had an interesting situation happen to me today. I had to pass a medical check-up against symptoms of chemical poisoning. The nurse asked me for my date of birth, and I replied. Then she picked up the phone, called into the \"Ministry Information Department\", and asked to give her today's date. Once she got it, she put my birth date and today's date into a special brass arithmometer, which handed out my age after a few cranks of the handle. In years, precision down to a tenth. \"Why?\" - I asked. - \"I could've just told you my age myself\". \"Really?\" - the woman replied in surprise, - \"That's just amazing. Oh well - we always do this, no big deal.\"</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"wiki-tab-0-3\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">\n\n<p>#8 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>Everything's going fine, overall. We've designed a way of exchanging produce that would technologically satisfy the City and keep its location in secret at the same time. The first batch of chemical component canisters has arrived from outside - soon they will be emptied, deactivated, and filled with freshly made amnestics. The headquarters requested aerosol and liquid compounds of limited effective duration, a few days, for a first test run. If this stuff passes field testing, the Foundation will begin buying it en masse immediately. Injections costing upwards of thousands of dollars? Forget that. We'll be able to cover whole settlements in months, maybe in weeks. And yes, I'm currently in talks about using their mass atmospheric amnestic dispersal systems. It's too early to say anything about that, though.</p>\n<p>Other than designing deliveries, I've started to work on amnestic and mnestic classificators. It's a very important project, I think, because the City produces - think about it - 63 different types of amnestics and 27 types of mnestics. All of those are produced in different forms - pills, gasses, liquids. All of them have different effects, storage, usage and safety requirements\u2026 It's a lot of work, in short. Strangely enough, the local specialists live just fine without any classification or guidance. Or not even specialists - ordinary people! There was a boy riding by me on a bike with a toy gas mask on his hip - in response to my simple question about where his father worked he spouted out half the production queue of four different short-term amnestics! He'd tell me more if men in black hadn't arrived out of nowhere to guide him home. It turned out they were agents of the SVHA - a local special service whose purpose is to not only maintain law and order, but, as my curator explained, \"to prevent recollection poisoning\". I have no idea what that could mean.</p>\n<p>Weird folk. Amnestics are a sort of national idea for them.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"wiki-tab-0-4\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">\n\n<p>#12 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>Stable food supply lines have been established. Already, thanks to the Foundation, the city has cancelled tickets for bread and meat, and a few more types of goods are planned in the future.</p>\n<p>The citizens' leisure comes in the form of pubs and clubs, where they consume alcohol in abundance, play cards and watch the only TV channel available. Conversations revolve around the everyday grind. I've decided to exchange a few words with the local workers in one of those places, find out how they like living without meat tickets. What do you know? Nobody even remembered tickets were a thing despite having to stand in queues only a week ago.</p>\n<p>And there it got to me. Now I understand what I've found so odd in their speech. It's difficult to formulate, their manner of speaking is entirely different. Basically, they actively avoid any lexical constructions that have so much as a tint of past tense. There's no \"was\", only \"is\", \"now\", \"always\". They don't think of the past, don't talk about the past, don't perceive the past, don't use it as a foundation to compare to the present.</p>\n<p>There is a very unique relation to time here. As in, there is none. The passage of time is only remembered when it is really necessary. Usually that entails duration of chemical processes, issues of pension and so on. They have no calendars. The City lacks any and all celebrations or days off, official or not. No New Year's, no Christmas, no birthdays. And every time I ask \"What day of the week is it?\", I always receive the answer \"Monday\".</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"wiki-tab-0-5\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">\n\n<p>#16 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>Today I got hit by a dispersal event for the first time.</p>\n<p>Back on my first day I was given a bag with a gas mask and a collection of 8 small filters with differently-coloured markings. Occasionally, in one district or another, they held mock dispersal events or combine accidents. The people ran here and there, put on gas masks, put the \"poisoned\" under IV drips. They came up to me, too. \"Citizen, there's an accident involving Berhin-C at \"Combine \u21166\", you are poisoned and have lost the capacity for long-term memory.\" All of that was moreso amusing to me. These events happened far too often. Still, I couldn't help but admire the precision and coordination of these people in an emergency.</p>\n<p>And there it was for real, this time. Sirens roared up everywhere, loudspeakers on the lampposts started reading through the dispersal message in a raspy voice. I fumbled, not knowing what to do. While everyone grabbed their gas masks and started looking for the right filters, I just stood there and stared, fascinated. Then everyone ran for the metro, and a person from the SVHA ran to me and started shouting something like \"Are you mad? Mask on, magenta filter, right now! Run for the metro!\". The agent grabbed me by the arm and dragged me to the nearest station's vestibule. In the meanwhile, everything around started vibrating ever so slightly, a rumbling hum emanated from the pipes, it felt like the tension in the system was about to rip it apart from the inside. But no, none of that happened. 15 minutes later, with a quiet pop and a long, pangent roar, the dispersal went off. Everything quieted down, while we had to remain underground for two hours more until the all-clear.</p>\n<p>When I returned home, I saw how my downstairs neighbour casually went to the lady across from me, as if there was his home. And he remained there overnight, even though his wife and two kids lived a flight below there. Something tells me this dim mechanic from the third combine isn't having sordid affairs, but just forgets where and with whom he lives. Or maybe he doesn't care. I don't know. Nobody chases him off, regardless.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"wiki-tab-0-6\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">\n\n<p>#27 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>My negotiations have successfully concluded and I've been permitted to the holiest place of all - into the dispersal control centre, up atop the tower of Combine \u21161 - the oldest of the City, from the looks of it. A test dispersal was to happen on request from the Foundation. A functional compound, but the only program imprinted upon it was memory deletion from those who would register it in air tests (aside from the Foundation, of course). A dud designed to test the effectiveness of the procedure.</p>\n<p>We spent a lot of time rising in an old-timey manual elevator among brown-old metallic constructions and finally ended up in a spacious room, filled to the brim with levers, pipes, manometers and buttons. A giant schematic of the city resided on the far wall, dotted with different blinking lights representing the chemical plants. The operators took their positions and waited in place.</p>\n<p>Ten minutes later, after a short alarm, an automatic typing machine whirred horridly and dispensed a paper with a filled out dispersal request log from the Foundation. The shift foreman ripped out half of it (with the amnestic program), signed it and threw it into the pneumatic mail. I'll try to describe all the dialogues on the \"bridge\" from memory from here on (with approximate numbers, of course):</p>\n<p>- Dispersal request! Class \"T\", fuliruline, 1700 tonnes per hour, 15 minutes, height - 13 kilometers! Calculate dispersal readiness! Calculate meteorological conditions! Test gas feed into the atmosphere!</p>\n<p>People began running around in a rush, some clacked their counting machines, some started making phone calls, some began studying the weather station readings, some selectively called different combines and information bureaus. The operators pressed different buttons with dutiful expressions.</p>\n<p>- Fuliruline stores satisfactory, Combines 1, 4, 7, 9, as well as Storage Sites 8, 9, 10, 12 and 16 all stand ready for dispersal! - an employee reported.</p>\n<p>- Atmospheric conditions satisfactory, wind is N-N-W, 7 metres per second, surface-level pressure is 757 milimetres of mercury, temperature is 17 degrees Celcius, working height pressure is 120 milimetres of mercury, temperature is -56 degrees Celicus! All parameters meet fuliruline use requirements! - the weather station worker reported.</p>\n<p>- CHPP 1, CHPP 2, CHPP 3! Dispersal systems operating normally, ready to provide working pressure to the system, - a rasping voice called out from the radio station.</p>\n<p>- Beginning dispersal procedure, proceed with performing operations according to checklist! - the foreman commanded.</p>\n<p>- Declare emergency! \u2013 the foreman assistant read out the first point of the list. The worker at the panel pressed a few buttons and began reading out the warning text into the microphone. Sirens started blaring throughout the City. The citizens, not much more than small black dots from so far up above, began scattering in all directions.</p>\n<p>- Emergency in effect!</p>\n<p>- Working shift, put on your masks! Teal filter! \u2013 shouted the assistant, and a minute later everyone looked at each other through mask lenses.</p>\n<p>- Check channel functionality!</p>\n<p>- Leak in pipeline 271-A, ordering to use pipeline 271-B! Pressure critical in cistern 67, failure of both throttles, ordering to vent and redirecting to Combine \u21161.</p>\n<p>Dozens of manometers and sensors came to life on the walls, their readings climbing up monotonously. One after another, control lamps began to light up.</p>\n<p>- System pressure at 40%! Pumping amnestic now! \u2013 reported an employee, having turned away from the gas-discharge indicator.</p>\n<p>- Test civil service readiness! \u2013 the foreman's assistant went down the line.</p>\n<p>- Evacuation underway, all ill persons, the children and the elderly are secure in basement shelters. All executives are at their posts.</p>\n<p>- Test amnestic program!</p>\n<p>- Program ready!</p>\n<p>- System pressure at 60%! Feeding programmable fuliruline precursor!</p>\n<p>The pipes began shaking noticeably. The manometer arrows climbed into the red. A low monotonous hum pressed down on the ears, even the thick gas mask offered no protection.</p>\n<p>- Test control line closure!</p>\n<p>- Line is closed! No disruptions present!</p>\n<p>- System pressure at 80%! Decision point!</p>\n<p>- Continue!</p>\n<p>The floor began shaking intensely, thin trails of whitewash flaked off from above. The City outside was covered in hundreds of small vapor trails, erupting here and there from the runoff valves.</p>\n<p>- Readiness report! \u2013 the assistant shouted into the radio. The receiver screeched voices in response.</p>\n<p>- Combine 1 ready!</p>\n<p>- Combine 4 ready!</p>\n<p>- Combine 7 ready!</p>\n<p>- Combine 9 ready!</p>\n<p>- Storage Sites 8, 9, 10, 12, 16 ready!</p>\n<p>- System pressure 100%! Amnestic has been pumped, programmed and is ready for use, - the assistant foreman reported loudly.</p>\n<p>The whole room was shaking as if in a 6-point earthquake, the manometer arrows slammed viciously into the redlines. It was difficult to stand. The whole tableau shone with lights, several sirens and alarms struggled to overpower the low drone of overloaded pipes.</p>\n<p>Everyone present on the bridge stood at attention in silence. The foreman turned to a mysterious old man, who spent the entire procedure quietly sitting in his chair on a small pedestal.</p>\n<p>- Ready for dispersal. Awaiting your command.</p>\n<p>The man looked at the foreman, his blue-tinted gas mask glasses shining, calmly rose and approached the central control desk. After taking an unusual key hanging on a string off his neck, the stranger plugged it into the panel's keyhole and turned it. Among the hundreds of blinking lights a big one, marked \"Ready\", lit up. The panel's large metallic cover opened up, revealing a breaker lever beneath it. The man grasped the lever, cast his eyes out the window, and declared loudly:</p>\n<p>- Disperse!</p>\n<p>The whole area jolted. I failed to hold steady and fell to a knee with a painful thud against the metal floor. The manometer readings calmed down and began to slowly climb their way down, lights on the schematic dimmed one by one. Swirling violet gas rose in mighty streams into the sky from the multitudes of pipes and cisterns.</p>\n<p>My report to the Foundation today is going to be fabulous.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"wiki-tab-0-7\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">\n\n<p>#35 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>An agit-prop brigade wheeled around on the street today. An old-looking truck with medical crosses on the side and loudspeakers on the roof rallied something about \"recollection poisoning\", preliminary symptoms and methods of curing the disease (by taking amnestics, naturally). The nurses in dusty white robes handed out booklets to the passersby, and a group of SVHA agents followed, updating the worn lists of forbidden items hanging around on billboards. Some of the agents approached those standing about and asked something along the lines of \"does anything cause you sensations of vague anxiety, guilt, fear or despair\"? Those who couldn't clearly answer warranted a search. By the evening the event concluded in destruction of prohibited items. Since none such were actually found, they had to resort to a symbolic pyre of old workbooks and unneeded truss rods from a nearby construction site. People brought seats out with them and lounged about to watch the fire. Children played about noisily, playing \"SVHA\" (throwing \"prohibited\" rocks into the fire) or \"dispersal\". It seems there are celebrations in this City after all.</p>\n<p>P.S. From a conversation between a nurse and a SVHA lad I got to overhear a different name of the city - \"Fehlerstadt\", and also that the SVHA, in their line of duty, is allowed to \"remember a bit more\".</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"wiki-tab-0-8\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">\n\n<p>#47 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>The Ministry.</p>\n<p>It's interesting to observe this regime. It's a unique specimen of a decentralised bureaucratic dictatorship. Matter-of-factly, there are several leading titles with enormous privileges, but they are not actually taken by anyone, since there is no hierarchy leading up to them. There are normative acts describing the rights and duties of these roles, but there are no instructions on their appointment. The giant cabinets with oak doors on the top floors of the Ministry are empty to this day, and although cleaning is done daily, the dust gathering there does not get any less.</p>\n<p>There is no \"upper class\", no \"party\", no coalition or ruling caste. Nothing. Only a giant bureaucratic machine operating on decades-old and very rarely corrected rules and directives. Instructions. Those set the ball here, without them everything would come apart in instants. The structure of the governing system is complex and confusing, there is no familiar hierarchy \"tree\" or \"pyramid\". The links between manager and underling are interwoven, contradictory, inconsistent and often circular. It is not rare to witness mutual command (where two employees are both bosses and subordinates to each other), or cases of \"I am the boss of my boss's boss\".</p>\n<p>The career trajectory here is not a ladder but a Mobius band, tens of them, interwoven in a terrible, logic- and geometry-defying knot. Everyone always moves forward only to end up where they started. The bureaucrats climb their way up without stopping, change cabinets and titles, but their efforts are futile. In time, everyone returns to their old place from where they started, yet that won't be a failure or regression, no, it's a great achievement. They will be tapped on the shoulder, congratulated for attaining such high rank, such trust. People will reacquaint themselves with old colleagues, maybe only with a change of seats or positions. For a while. Until next time they are reassigned, until next time they part, until next time they meet.</p>\n<p>And moving back on the Mobius band is no different. Same applies here. Except you'll be berated, not congratulated. Although, even then, it's all the same.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"wiki-tab-0-9\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">\n\n<p>#51 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>Finally home, I need to write something stat</p>\n<p>I was walking down the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and suddenly found it. It was on the facade of an old house, pincushioned with pipes jotting out everywhere, but still beautiful and imposing. They tried to break it off and did a good job at it, it wouldn't have been visible at all on a cloudy day, but today the sun peeked out, the shadows fell just right and revealed this guilty secret. It was a \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Yes, it was exactly it, it's difficult to mistake these right-angle hooks for something else. There was a broken round border around it - probably an oaken wreath. While a storm of thoughts was blowing through my head, I got to a different alley. \"\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Why is it here? It shouldn't be here. It shouldn't. No. It NEEDS to be here. Why have I decided that? I don't know, but I feel it in my insides\". I then swayed, bent over in half and nearly fell, just barely caught some valve on a gas pipe. I started retching. Passersby ran over to me along with SVHA agents coming out of nowhere. Now I'm completely certain they \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 everywhere and all the time.</p>\n<p>For a fraction of a second a vision came over me, or a hallucination, rather. The faces of those around became distorted inhuman grimaces for a moment. I jolted and crawled back a bit, startled. \"What did you see? - asked one of the SVHA, - Those are primary recollection poisoning symptoms. Tell us the source and we'll destroy it\". I didn't tell them the truth. \"What are you talking about? I didn't see anything, I'm just unwell\". The agents side-eyed me, but decided not to argue and just handed out a package of amnestics \"just in case\". After coming together, I ran home post-haste to write this letter. We know for certain, now, the City was under \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. I don't know how this will affect our work. Luckily, I don't think any problems came up at all.</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"wiki-tab-0-10\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">\n\n<p>#52 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>Something horrible happened tonight.</p>\n<p>I was sleeping in my bed when I suddenly heard screams. Screams and moans of hundreds melding together into one ensemble of horror. There was a crash at the stairs, and in a moment my curator from SVHA broke into the room, bolted the door behind him and backed it up by a drawer for good measure.</p>\n<p>- It's them! Do you hear them!? IT'S THEM! \u2013 the curator spoke in a trembling voice, grabbing me by the sleeve.</p>\n<p>- Who are \"they\"?</p>\n<p>- Nobody. They don't exist. They don't! And never have! \u2013 he replied in hysteria. \u2013 But oh, how they scream!</p>\n<p>- What does that\u2026 What do they need?</p>\n<p>- They need to scream. Scream! And knock! Why scream, why knock!? - and then long shadows started flickering in the band of light under the door. The curator noticed that and began to beg, pale with fright, - Just don't let them in. Don't let them in!</p>\n<p>A pounding noise joined the unbearable chorus of screaming people. They beat on the door, so much that it felt like it was about to break off the hinges. The curator fell to the floor and covered his head with his hands. He was in convulsions, blood poured in thin streams out of his ears.</p>\n<p>I didn't know what to do. The maddening noise was not ceasing at all. To my horror, I noticed that they started beating from inside the walls. The window was my only retreat. Ready to vault off the 4th floor, I cast open the curtain and saw a thick brick wall instead of the lights of distant chemical plants. Refusing to believe my eyes, I hit it with my hand, hoping to destroy it. A white handprint remained on it. My hand somehow got stained with something greyish-yellow.</p>\n<p>- One, two, three, four\u2026 screamers banging at the door\u2026 - the SVHA man counted, barely audibly, on the floor. - Three-four, two-and-one, bring amnestics here right now.</p>\n<p>With a sharp turn I dashed to the bedside drawer, which should have still held that package of amnestics they gave in the day.</p>\n<p>- Pump the gasses faster yet, breathe it deep and just forget. Turn the valves up faster still, we won't have no judge nor king. Oh, the pink clouds floating free, take away our ennui.</p>\n<p>I grabbed the pills that I refused to drink in the evening and took them all in one gulp. My legs gave out, and I fell into darkness.</p>\n<p>Yes, it turns out that was just a dream. The whole package was where it belonged once morning came.</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"wiki-tab-0-11\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">\n\n<p>#54 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>Had nightmares again. Screams, screech of fingernails and dull thrumming from inside the walls. I woke again and again only to find that I was still dreaming and that the screaming people never went away. Only the rays of morning light woke me up for good, breaking me out of the clutches of terror. My pillow was soaked.</p>\n<p>I went there again. To the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. I saw the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 there on a building, and my nightmares began then. I felt this wouldn't end well, but at the same time it was like I was pulled there by an unseen force.</p>\n<p>As it turns out, I \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. At a distance, two \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 trail. They were \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, so I didn't spot them immediately.</p>\n<p>And so I arrived at the place. The bas-relief that shone a crooked \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, almost forgotten in our world, was shattered with something heavy and blunt. They knew. The \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 had their hand here. Either surveyed the surroundings or \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 my \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. What about my promise that my \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 would be private? I don't know if there as a reason to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 these \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 now.

Precisely that \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 of its \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 they are trying to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, throw into \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. And it's somehow connected to the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 people.</p>\n<p>I think I know a way to figure it out.

As soon as I throw this letter into the \"diplomatic pneumatic mail pipe\", I'll take the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.

I saw it! I saw everything, I know! I\u2026 what even to start with. I need to write this down even if this gets in the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.</p>\n<p>I took the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and went to bed. Then someone gently knocked on my door. I stood up, opened it just a bit, then exited to the stairway landing. What I witnessed cast me in shock. I was in endless emptiness. The whole building, the whole world was as if it was torn asunder. What was left of my home was just the room, a small portion of the stairwell platform hanging over the abyss, and a corridor of shattered walls. Everywhere, above and below, was complete blackness, filled with calmly floating fragments of broken rooms. Out of nowhere, from some invisible source, shone a bright pale light, drawing sharp shadows on the cracked tiles. And there were no pipes here.</p>\n<p>After turning around I yelped, and my scream rebounded in echo hundredfold off the emptiness. A dark figure with no eyes, ears or mouth stood by the steps. It was standing still and \"stared\" in my direction. I looked about, saw there was nowhere to run, and stepped towards it. The figure turned silently and went down the stairwell with no sound at all, and I followed it.</p>\n<p>We went along destroyed corridors lit by moonlight, only the sound of my steps breaking the silence. Sometimes I could see forgotten, dust-covered things in the wall breaches: kids' toys, baby carriages, opened books, musical instrument cases. A broken phonograph stood by one of the doors, playing some quiet tune. Sometimes I witnessed painting frames hanging on the walls, some empty, some holding weird geometric abstractions scribbled in grey strokes. On some open landings I felt a cool, soundless breeze.</p>\n<p>I don't know how much time we spent wandering the labyrinth of rooms and crooked stairs. An hour or two, maybe more? Sometimes I thought I saw the corridors we've already passed hanging overhead. My boots and trousers were white with dust kicked up in trespassing.</p>\n<p>Our journey concluded at a solid metal door. The figure quietly took a key ring with a single key off its belt and opened a massive iron lock with it. Then, this strange companion turned around and wandered off in silence. I stood there for a long time, alone, not ready to open the door and leave this strange, dreadful place.</p>\n<p>I came to senses in some bushes. It was dark around, a fresh nightly wind ran across my face. I was in the City once more, but somewhere on the outskirts, as far as I could understand by the distant lights of Combine \u21161. Strangely enough, I was fully dressed and hand some of my belongings with me. It appears that my sleepwalking led me here.</p>\n<p>I looked around and noticed a rickety fence with barbed wire and an iron sign. After feeling around for a flashlight in my pocket, I lit it up and witnessed German writing: \"Warning! Extremely high level of recollection poisoning!\" I recognised that I ended up at some important site and hid myself, waiting to be found by guards. After a few minutes of wait and a walk down the fence, however, I realized that I'm alone. Somehow, in my sleep, I was able to evade the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 waiting for me on the streets.</p>\n<p>Then something clanked on my belt, and I caught that same ring with a key that the figure in my vision held. A few moments later I found the door of a warehouse for it, set into a high stone wall. The writing \u00ab<a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/morgenstern\">Morgenstern</a>\u00bb was engraved upon it along with the number \"44\". With a strained creak the lock opened, and I was able to enter the pitch-black room.</p>\n<p>I couldn't see anything with my eyes. A stale odour hit my nostrils - nobody's been here for a very long time. I walked forward in uncertainty and did my best to listen, unwilling to turn on the light. After about twenty steps I hit a pile of something metallic and caused it to loudly clatter over the floor. There was no use hiding then. I turned the flashlight on.</p>\n<p>Out of the dark I saw the edge of a giant, about thrice my own height, pile of empty metal cans, akin to paint cans. My errant kick caused the side of that pile to slide. I bent down and picked one of the cans up. After raising it to my eyes, I tried to read the half-rotten label with a skull and crossbones.</p>\n<p>\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588.</p>\n<p>Immediately, I cast the can away as far as I could, causing another stream of noises, and rubbed my hands off on the legs. Blood began pulsing fervently in my ears, my breathing became heavy and sharp. In horror, I sent the flashlight side to side, finding more and more mounds of empty \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588 cans. The whole area was filled with them to the brim.</p>\n<p>The reserves here would've been enough to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 millions of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. That's what was produced earlier here. All the combines\u2026 They only switched to amnestics later, out of\u2026 what? Shame? Fear? To live amidst the gasses\u2026 They wanted to run, but from what or whom? From themselves? The past? \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588? Justice?</p>\n<p>And there I heard them again. Millions of voices. Moaning and gurgling in the dark. From everywhere. Some shadow blinked in the spot of light, and then the flashlight treacherously went out. I stood there, frozen, until I heard someone drop the empty cans behind my back.</p>\n<p>I ran across the City, the wind screaming in my ears. Clear air, free of the usual horrid pollution, filled my lungs. The answer was far too much for me to bear. I'll write this letter, I'll send it into the mail pipe, then take my amnestics and let it be as it may. Take \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"wiki-tab-0-14\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">\n<p>I'm better now.<br/>\nI've been found unconscious by our colleagues at SVHA.

The duty shift of the primary normalcy monitoring centre \"Global-0\" has the right to use said device in critical situations (VEDIST level 1) [[footnote]]VEil DISruption Threat-1: Global leak and universal state of emergency. Preparation to launch the Ennui Protocol.[[/footnote]]. The messages are to be relayed according to the rules described in the logbook manual attached to the communication device.\n\nThe location of SCP-5240 is unknown. In accordance with established treaties the Foundation is to make no attempt to locate the object. On accidental discovery of SCP-5240 Foundation personnel is to immediately report all acquired information up the command chain; no additional investigation and personal action pertaining to the object is permitted. Due to limited access to the SCP-5240 dossier, all responsible parties are only provided information outlined in this paragraph of the Special Containment Procedures as well as Addendum 4 [[footnote]] outlining the key triggers that allow to concretely identify SCP-5240 with minimal elucidation of the object's qualities [[/footnote]]. On object discovery the Special Containment Procedures will be reevaluated by decision of the O5 Council.\n\n\n\n--A Foundation representative is present in the premises of SCP-5240.-- The fact of the Foundation representative's existence/loyalty is currently under question.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-5240 is a socio-political formation existing in the form of a \"city-state\". The object's distinction lies in complete lack of information pertaining to it in any historical or contemporary records. This is achieved by widespread use of anomalously programmed chemical agents causing varied effects of amnesia and altered cognition.\n\n\n\nOn \u2588\u2588.\u2588\u2588.19\u2588\u2588 the object came into contact with the Foundation in person on one of its former operating frequencies and offered a mutually beneficial agreement; in exchange for supply of food and technical goods SCP-5240 provides the Foundation a wide assortment of amnestics and accepts requests to release vast quantities of \"Ennui\"- and \"Global\"-class programmable substances into the atmosphere. A two-way communication device was assembled to that purpose, which is used by SCP-5240 to relay schedules of required produce and by the Foundation to request delivery of amnestics. Despite lack of knowledge pertaining to the object's location, mutual delivery chains have been established and operate without de-masking SCP-5240. The agreement also lists a non-interference clause, in accordance with which the Foundation does not perform active search for the object, and the object acts upon the Foundation's requests to release amnestics without objection.\n\n\n\nTo enhance mutual trust and to alleviate any technical difficulties, SCP-5240 has allowed a single Foundation representative to enter its territory - logistics specialist Alfred Bruske. The subject has been allowed to send service correspondence and photographs under agreement not to perform acts of industrial or other sabotage.\n\n\n\nThe Foundation has only limited general intelligence pertaining to SCP-5240, acquired by Alfred Bruske:\n\n\n\n* the moniker of \"the City\" is used in common talk and official documents. Rarely the citizens mention the name \"Fehlerstadt\";\n\n* the City's population count is unknown; by estimation of an agent with no prior knowledge of investigative analytics, it can be estimated at 500-650 thousand people. The size of the City's suburban regions is unknown;\n\n* the City's citizens converse in German. Their cultural specificities are so negligible (imperceptible) that it is not possible to reliably attribute them to the German or any other nation;\n\n* the City is located in hilly terrain; low mountains are visible on the horizon. A river flows through the object's territory. The outer perimeter of the city's developed area is lined with an abandoned and unguarded complex of engineered obstacles in the form of a concrete wall, crooked watchtowers and rows of rusted barbed wire;\n\n* the City's information development, transport and other technologies are approximately in line with the middle of the XX century.\n\n\n\nSCP-5240 has massive industrial potential by way of abundance of chemical plants chaotically dispersed throughout the City's territory. The majority of citizenry is employed in these facilities, the only function of which is production of a wide spectrum of amnestic substances. Some of them are dispersed into the atmosphere in gaseous form, or into the river in liquid form. It is supposed that such measures are required for the City in order to maintain concealment of its existence from the worldwide community, to protect itself against diplomatic pressure (or military intervention), and to halt outwards cultural expansion.\n\n\n\nThe chemical plants are supplied by large produce storage sites, as well as interlinked with a branching network of large and small pipes that route through the entirety of the City: along streets, above houses, through buildings and apartments (some heated precursors are used as conductors for central heating systems). SCP-5240's metro system is likewise adapted to the needs of the industrial complex. The metro and above-ground rail lines connect all the main amnestic factories; stations are named after the neighbouring chemical plants (\"Combine \u21167\", \"Factory \u211616\" etc.; the only exception is the \"Ministry\" station).\n\n\n\nThe medium industry and car manufacture work in the interest of the chemical sector. Only a small portion of the City's factories creates consumer goods, which is why the society of SCP-5240 experiences a perpetual deficit.\u00a0\u00a0More than half of consumer labels are distributed under directive.\n\n\n\nUbiquitous factory exhaust pipes are always in use, creating multicoloured smog and scented fog; constant leaks from overused pipelines and factory accidents additionally worsen the ecological situation. SCP-5240's citizenry is unanimously afflicted with respiratory illnesses.\n\n\n\nPeriodically, in accordance with the Ministry's schedule (or by the Foundation's request), a \"dispersal event\" is announced in SCP-5240. The City's siren and loudspeaker system is activated, warning the citizens about the time and duration of the event, the amnestic used and the prescribed order of actions for personal protection. [[footnote]] Example of a typical \"dispersal event\" alert: \"Warning! Following is a message from the Ministry's announcement department. Citizens! The City declares a dispersal event! Period of dispersal: 18:30 to 18:45, amnestic - berhin, blue gas with strong garlic odour, lighter than air. Equip your gas masks with yellow marking ribbons. Repeat: yellow marking ribbons. Vacate the rooftops and upper floors of buildings. Act according to instruction until the \"all-clear\" signal. Refrain from harvesting crops from trees and ground plots for the following two days.\" The message repeats. [[/footnote]] The object's citizens always carry a bag with a gas mask and a set of filters in their possession, every person learns the names of all amnestics, their composition, locale of production, approximate production cycle structure, identification and counteraction measures by heart. The standard citizen rations include a mnestics package distributed in the form of drag\u00e9 pellets and dissoluble powders.\n\n\n\nSCP-5240 maintains a set of outdated (but never repealed) restrictions on its territory, enforced by \"the Central Department for City Rasure\" (Stadtvergessenheitshauptamt, SVHA). Despite the citizenry's lack of memory regarding the cause for such restrictions, the following items are prohibited within Fehlerstadt: historical photographs and portraits of people, documentary movies, diaries, biographies and books on history, antiquities, weapons, blazons, flags, any and all recording or retelling of information regarding the City's \"previous epoch\", as well as overall interest to it. The citizens are neutral in regards to the restrictions, and abide by them habitually with no resistance. The rare violators are reported by their peers and neighbours to the SVHA. Restricted items are burned in pyres, found criminals are permanently taken away in an unknown direction. All of the City's monuments, memorials, bas-reliefs and other historic cites have been destroyed.\n\n\n\nAlfred Bruske's official reports are under classification code \"Clearance level 5\". Below are some of the agent's personal letters, sent to his direct manager and Foundation colleagues:\n\n\n\n[[tabview]]\n\n[[tab 1]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\"]]\n\n\n\n[[>image stamp.png size=\"thumbnail\"]]\n\n#1 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\nThis morning I awoke not in my bed in Zone 16, but in a small flat with a very old-timey outfit. It was dark, and rain drummed loudly out the window. I barely managed to find the switch to the lamp by touch, and turn it on. Two tall men in dark leather coats appeared from the darkness. One of them spoke in German and presented himself as my \"curator\". I almost thought that I've been captured by the Stasi Section XXV, but no, I've been briefed on the matter: I am on the grounds of some city concealed from public eyes, and I represent the SCP Foundation in the matters of developing mutual arrangements in the chemical sector. I am to relay cursory information about production of some sort of chemicals in this city, and I am to negotiate delivery of equipment and metalworks. So I've been made an ambassador of sorts and allowed to send private letters to the Foundation once per day under condition that I will not blatantly spy on them. All my questions about how I ended up here and who even sanctioned this in the first place remained unanswered. One of the tall men said that I will need to undergo prolonged acclimatization to the city's conditions, then they had me take a couple pills and go back to sleep.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n\n\n[[tab 4]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\"]]\n\n\n\n[[>image stamp.png size=\"thumbnail\"]]\n\n\n\n#4 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\nIt's been three days now... They've finally graced me with permission to go outside. I am indeed sickly, the air is just filled with all manners of smells that cause anything from vomit reflexes to absolute bliss. Depends on which way the wind's blowing.\n\n\n\nOccasionally I'm down with dry cough. The air in this place is almost visible on occasion, it hangs like smoke. Today it's kinda violet.\n\n\n\nIt's a truly fascinating view. I've observed the City only through a murky window up until now, and saw only dense rows of apartment buildings with uncountable factory pipes belching many-coloured wisps of smoke between them. The streets are thoroughly shadowed by massive cistern towers lined with carcasses of ladder and walkway. Clouds hang low in the sky, shimmering with rainbow hues like spilled kerosene on asphalt. And there's pipes. Pipelines, pipelines, pipelines. Valves, throttles, bell cranks, four-ways. They're everywhere here. The network of pipes is like a multileveled web hanging above the streets and the dwellings, it enters directly into homes, my own bed stands on one such pipe. Sometimes, here or there, thin white streams breach out of them. My curator said that's just working gas from the overworked pneumatic system and that there's nothing to worry about - amnestic leaks are rather rare.\n\n\n\nAmnestics. Yes, I heard that right. That's what they produce in such enormous volume that it'd be enough to coat the whole globe in rainbow clouds. What the best minds of the Foundation spent a decade on and what we produce in such precious little quantity is mass-produced here. And that's not all. The local amnestics exceed all comparison with ours. They are more stable, more effective, their duration can be varied, their effects - programmed. It's obvious some anomalous tech it involved. The curator told me that the Foundation will receive it all at its disposal in exchange for providing goods that I, as a logistics specialist, will need to arrange. A small price to pay for such possibilities, isn't that so?\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n\n\n[[tab 6]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\"]]\n\n[[>image stamp.png size=\"thumbnail\"]]\n\n#6 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\nI've been assigned a separate office in the Ministry. Every day I rise at 6 o'clock, drag through the pink mist and get on the metro on the \"Combine \u21166\". It's only two stations' ride away from the Ministry, but there's plenty of time to have a good look at the locals. Ashen-grey stares and rough skin, worker overalls often stained or burnt by chemicals. The people mostly talk trifle, usually discussing their colleagues and their quotas. There's something strange in their language, though, I can't figure out what. They speak seemingly normal German, but their way of speaking is unnatural. As if there's something missing. As if something's been removed. \n\n\n\nOh, and food at home's all out, I was given meal tickets. Very generous, by the way, compared to the locals' rations. I feel sort of guilty spending them all in one place, and I don't want to attract attention, so I do my shopping in pieces all over the place - and I get to walk the City along the way. This is it - the socialist utopia. Are you sure I'm not in the GDR? No, it's far too backwards - no Trabants, no Spreewaldgurkens. None of the products have labels or names or colourful packaging. Only \"Beer\", only \"Porridge\", only \"Flour\". No salt at all, by the way, but there's plenty of matches. Oh, and the rations include mnestics, and I get them in extra large supply. According to what the cashier from one of the shops under a giant rusted pipe told me off the record, the nearby \"Combine \u21166\" is a record holder when it comes to monthly amnestic and precursor spill accidents. That's why the populace are given these pills. And they take them all the time, for the City has planned dispersals, too. And who knows what else is in the air, anyhow. \n\n\n\nAh, something else. Had an interesting situation happen to me today. I had to pass a medical check-up against symptoms of chemical poisoning. The nurse asked me for my date of birth, and I replied. Then she picked up the phone, called into the \"Ministry Information Department\", and asked to give her today's date. Once she got it, she put my birth date and today's date into a special brass arithmometer, which handed out my age after a few cranks of the handle. In years, precision down to a tenth. \"Why?\" - I asked. - \"I could've just told you my age myself\". \"Really?\" - the woman replied in surprise, - \"That's just amazing. Oh well - we always do this, no big deal.\"\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[tab 8]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\"]]\n\n[[>image stamp.png size=\"thumbnail\"]]\n\n#8 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\nEverything's going fine, overall. We've designed a way of exchanging produce that would technologically satisfy the City and keep its location in secret at the same time. The first batch of chemical component canisters has arrived from outside - soon they will be emptied, deactivated, and filled with freshly made amnestics. The headquarters requested aerosol and liquid compounds of limited effective duration, a few days, for a first test run. If this stuff passes field testing, the Foundation will begin buying it en masse immediately. Injections costing upwards of thousands of dollars? Forget that. We'll be able to cover whole settlements in months, maybe in weeks. And yes, I'm currently in talks about using their mass atmospheric amnestic dispersal systems. It's too early to say anything about that, though.\n\n\n\nOther than designing deliveries, I've started to work on amnestic and mnestic classificators. It's a very important project, I think, because the City produces - think about it - 63 different types of amnestics and 27 types of mnestics. All of those are produced in different forms - pills, gasses, liquids. All of them have different effects, storage, usage and safety requirements... It's a lot of work, in short. Strangely enough, the local specialists live just fine without any classification or guidance. Or not even specialists - ordinary people! There was a boy riding by me on a bike with a toy gas mask on his hip - in response to my simple question about where his father worked he spouted out half the production queue of four different short-term amnestics! He'd tell me more if men in black hadn't arrived out of nowhere to guide him home. It turned out they were agents of the SVHA - a local special service whose purpose is to not only maintain law and order, but, as my curator explained, \"to prevent recollection poisoning\". I have no idea what that could mean.\n\n\n\nWeird folk. Amnestics are a sort of national idea for them.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n\n\n[[tab 12]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\"]]\n\n[[>image stamp.png size=\"thumbnail\"]]\n\n#12 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\nStable food supply lines have been established. Already, thanks to the Foundation, the city has cancelled tickets for bread and meat, and a few more types of goods are planned in the future.\n\n\n\nThe citizens' leisure comes in the form of pubs and clubs, where they consume alcohol in abundance, play cards and watch the only TV channel available. Conversations revolve around the everyday grind. I've decided to exchange a few words with the local workers in one of those places, find out how they like living without meat tickets. What do you know? Nobody even remembered tickets were a thing despite having to stand in queues only a week ago.\n\n\n\nAnd there it got to me. Now I understand what I've found so odd in their speech. It's difficult to formulate, their manner of speaking is entirely different. Basically, they actively avoid any lexical constructions that have so much as a tint of past tense. There's no \"was\", only \"is\", \"now\", \"always\". They don't think of the past, don't talk about the past, don't perceive the past, don't use it as a foundation to compare to the present.\n\n\n\nThere is a very unique relation to time here. As in, there is none. The passage of time is only remembered when it is really necessary. Usually that entails duration of chemical processes, issues of pension and so on. They have no calendars. The City lacks any and all celebrations or days off, official or not. No New Year's, no Christmas, no birthdays. And every time I ask \"What day of the week is it?\", I always receive the answer \"Monday\". \n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[tab 16]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\"]]\n\n[[>image stamp.png size=\"thumbnail\"]]\n\n#16 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\nToday I got hit by a dispersal event for the first time.\n\n\n\nBack on my first day I was given a bag with a gas mask and a collection of 8 small filters with differently-coloured markings. Occasionally, in one district or another, they held mock dispersal events or combine accidents. The people ran here and there, put on gas masks, put the \"poisoned\" under IV drips. They came up to me, too. \"Citizen, there's an accident involving Berhin-C at \"Combine \u21166\", you are poisoned and have lost the capacity for long-term memory.\" All of that was moreso amusing to me. These events happened far too often. Still, I couldn't help but admire the precision and coordination of these people in an emergency.\n\n\n\nAnd there it was for real, this time. Sirens roared up everywhere, loudspeakers on the lampposts started reading through the dispersal message in a raspy voice. I fumbled, not knowing what to do. While everyone grabbed their gas masks and started looking for the right filters, I just stood there and stared, fascinated. Then everyone ran for the metro, and a person from the SVHA ran to me and started shouting something like \"Are you mad? Mask on, magenta filter, right now! Run for the metro!\". The agent grabbed me by the arm and dragged me to the nearest station's vestibule. In the meanwhile, everything around started vibrating ever so slightly, a rumbling hum emanated from the pipes, it felt like the tension in the system was about to rip it apart from the inside. But no, none of that happened. 15 minutes later, with a quiet pop and a long, pangent roar, the dispersal went off. Everything quieted down, while we had to remain underground for two hours more until the all-clear.\n\n\n\nWhen I returned home, I saw how my downstairs neighbour casually went to the lady across from me, as if there was his home. And he remained there overnight, even though his wife and two kids lived a flight below there. Something tells me this dim mechanic from the third combine isn't having sordid affairs, but just forgets where and with whom he lives. Or maybe he doesn't care. I don't know. Nobody chases him off, regardless.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[tab 27]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\"]]\n\n[[>image stamp.png size=\"thumbnail\"]]\n\n#27 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\nMy negotiations have successfully concluded and I've been permitted to the holiest place of all - into the dispersal control centre, up atop the tower of Combine \u21161 - the oldest of the City, from the looks of it. A test dispersal was to happen on request from the Foundation. A functional compound, but the only program imprinted upon it was memory deletion from those who would register it in air tests (aside from the Foundation, of course). A dud designed to test the effectiveness of the procedure.\n\n\n\nWe spent a lot of time rising in an old-timey manual elevator among brown-old metallic constructions and finally ended up in a spacious room, filled to the brim with levers, pipes, manometers and buttons. A giant schematic of the city resided on the far wall, dotted with different blinking lights representing the chemical plants. The operators took their positions and waited in place. \n\n\n\nTen minutes later, after a short alarm, an automatic typing machine whirred horridly and dispensed a paper with a filled out dispersal request log from the Foundation. The shift foreman ripped out half of it (with the amnestic program), signed it and threw it into the pneumatic mail. I'll try to describe all the dialogues on the \"bridge\" from memory from here on (with approximate numbers, of course): \n\n\n\n- Dispersal request! Class \"T\", fuliruline, 1700 tonnes per hour, 15 minutes, height - 13 kilometers! Calculate dispersal readiness! Calculate meteorological conditions! Test gas feed into the atmosphere! \n\n\n\nPeople began running around in a rush, some clacked their counting machines, some started making phone calls, some began studying the weather station readings, some selectively called different combines and information bureaus. The operators pressed different buttons with dutiful expressions.\n\n\n\n- Fuliruline stores satisfactory, Combines 1, 4, 7, 9, as well as Storage Sites 8, 9, 10, 12 and 16 all stand ready for dispersal! - an employee reported.\n\n\n\n- Atmospheric conditions satisfactory, wind is N-N-W, 7 metres per second, surface-level pressure is 757 milimetres of mercury, temperature is 17 degrees Celcius, working height pressure is 120 milimetres of mercury, temperature is -56 degrees Celicus! All parameters meet fuliruline use requirements! - the weather station worker reported. \n\n\n\n- CHPP 1, CHPP 2, CHPP 3! Dispersal systems operating normally, ready to provide working pressure to the system, - a rasping voice called out from the radio station.\n\n\n\n- Beginning dispersal procedure, proceed with performing operations according to checklist! - the foreman commanded.\n\n\n\n- Declare emergency! \u2013 the foreman assistant read out the first point of the list. The worker at the panel pressed a few buttons and began reading out the warning text into the microphone. Sirens started blaring throughout the City. The citizens, not much more than small black dots from so far up above, began scattering in all directions.\n\n\n\n- Emergency in effect!\n\n\n\n- Working shift, put on your masks! Teal filter! \u2013 shouted the assistant, and a minute later everyone looked at each other through mask lenses.\n\n\n\n- Check channel functionality!\n\n\n\n- Leak in pipeline 271-A, ordering to use pipeline 271-B! Pressure critical in cistern 67, failure of both throttles, ordering to vent and redirecting to Combine \u21161.\n\n\n\nDozens of manometers and sensors came to life on the walls, their readings climbing up monotonously. One after another, control lamps began to light up.\n\n\n\n- System pressure at 40%! Pumping amnestic now! \u2013 reported an employee, having turned away from the gas-discharge indicator.\n\n\n\n- Test civil service readiness! \u2013 the foreman's assistant went down the line.\n\n\n\n- Evacuation underway, all ill persons, the children and the elderly are secure in basement shelters. All executives are at their posts. \n\n\n\n- Test amnestic program!\n\n\n\n- Program ready!\n\n\n\n- System pressure at 60%! Feeding programmable fuliruline precursor! \n\n\n\nThe pipes began shaking noticeably. The manometer arrows climbed into the red. A low monotonous hum pressed down on the ears, even the thick gas mask offered no protection.\n\n\n\n- Test control line closure!\n\n\n\n- Line is closed! No disruptions present!\n\n\n\n- System pressure at 80%! Decision point!\n\n\n\n- Continue!\n\n\n\nThe floor began shaking intensely, thin trails of whitewash flaked off from above. The City outside was covered in hundreds of small vapor trails, erupting here and there from the runoff valves.\n\n\n\n- Readiness report! \u2013 the assistant shouted into the radio. The receiver screeched voices in response. \n\n\n\n- Combine 1 ready!\n\n\n\n- Combine 4 ready!\n\n\n\n- Combine 7 ready!\n\n\n\n- Combine 9 ready!\n\n\n\n- Storage Sites 8, 9, 10, 12, 16 ready!\n\n\n\n- System pressure 100%! Amnestic has been pumped, programmed and is ready for use, - the assistant foreman reported loudly.\n\n\n\nThe whole room was shaking as if in a 6-point earthquake, the manometer arrows slammed viciously into the redlines. It was difficult to stand. The whole tableau shone with lights, several sirens and alarms struggled to overpower the low drone of overloaded pipes.\n\n\n\nEveryone present on the bridge stood at attention in silence. The foreman turned to a mysterious old man, who spent the entire procedure quietly sitting in his chair on a small pedestal.\n\n\n\n- Ready for dispersal. Awaiting your command.\n\n\n\nThe man looked at the foreman, his blue-tinted gas mask glasses shining, calmly rose and approached the central control desk. After taking an unusual key hanging on a string off his neck, the stranger plugged it into the panel's keyhole and turned it. Among the hundreds of blinking lights a big one, marked \"Ready\", lit up. The panel's large metallic cover opened up, revealing a breaker lever beneath it. The man grasped the lever, cast his eyes out the window, and declared loudly:\n\n\n\n- Disperse!\n\n\n\nThe whole area jolted. I failed to hold steady and fell to a knee with a painful thud against the metal floor. The manometer readings calmed down and began to slowly climb their way down, lights on the schematic dimmed one by one. Swirling violet gas rose in mighty streams into the sky from the multitudes of pipes and cisterns. \n\n\n\nMy report to the Foundation today is going to be fabulous.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[tab 35]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\"]]\n\n[[>image stamp.png size=\"thumbnail\"]]\n\n#35 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\nAn agit-prop brigade wheeled around on the street today. An old-looking truck with medical crosses on the side and loudspeakers on the roof rallied something about \"recollection poisoning\", preliminary symptoms and methods of curing the disease (by taking amnestics, naturally). The nurses in dusty white robes handed out booklets to the passersby, and a group of SVHA agents followed, updating the worn lists of forbidden items hanging around on billboards. Some of the agents approached those standing about and asked something along the lines of \"does anything cause you sensations of vague anxiety, guilt, fear or despair\"? Those who couldn't clearly answer warranted a search. By the evening the event concluded in destruction of prohibited items. Since none such were actually found, they had to resort to a symbolic pyre of old workbooks and unneeded truss rods from a nearby construction site. People brought seats out with them and lounged about to watch the fire. Children played about noisily, playing \"SVHA\" (throwing \"prohibited\" rocks into the fire) or \"dispersal\". It seems there are celebrations in this City after all. \n\n\n\nP.S. From a conversation between a nurse and a SVHA lad I got to overhear a different name of the city - \"Fehlerstadt\", and also that the SVHA, in their line of duty, is allowed to \"remember a bit more\".\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[tab 47]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\"]]\n\n[[>image stamp.png size=\"thumbnail\"]]\n\n#47 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\nThe Ministry.\n\n\n\nIt's interesting to observe this regime. It's a unique specimen of a decentralised bureaucratic dictatorship. Matter-of-factly, there are several leading titles with enormous privileges, but they are not actually taken by anyone, since there is no hierarchy leading up to them. There are normative acts describing the rights and duties of these roles, but there are no instructions on their appointment. The giant cabinets with oak doors on the top floors of the Ministry are empty to this day, and although cleaning is done daily, the dust gathering there does not get any less. \n\n\n\nThere is no \"upper class\", no \"party\", no coalition or ruling caste. Nothing. Only a giant bureaucratic machine operating on decades-old and very rarely corrected rules and directives. Instructions. Those set the ball here, without them everything would come apart in instants. The structure of the governing system is complex and confusing, there is no familiar hierarchy \"tree\" or \"pyramid\". The links between manager and underling are interwoven, contradictory, inconsistent and often circular. It is not rare to witness mutual command (where two employees are both bosses and subordinates to each other), or cases of \"I am the boss of my boss's boss\".\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe career trajectory here is not a ladder but a Mobius band, tens of them, interwoven in a terrible, logic- and geometry-defying knot. Everyone always moves forward only to end up where they started. The bureaucrats climb their way up without stopping, change cabinets and titles, but their efforts are futile. In time, everyone returns to their old place from where they started, yet that won't be a failure or regression, no, it's a great achievement. They will be tapped on the shoulder, congratulated for attaining such high rank, such trust. People will reacquaint themselves with old colleagues, maybe only with a change of seats or positions. For a while. Until next time they are reassigned, until next time they part, until next time they meet.\n\n\n\nAnd moving back on the Mobius band is no different. Same applies here. Except you'll be berated, not congratulated. Although, even then, it's all the same. \n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[tab 51]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\"]]\n\n[[>image stamp.png size=\"thumbnail\"]]\n\n#51 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\nFinally home, I need to write something stat\n\n\n\nI was walking down the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and suddenly found it. It was on the facade of an old house, pincushioned with pipes jotting out everywhere, but still beautiful and imposing. They tried to break it off and did a good job at it, it wouldn't have been visible at all on a cloudy day, but today the sun peeked out, the shadows fell just right and revealed this guilty secret. It was a \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Yes, it was exactly it, it's difficult to mistake these right-angle hooks for something else. There was a broken round border around it - probably an oaken wreath. While a storm of thoughts was blowing through my head, I got to a different alley. \"\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Why is it here? It shouldn't be here. It shouldn't. No. It NEEDS to be here. Why have I decided that? I don't know, but I feel it in my insides\". I then swayed, bent over in half and nearly fell, just barely caught some valve on a gas pipe. I started retching. Passersby ran over to me along with SVHA agents coming out of nowhere. Now I'm completely certain they \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 everywhere and all the time.\n\n\n\nFor a fraction of a second a vision came over me, or a hallucination, rather. The faces of those around became distorted inhuman grimaces for a moment. I jolted and crawled back a bit, startled. \"What did you see? - asked one of the SVHA, - Those are primary recollection poisoning symptoms. Tell us the source and we'll destroy it\". I didn't tell them the truth. \"What are you talking about? I didn't see anything, I'm just unwell\". The agents side-eyed me, but decided not to argue and just handed out a package of amnestics \"just in case\". After coming together, I ran home post-haste to write this letter. We know for certain, now, the City was under \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. I don't know how this will affect our work. Luckily, I don't think any problems came up at all.\n\n\n\n[[>image stamp2.png size=\"small\"]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[tab 52]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\"]]\n\n[[>image stamp.png size=\"thumbnail\"]]\n\n#52 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\nSomething horrible happened tonight.\n\n\n\nI was sleeping in my bed when I suddenly heard screams. Screams and moans of hundreds melding together into one ensemble of horror. There was a crash at the stairs, and in a moment my curator from SVHA broke into the room, bolted the door behind him and backed it up by a drawer for good measure.\n\n\n\n- It's them! Do you hear them!? IT'S THEM! \u2013 the curator spoke in a trembling voice, grabbing me by the sleeve.\n\n\n\n- Who are \"they\"?\n\n\n\n- Nobody. They don't exist. They don't! And never have! \u2013 he replied in hysteria. \u2013 But oh, how they scream!\n\n\n\n- What does that... What do they need?\n\n\n\n- They need to scream. Scream! And knock! Why scream, why knock!? - and then long shadows started flickering in the band of light under the door. The curator noticed that and began to beg, pale with fright, - Just don't let them in. Don't let them in!\n\n\n\nA pounding noise joined the unbearable chorus of screaming people. They beat on the door, so much that it felt like it was about to break off the hinges. The curator fell to the floor and covered his head with his hands. He was in convulsions, blood poured in thin streams out of his ears.\n\n\n\nI didn't know what to do. The maddening noise was not ceasing at all. To my horror, I noticed that they started beating from inside the walls. The window was my only retreat. Ready to vault off the 4th floor, I cast open the curtain and saw a thick brick wall instead of the lights of distant chemical plants. Refusing to believe my eyes, I hit it with my hand, hoping to destroy it. A white handprint remained on it. My hand somehow got stained with something greyish-yellow. \n\n\n\n- One, two, three, four... screamers banging at the door... - the SVHA man counted, barely audibly, on the floor. - Three-four, two-and-one, bring amnestics here right now. \n\n\n\nWith a sharp turn I dashed to the bedside drawer, which should have still held that package of amnestics they gave in the day. \n\n\n\n- Pump the gasses faster yet, breathe it deep and just forget. Turn the valves up faster still, we won't have no judge nor king. Oh, the pink clouds floating free, take away our ennui. \n\n\n\nI grabbed the pills that I refused to drink in the evening and took them all in one gulp. My legs gave out, and I fell into darkness.\n\n\n\nYes, it turns out that was just a dream. The whole package was where it belonged once morning came.\n\n\n\n[[>image stamp2.png size=\"small\"]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[tab 54]]\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\"]]\n\n[[>image stamp.png size=\"thumbnail\"]]\n\n#54 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\nHad nightmares again. Screams, screech of fingernails and dull thrumming from inside the walls. I woke again and again only to find that I was still dreaming and that the screaming people never went away. Only the rays of morning light woke me up for good, breaking me out of the clutches of terror. My pillow was soaked.\n\n\n\nI went there again. To the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. I saw the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 there on a building, and my nightmares began then. I felt this wouldn't end well, but at the same time it was like I was pulled there by an unseen force.\n\n\n\nAs it turns out, I \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. At a distance, two \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 trail. They were \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, so I didn't spot them immediately.\n\n\n\nAnd so I arrived at the place. The bas-relief that shone a crooked \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, almost forgotten in our world, was shattered with something heavy and blunt. They knew. The \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 had their hand here. Either surveyed the surroundings or \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 my \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. What about my promise that my \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 would be private? I don't know if there as a reason to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 these \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 now. I don't even know if any of them ever \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588. \n\n\n\nNow I am certain that the City wasn't just a part of the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, but was integral to it. Precisely that \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 of its \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 they are trying to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, throw into \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. And it's somehow connected to the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 people. \n\n\n\nI think I know a way to figure it out. In the style of the City.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[>image stamp2.png size=\"small\"]]\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n\n\n[[tab 55]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:13px; margin-bottom: 15px;\"]]\n\n[[>image stamp.png size=\"thumbnail\"]]\n\n#55 \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\nI stole a package of an incredibly potent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 from the batch outbound for the Foundation. \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 constantly \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 outside my window, so I've decided to do everything in the night. As soon as I throw this letter into the \"diplomatic pneumatic mail pipe\", I'll take the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.

I saw it! I saw everything, I know! I... what even to start with. I need to write this down even if this gets in the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n\nI took the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and went to bed. Then someone gently knocked on my door. I stood up, opened it just a bit, then exited to the stairway landing. What I witnessed cast me in shock. I was in endless emptiness. The whole building, the whole world was as if it was torn asunder. What was left of my home was just the room, a small portion of the stairwell platform hanging over the abyss, and a corridor of shattered walls. Everywhere, above and below, was complete blackness, filled with calmly floating fragments of broken rooms. Out of nowhere, from some invisible source, shone a bright pale light, drawing sharp shadows on the cracked tiles. And there were no pipes here.\n\n\n\nAfter turning around I yelped, and my scream rebounded in echo hundredfold off the emptiness. A dark figure with no eyes, ears or mouth stood by the steps. It was standing still and \"stared\" in my direction. I looked about, saw there was nowhere to run, and stepped towards it. The figure turned silently and went down the stairwell with no sound at all, and I followed it.\n\n\n\nWe went along destroyed corridors lit by moonlight, only the sound of my steps breaking the silence. Sometimes I could see forgotten, dust-covered things in the wall breaches: kids' toys, baby carriages, opened books, musical instrument cases. A broken phonograph stood by one of the doors, playing some quiet tune. Sometimes I witnessed painting frames hanging on the walls, some empty, some holding weird geometric abstractions scribbled in grey strokes. On some open landings I felt a cool, soundless breeze.\n\n\n\nI don't know how much time we spent wandering the labyrinth of rooms and crooked stairs. An hour or two, maybe more? Sometimes I thought I saw the corridors we've already passed hanging overhead. My boots and trousers were white with dust kicked up in trespassing.\n\n\n\nOur journey concluded at a solid metal door. The figure quietly took a key ring with a single key off its belt and opened a massive iron lock with it. Then, this strange companion turned around and wandered off in silence. I stood there for a long time, alone, not ready to open the door and leave this strange, dreadful place.\n\n\n\nI came to senses in some bushes. It was dark around, a fresh nightly wind ran across my face. I was in the City once more, but somewhere on the outskirts, as far as I could understand by the distant lights of Combine \u21161. Strangely enough, I was fully dressed and hand some of my belongings with me. It appears that my sleepwalking led me here.\n\n\n\nI looked around and noticed a rickety fence with barbed wire and an iron sign. After feeling around for a flashlight in my pocket, I lit it up and witnessed German writing: \"Warning! Extremely high level of recollection poisoning!\" I recognised that I ended up at some important site and hid myself, waiting to be found by guards. After a few minutes of wait and a walk down the fence, however, I realized that I'm alone. Somehow, in my sleep, I was able to evade the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 waiting for me on the streets. \n\n\n\nThen something clanked on my belt, and I caught that same ring with a key that the figure in my vision held. A few moments later I found the door of a warehouse for it, set into a high stone wall. The writing \u00ab[[[Morgenstern]]]\u00bb was engraved upon it along with the number \"44\". With a strained creak the lock opened, and I was able to enter the pitch-black room.\n\n\n\nI couldn't see anything with my eyes. A stale odour hit my nostrils - nobody's been here for a very long time. I walked forward in uncertainty and did my best to listen, unwilling to turn on the light. After about twenty steps I hit a pile of something metallic and caused it to loudly clatter over the floor. There was no use hiding then. I turned the flashlight on.\n\n\n\nOut of the dark I saw the edge of a giant, about thrice my own height, pile of empty metal cans, akin to paint cans. My errant kick caused the side of that pile to slide. I bent down and picked one of the cans up. After raising it to my eyes, I tried to read the half-rotten label with a skull and crossbones. \n\n\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588.\n\n\n\nImmediately, I cast the can away as far as I could, causing another stream of noises, and rubbed my hands off on the legs. Blood began pulsing fervently in my ears, my breathing became heavy and sharp. In horror, I sent the flashlight side to side, finding more and more mounds of empty \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588 cans. The whole area was filled with them to the brim.\n\n\n\nThe reserves here would've been enough to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 millions of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.

Considering that non-equilibrium processes play essential roles in the sustaining of life, progression of SCP-5814 over time may cause a CC-Class \"Collapse of Chemistry\" scenario, with the result that carbon-based chemistry will no longer provide conditions suitable for life.</p>\n<p>Although the potential destructive effects of SCP-5814 has never been directly observed, studies have revealed that SCP-5814 may have initiated several CC-Class Scenarios in the past, resulting in the current ecology of the universe. Based on observations, SCP-5814 currently has limited negative impacts on carbon-based biology, but its effect will be unignorable in the time scale of millions of years.</p>\n<p>The effects of SCP-5814 within its range of influence are embodied by a specific medium, SCP-5814-A. SCP-5814-A behaves like an ideal gas physically and is speculated to be composed of a kind of previously unknown boson<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-4\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')\">4</a></sup>.

SCP-5814-A can spatially penetrate all known solids, liquids, and gases, but its effects only manifest at atomic scales. For interactions at subatomic scales, SCP-5814-A will not cause any obvious effects.</p>\n<p>SCP-5814-A's electric susceptibility anomalously increases over time. As SCP-5814-A can penetrate through all known forms of matter, changes in its electric susceptibility affect the polarity of nearby matter, increasing the macroscopic dielectric constant of causing polar materials. It is proven that the rate of change in electric susceptibility follows the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 equation. Based on theoretical computation, the current value of SCP-5814-A's electric susceptibility is \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum I.</strong> The discovery of SCP-5814</p>\n<p>In 1972, Foundation researcher Dr. Arnold Freking discovered a change in the measured speed of light in the air while reviewing earlier measurements of the speed of light. Though insignificant, the measured speed of light in air was found to have decreased in the past 100 years. This effect was shown to be more observable in water, in which the speed of light has decreased by \u2588\u2588.\u2588\u2588% in the last 100 years. Observations of other physical constants, such as measurements of the rate of nuclear reactions, have shown that speed of light in vacuum has not changed. Analysis based on observations, Hubble's law<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-6\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')\">6</a></sup>, and virial theorem<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-7\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')\">7</a></sup> has shown that an unknown medium is distributed across certain regions of the Laniakea Supercluster. This medium had a certain degree of electric susceptibility and increased the dielectric constant of polar substances such as water upon interaction.</p>\n<p>Analysis based on observed values showed that under the effects of SCP-5814-A, the speed of light observed in different media over time follows the equation c=c<sub>0</sub>\u00d7(b<sub>F</sub>+k<sub>F</sub>t)<sup>-1/2</sup>, now called Freking's law. This result implies that SCP-5814-A causes the relative dielectric constant of matter to change linearly with time. Dr. Freking deemed such phenomenon enough to declare SCP-5814 an anomaly. He reported his observation result to the Physics and Mathematics Research Institution of the Foundation (SCP-PMRI), who then classified the phenomenon on \u2588\u2588/\u2588/1980.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum II.</strong> Extract SCP-5814 research report, submitted to the Overseer Council by PMRI (\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2000)</p>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:300px;\"><img alt=\"EA\" class=\"image\" src=\"http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5814/EA\" style=\"width:300px;\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width:300px;\">\n<p>Under the effect of SCP-5814, the activation energy of some reactions will be significantly lowered, which allows the corresponding reactions to proceed at a relatively low temperature.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u2026\u2026By applying computational methods, we have proven that the cumulative impact of SCP-5814 has greatly changed the equilibrium pattern of chemical reactions within its region of effect in the Laniakea supercluster, especially reactions involving heavy elements and/or driven by electrostatic interactions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main observable effect of SCP-5814 is to increase the dielectric constant of solvents, which is largely deleterious to most biochemical reactions. An illustrative example of the anomaly's impact is the stability of all-silicon analogs of biochemical molecules in water. Despite the fact that silicon dioxide is more thermodynamically stable than aqueous solutions of silicon biochemical analogues at any time, 8 billion years ago, the precipitation of silicon dioxide from these molecules and water would require a significantly higher activation energy. As a result, they could exist stably in aqueous environments even at room temperature.<br/>\n<br/>\nVia theoretical calculations, we determined that the chemistry of silicon 8 billion years ago may have been as diverse and stable as modern organic chemistry. It was possible to design a whole set of stable silicon-based life-forming molecules. We could compute silicon analogs of amino acids, sugars, and nucleotides. They are capable of aggregating and forming silicon-based life which is similar to modern carbon-based life.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs we know, as one of the most abundant substances in the universe, water would be the most appropriate solvent for life. If we keep pushing back in time, we may discover more varieties of life based on different chemistries. Phosphorus, sulfur, even metals. The tolerance of these systems towards water would be significantly increased, which would greatly increase the possibility of evolving life.<br/>\n<br/>\nBased on such discoveries, we believe that we have already reached a conclusion about the potential hazards of SCP-5814. In the past 8 billion years, the dielectric constant of water has already increased significantly because of SCP-5814. SCP-5814 will lower the tolerance of certain compounds towards water, leading to rapid hydrolytic destruction<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-8\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')\">8</a></sup> of the potential life-forming molecules, and finally reach the inert state of thermodynamic equilibrium.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoomsday, for us, is inevitable, like what silicon-based life went through billions of years ago. We will become the nitrogen, carbon dioxide and water in Earth's atmosphere, become part of this planet's natural environment, and hand the baton of life to the next kind of life form.<br/>\n<br/>\nMechanization or digitization of our bodies may perpetuate the existence of the human species for a short period of time, but these methods still rely on physical mediums, which we expect to be destroyed by water given that the effect of SCP-5814 strengthens as time passes. We now believe that these options will remain vulnerable to SCP-5814 and cannot be regarded as a solution.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe will meet the end of all life even without SCP-5814, but it will accelerate this process. Due to its properties, we currently hold the pessimistic view that we cannot contain the effects of SCP-5814, just as how we cannot resist the second law of thermodynamics.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Addendum III.</strong> Archaeological Exploration History in Greenland</p>\n<p>In year 1986, giant groups of supracrustal rock pillars were discovered beneath the tundra in Greenland while quarrying.

Some contents of the exploration activities are summarized in the extract of the related report shown below.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u2026\u2026These ancient rock pillars are quite unusual. They were very well preserved by the surface tundra, which allowed us to investigate structural details even after billions of years.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have discovered complicated, intercrossing caves within these pillars, unexplainable by any known natural causes. These special cave-like structures may have specific functions in the past, such as an ancient city built by prehistoric civilizations.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fourth operation has brought back a 2.4\u00a0mL sample of an unidentified amber-colored liquid and a cuboid sample of diamond containing regular etched patterns with stored information. The liquid was later identified to be polysiloxane compounds dissolved with low amounts of silicon-oxygen clusters, likely to be the remains of organisms based on silicon-oxygen chemistry.<br/>\n<br/>\nConsidering that the pillars were formed 3.8 billion years ago, it is unlikely that the structures were built by terrestrial carbon-based organisms. This point of time is earlier than the earliest carbon-based life. We can confirm that we have discovered direct evidence of form of life based on silicon-oxygen compounds, which is different from almost all known carbon-based organisms. This area may be ruins of a colony of these silicon-oxygen-based organisms.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-right\" style=\"width:300px;\"><img alt=\"Si\" class=\"image\" src=\"http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5814/Si\" style=\"width:300px;\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width:300px;\">\n<p>A specimen of silicon-oxygen-based organisms discovered in the operation.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Direct evidence of life based on silicon-oxygen compounds was discovered in nearby sedimentary rock layers during the sixth exploration operation.

To cultivate these organisms, a solvent called dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) should be used to replace water. The relative dielectric constant of DMSO is 48, significantly lower than the value of water (around 80). The need for DMSO for this organism could be explained by the effect of SCP-5814, which has raised the dielectric constant of water.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum IV.</strong> Extract from PMRI's report on the latest progress about the clay hypothesis<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-9\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-9')\">9</a></sup>\uff08\u2588/\u2588/2019\uff09</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some hypotheses postulate that clay minerals have played essential roles in the formation of carbon-based life on Earth.

Several pieces of evidence have supported the hypothesis that porous structures inside clay minerals may absorb carbon-containing molecules that can create life e.g. amino acids, allowing them to react in the clay hydrogel, resulting in important biomacromolecules.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-11\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-11')\">11</a></sup><br/>\n<br/>\nRecent results from internal research have also shown that the formation of carbon-based lifeforms is likely to be based within vesicles of clay minerals containing transition metal elements. The formation of such vesicles in a silicon-rich environment is not difficult. They raise carbon-based life, like alchemists' flasks raised homunculi.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-12\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-12')\">12</a></sup><br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, from alternative perspective, another possibility emerges. As fungi live on the nutrition in dead wood, could carbon-based organisms be born on the corpses of silicon-based life?<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently, the team studying SCP-5814 has reported some notable discoveries. They analyzed ore samples collected in Greenland since 1991 and unexpectedly discovered some polysiloxane liquids within, which contain a high content of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, phosphorus, and silicon-oxygen clusters with unusually complex structures. In inorganic synthesis chemistry, such compounds are considered precursors to the synthesis of silicate minerals.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have never discovered such compounds in nature previously, as according to current experimental results, such compounds should be unstable under the conditions for hydrothermal mineralization. But if we consider SCP-5814's effects, then we must conclude that such molecules belonged to the corpses of a lifeform based on a silicon-oxygen biology.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe silicates in the region have existed for about 3.7 billion years. The formation of silicates generally indicates the collapse of complex systems based on silicon-oxygen clusters; in other words, the domination of silicon-based lifeforms on Earth, if it ever happened, would have ended about 3.7 billion years ago. Modern biology hypothesizes that this is the time period when carbon-based lifeforms originated on the Earth.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaking Freking's law into consideration, we determined that when the Earth was just formed, carbon-containing compounds were too inert to evolve life. But approximately 3.7 billion years ago, SCP-5814 made the chemistry of carbon close to the edge of being able to evolve life. Under those conditions, the formation of life would require assistance from some catalysts, such as the aforementioned clay.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Addendum V.</strong> Interpretation of information contained within recovered diamond</p>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-right\" style=\"width:300px;\"><img alt=\"kaleidoscope\" class=\"image\" src=\"http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5814/kaleidoscope\" style=\"width:300px;\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width:300px;\">\n<p>Microscopic observation of the internal pattern of the diamond sample.

SCP-5814's phenomenon is unlikely to cause any significant threats to carbon-based organisms for the foreseeable future, but it is expected that a mass extinction of carbon-based life will occur on a timescale of millions of years.\n\n\n\nThe anomalous effect of SCP-5814 is observable with the following procedure.\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\" + Technical details\" hide=\"- Hide technical details\"]]\n\n\n\nWith a period of 72 hours, the speed of light in standard 0.020 mol/L potassium hydrogen phthalate solution is to be measured under 298.15K and 101.325kPa.[[footnote]]Common room temperature (25.00 \u00b0C; 77.00 \u00b0F) and atmospheric pressure.[[/footnote]] The solution's obtained dielectric constant is then used for confirming Freking's Law (see below) by substituting the measured value into the equation. This result should be directly reported to the Overseer Council if a nonnegligible deviation from Freking's Law is found in more than 10 consecutive measurements.\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-5814 is an anomalous phenomenon influencing multiple clusters within the Laniakea supercluster[[footnote]]The supercluster where the Milky Way is located.[[/footnote]].\n\n\n\nSCP-5814 does not change physical laws in the affected region but affects the behavior of chemical reactions by altering the interaction strength between atoms and molecules, sharply decreasing the activation energy[[footnote]]The energy needed to initiate a chemical reaction. The energy of the reaction system will first increase to a maximum value (the \"energy barrier\") and then drop back to form the products with lower energy. The process is analogous to a climbing a mountain to reach a plain. The energy required to overcome the barrier is called activation energy.[[/footnote]] of different reactions involving electric charge, making systems that are thermodynamically unstable but dynamically stable reach the status of thermal equilibrium rapidly. Considering that non-equilibrium processes play essential roles in the sustaining of life, progression of SCP-5814 over time may cause a CC-Class \"Collapse of Chemistry\" scenario, with the result that carbon-based chemistry will no longer provide conditions suitable for life.\n\n\n\nAlthough the potential destructive effects of SCP-5814 has never been directly observed, studies have revealed that SCP-5814 may have initiated several CC-Class Scenarios in the past, resulting in the current ecology of the universe. Based on observations, SCP-5814 currently has limited negative impacts on carbon-based biology, but its effect will be unignorable in the time scale\u00a0\u00a0of millions of years.\n\n\n\nThe effects of SCP-5814 within its range of influence are embodied by a specific medium, SCP-5814-A. SCP-5814-A behaves like an ideal gas physically and is speculated to be composed of a kind of previously unknown boson[[footnote]]A class of particles. The main features of these particles is that they have integer spin, and an infinite number of bosons can occupy the same quantum state.[[/footnote]]. Particles that constitute SCP-5814-A are electrically neutral, but has a measurable electric susceptibility and behaves as a dielectric material in the presence of an electric field, manifesting an induced dipole [[footnote]]Electric susceptibility is the strength of a material's electric polarization when an external electric field is applied. The dielectric constant is a physical quantity reflecting the strength of this response.[[/footnote]]. SCP-5814-A can spatially penetrate all known solids, liquids, and gases, but its effects only manifest at atomic scales. For interactions at subatomic scales, SCP-5814-A will not cause any obvious effects.\n\n\n\nSCP-5814-A's electric susceptibility anomalously increases over time. As SCP-5814-A can penetrate through all known forms of matter, changes in its electric susceptibility affect the polarity of nearby matter, increasing the macroscopic dielectric constant of causing polar materials. It is proven that the rate of change in electric susceptibility follows the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 equation. Based on theoretical computation, the current value of SCP-5814-A's electric susceptibility is \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n\n**Addendum I.** The discovery of SCP-5814\n\n\n\nIn 1972, Foundation researcher Dr. Arnold Freking discovered a change in the measured speed of light in the air while reviewing earlier measurements of the speed of light. Though insignificant, the measured speed of light in air was found to have decreased in the past 100 years. This effect was shown to be more observable in water, in which the speed of light has decreased by \u2588\u2588.\u2588\u2588% in the last 100 years. Observations of other physical constants, such as measurements of the rate of nuclear reactions, have shown that speed of light in vacuum has not changed. Analysis based on observations, Hubble's law[[footnote]]A law used to determine the velocity of galaxies.[[/footnote]], and virial theorem[[footnote]]A physical law describing the relation between potential energy and kinetic energy of a system. The existence of unobservable substances (such as dark matter) was postulated based on unusual values obtained by Hubble's law and virial theorem.[[/footnote]] has shown that an unknown medium is distributed across certain regions of the Laniakea Supercluster. This medium had a certain degree of electric susceptibility and increased the dielectric constant of polar substances such as water upon interaction.\n\n\n\nAnalysis based on observed values showed that under the effects of SCP-5814-A, the speed of light observed in different media over time follows the equation c=c,,0,,\u00d7(b,,F,,+k,,F,,t)^^-1/2^^, now called Freking's law. This result implies that SCP-5814-A causes the relative dielectric constant of matter to change linearly with time. Dr. Freking deemed such phenomenon enough to declare SCP-5814 an anomaly. He reported his observation result to the Physics and Mathematics Research Institution of the Foundation (SCP-PMRI), who then classified the phenomenon on \u2588\u2588/\u2588/1980.\n\n\n\n**Addendum II.** Extract SCP-5814 research report, submitted to the Overseer Council by PMRI (\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2000)\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> name=http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5814/EA|align=center|caption=Under the effect of SCP-5814, the activation energy of some reactions will be significantly lowered, which allows the corresponding reactions to proceed at a relatively low temperature.]]\n\n\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0\u2026\u2026By applying computational methods, we have proven that the cumulative impact of SCP-5814 has greatly changed the equilibrium pattern of chemical reactions within its region of effect in the Laniakea supercluster, especially reactions involving heavy elements and/or driven by electrostatic interactions.\n\n> @@@@\n\n> The main observable effect of SCP-5814 is to increase the dielectric constant of solvents, which is largely deleterious to most biochemical reactions. An illustrative example of the anomaly's impact is the stability of all-silicon analogs of biochemical molecules in water. Despite the fact that silicon dioxide is more thermodynamically stable than aqueous solutions of silicon biochemical analogues at any time, 8 billion years ago, the precipitation of silicon dioxide from these molecules and water would require a significantly higher activation energy. As a result, they could exist stably in aqueous environments even at room temperature.\n\n> @@@@\n\n> Via theoretical calculations, we determined that the chemistry of silicon 8 billion years ago may have been as diverse and stable as modern organic chemistry. It was possible to design a whole set of stable silicon-based life-forming molecules. We could compute silicon analogs of amino acids, sugars, and nucleotides. They are capable of aggregating and forming silicon-based life which is similar to modern carbon-based life.\n\n> @@@@\n\n> As we know,\u00a0\u00a0as one of the most abundant substances in the universe, water would be the most appropriate solvent for life. If we keep pushing back in time, we may discover more varieties of life based on different chemistries. Phosphorus, sulfur, even metals. The tolerance of these systems towards water would be significantly increased, which would greatly increase the possibility of evolving life.\n\n> @@@@\n\n> Based on such discoveries, we believe that we have already reached a conclusion about the potential hazards of SCP-5814. In the past 8 billion years, the dielectric constant of water has already increased significantly because of SCP-5814. SCP-5814 will lower the tolerance of certain compounds towards water, leading to rapid hydrolytic destruction[[footnote]]Collapse of molecular structure due to reacting with water.[[/footnote]] of the potential life-forming molecules, and finally reach the inert state of thermodynamic equilibrium.\n\n> @@@@\n\n> Doomsday, for us, is inevitable, like what silicon-based life went through billions of years ago. We will become the nitrogen, carbon dioxide and water in Earth's atmosphere, become part of this planet's natural environment, and hand the baton of life to the next kind of life form.\n\n> @@@@\n\n> Mechanization or digitization of our bodies may perpetuate the existence of the human species for a short period of time, but these methods still rely on physical mediums, which we expect to be destroyed by water given that the effect of SCP-5814 strengthens as time passes. We now believe that these options will remain vulnerable to SCP-5814 and cannot be regarded as a solution.\n\n> @@@@\n\n> We will meet the end of all life even without SCP-5814, but it will accelerate this process. Due to its properties, we currently hold the pessimistic view that we cannot contain the effects of SCP-5814, just as how we cannot resist the second law of thermodynamics.\n\n\n\n**Addendum III.**\u00a0\u00a0Archaeological Exploration History in Greenland\n\n\n\nIn year 1986, giant groups of supracrustal rock pillars were discovered beneath the tundra in Greenland while quarrying. These rock pillars may be among the oldest landscapes on the Earth, estimated to have existed for over 3.8 billion years, but internally displaying excavation marks unexplainable by natural phenomena.\n\n\n\nSite-\u2588\u2588 acquired ownership of the land on \u2588/\u2588/1986 and cordoned off surrounding regions. Exhumations completed on \u2588/\u2588/1990.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> name=http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5814/800px-Uummannaq-mountain-southeastern-pillar-trabants.jpg|align=center|caption=Part of rock pillars in Greenland Region after completion of exhumation.]]\n\n\n\nDuring 1991~2013, MTF-\u2588-\u2588\u2588 carried out multiple explorations of the area and revealed more clues about the previous effects of SCP-5814 on Earth. Some contents of the exploration activities are summarized in the extract of the related report shown below.\n\n\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0\u2026\u2026These ancient rock pillars are quite unusual. They were very well preserved by the surface tundra, which allowed us to investigate structural details even after billions of years.\n\n> @@@@\n\n> We have discovered complicated, intercrossing caves within these pillars, unexplainable by any known natural causes. These special cave-like structures may have specific functions in the past, such as an ancient city built by prehistoric civilizations.\n\n> @@@@\n\n> The fourth operation has brought back a 2.4 mL sample of an unidentified amber-colored liquid and a cuboid sample of diamond containing regular etched patterns with stored information. The liquid was later identified to be polysiloxane compounds dissolved with low amounts of silicon-oxygen clusters, likely to be the remains of organisms based on silicon-oxygen chemistry.\n\n> @@@@\n\n> Considering that the pillars were formed 3.8 billion years ago, it is unlikely that the structures were built by terrestrial carbon-based organisms. This point of time is earlier than the earliest carbon-based life. We can confirm that we have discovered direct evidence of form of life based on silicon-oxygen compounds, which is different from almost all known carbon-based organisms. This area may be ruins of a colony of these silicon-oxygen-based organisms.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> name=http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5814/Si|caption=A specimen of silicon-oxygen-based organisms discovered in the operation.]]\n\n\n\nDirect evidence of life based on silicon-oxygen compounds was discovered in nearby sedimentary rock layers during the sixth exploration operation. Fossil-like fragments of a previously unknown organism were found, along with the existence of silicate particles encapsulating some catalytically-active cluster molecules, mainly composed of silicon and oxygen.\n\n\n\nThese particles were confirmed to be spore-like propagules of a silicon-based lifeform, which survives on silicate minerals. To cultivate these organisms, a solvent called dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) should be used to replace water. The relative dielectric constant of DMSO is 48, significantly lower than the value of water (around 80). The need for DMSO for this organism could be explained by the effect of SCP-5814, which has raised the dielectric constant of water.\n\n\n\n**Addendum IV.**\u00a0\u00a0Extract from PMRI's report on the latest progress about the clay hypothesis[[footnote]]A hypothesis about the origin of life. This theory proposes that the primitive form of cells is small bubbles in aluminosilicate clay minerals containing biomacromolecules. The clay minerals are capable of catalyzing the formation of these macromolecules and protecting them against hydrolytic decomposition.[[/footnote]]\uff08\u2588/\u2588/2019\uff09\n\n\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0Some hypotheses postulate that clay minerals have played essential roles in the formation of carbon-based life on Earth. There is already literature documenting that clay minerals can store energy from mechanical force and cosmic rays, and may enable the formation of primordial organic molecules with such energy.[[footnote]]Reference: Coyne, L. M., Lawless, J., Lahav, N., Sutton, S., & Sweeney, M. (1981). Clays as prebiotic photocatalysts. In Origin of life (pp. 115-124). Springer, Dordrecht.[[/footnote]]. There have been recent multiple publications focusing on this hypothesis. Several pieces of evidence have supported the hypothesis that porous structures inside clay minerals may absorb carbon-containing molecules that can create life e.g. amino acids, allowing them to react in the clay hydrogel, resulting in important biomacromolecules.[[footnote]]Reference: Yang, D., Peng, S., Hartman, M. R., Gupton-Campolongo, T., Rice, E. J., Chang, A. K., ... & Luo, D. (2013). Enhanced transcription and translation in clay hydrogel and implications for early life evolution. Scientific reports, 3, 3165.[[/footnote]]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> Recent results from internal research have also shown that the formation of carbon-based lifeforms is likely to be based within vesicles of clay minerals containing transition metal elements. The formation of such vesicles in a silicon-rich environment is not difficult. They raise carbon-based life, like alchemists' flasks raised homunculi.[[footnote]]Artificial human-like creatures in alchemical legends.[[/footnote]]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> However, from alternative perspective, another possibility emerges. As fungi live on the nutrition in dead wood, could carbon-based organisms be born on the corpses of silicon-based life?\n\n> @@@@\n\n> Recently, the team studying SCP-5814 has reported some notable discoveries. They analyzed ore samples collected in Greenland since 1991 and unexpectedly discovered some polysiloxane liquids within, which contain a high content of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, phosphorus, and silicon-oxygen clusters with unusually complex structures. In inorganic synthesis chemistry, such compounds are considered precursors to the synthesis of silicate minerals.\n\n> @@@@\n\n> We have never discovered such compounds in nature previously, as according to current experimental results, such compounds should be unstable under the conditions for hydrothermal mineralization. But if we consider SCP-5814's effects, then we must conclude that such molecules belonged to the corpses of a lifeform based on a silicon-oxygen biology.\n\n> @@@@\n\n> The silicates in the region have existed for about 3.7 billion years. The formation of silicates generally indicates the collapse of complex systems based on silicon-oxygen clusters; in other words, the domination of silicon-based lifeforms on Earth, if it ever happened, would have ended about 3.7 billion years ago. Modern biology hypothesizes that this is the time period when carbon-based lifeforms originated on the Earth.\n\n> @@@@\n\n> Taking Freking's law into consideration, we determined that when the Earth was just formed, carbon-containing compounds were too inert to evolve life. But approximately 3.7 billion years ago, SCP-5814 made the chemistry of carbon close to the edge of being able to evolve life. Under those conditions, the formation of life would require assistance from some catalysts, such as the aforementioned clay.\n\n\n\n**Addendum V.**\u00a0\u00a0Interpretation of information contained within recovered diamond\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> name=http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5814/kaleidoscope|caption=Microscopic observation of the internal pattern of the diamond sample. Colors observed in the photo were caused by interference of light between etched patterns.]]\n\n\n\nDuring the 4^^th^^ operation exploring the area in Greenland, a finely polished black moissanite[[footnote]]A type of hard mineral composed primarily of silicon carbide.[[/footnote]] sphere was discovered. Using center of gravity, it was determined that one side of the moissanite sphere was hollow and the other was solid. After breaking the sphere's hollow side, a cuboid sample of colorless diamond with dimensions 1.2 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 0.8 cm was recovered, with etched traces inside. The etching method for such patterns is currently unknown.\n\n\n\nOn \u2588/\u2588\u2588/2020, decryption work on information stored within diamond crystal was finished. The stored content was a quintuply mathematically encrypted radio wave signal, with a frequency of \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588GHz. Excluding environment noise, a complicated periodic signal was be identified, speculated to be an analytic language; vocabulary was only partially translated. The wave record lasted for 17 minutes and 24 seconds.\n\n\n\n> **(white noise)**\n\n> @@@@\n\n>[(expressing negative emotion)]-[individual]-[death]-[(unidentifiable, speculated to be a noun)]-[information]-[conserve]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> [prehistoric]-[life]-[Laniakea Supercluster?]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> [5]-[13]-[14]-[15]-[16]-[23,8]-[26,27,28,44,76]-[42,74,8][[footnote]]Spectulated to be atomic numbers of elements that constitutes backbones of the corresponding forms of life.[[/footnote]]-[\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588]-[life]-[civilization? culture? technology?]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> [live? survive?]-[competition]-[planet? galaxy?]-[water]-[dependence]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> **(white noise)**\n\n> @@@@\n\n> [(possibly expressing relation between subjects)]-[war? conflict? anger?]-[extinction? collapse?]-[14]-[(expressing active voice)]-[SCP-5814-A?]-[weapon]-[release? generate?]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> [water]-[deadly]-[hydrolysis?]-[oxidation]-[life]-[destroy? kill? stop?]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> [release? generate?]-[control]-[(expressing negation)]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> [extinction? collapse?]-[(expressing order)]-[\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588]-[13]-[5]-[26,27,28,44,76]-[23,8]-[16]-[15]-[42,74,8]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> [aimless spatial movement?]-[(expressing negative emotion)]-[14][[footnote]]14 is the atomic number of silicon.[[/footnote]]-[throughout]-[Laniakea Supercluster?]-[numerous]-[planet? galaxy?]-[(expressing negative emotion)]-[SCP-5814-A?]-[avoid happening of a certain incident?]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> **(white noise)**\n\n> @@@@\n\n> [planet? galaxy?]-[other]-[14]-[machanilization?]-[body]-[oxidation]-[(expressing causality)]-[extinction? collapse?]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> [planet? galaxy?]-[other]-[14]-[hydrolysis?]-[(expressing causality)]-[extinction? collapse?]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> [corpse? remains?]-[14]-[hydrolysis?]-[(expressing causality)]-[body]-[formation]-[life]-[14,8][[footnote]]8 is the atomic number of oxygen.[[/footnote]]-[(first person plural?)]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> [evolving]-[life]-[14,8]-[civilization? culture? technology?]-[time scale expression]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> [**Earth's coordinates**]-[(expressing a certain moment?)]-[14]-[arrive? reach?]-[SCP-5814-A?]-[arrive? reach?]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> [(expressing a certain moment?)]-[extinction? collapse?]-[14]-[inevitable]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> [hydrolysis?]-[corpse? remains?]-[14]-[mantle?]-[formation]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> **(white noise)**\n\n> @@@@\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0[(expressing a certain moment?)]-[extinction? collapse?]-[14,8]-[start]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> [aimless spatial movement?]-[(expressing negative emotion)]-[14,8]-[throughout]-[Laniakea Supercluster?]-[numerous]-[planet? galaxy?]-[(expressing negative emotion)]-[SCP-5814-A?]-[avoid happening of a certain incident?]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> [**Earth's coordinates**]-[(expressing a certain moment?)]-[14,8]-[arrive? reach?]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> [(expressing a certain moment?)]-[(unidentifiable, speculated to be a noun)]-[hydrolysis?]-[death]-[individual]-[all]-[inevitable]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> [future form expression?]-[extinction? collapse?]-[14,8]-[inevitable]-[corpse? remains?]-[14]-[earth crust?]-[formation]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> [(expressing negative emotion)]-[information]-[record]\n\n> @@@@\n\n> **(white noise)**\n\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n<< [[[SCP-5813]]] | SCP-5814 | [[[SCP-5815]]] >>\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>\n\n|author=Re_spectators]]\n\n=====\n\n[[<]]\n\n> **Filename:** Laniakea.jpg\n\n> **Name:**Laniakea.jpg\n\n> **Author:** Andrew Z.

If SCP-621-KO-1 moves from its original location, the moved instance of SCP-621-KO-1 must be found as soon as possible. After discovery, proceed with the same procedure as stated above.</p>\n<p>Should before the Foundation discovers the instances, civilians who first come in contact with SCP-621-KO-1, and there is a potential or already occurring SCP-621-KO-2, then Mobile Task Force Lambda-92 (\"Shutter Chance\") Members are dispatched to capture or remove all instances of SCP-621-KO-2 that arise, and for the phenomena caused by the instances, civilians who witnessed them are to be administered with Class-A Amnestics.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-621-KO is divided into SCP-621-KO-1 and SCP-621-KO-2. SCP-621-KO-1 is a structure in the form of a street lamp or sign that can appear around the world. Its appearance is the same as an ordinary sign or street lamp, but there is a poster on the body saying \"Give me food and I will run an errand!\". SCP-621-KO-1's anomalous properties will occur several hours after placing edible organic matter around the object and writing the errand on a blank piece of paper affixed to the object, excluding requests that \"requires a substantial amount or can only be done by anomalous means\". The organic matter and white paper are lost, and the person who made a certain request to the object<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>to fulfill the request in some way. The more organic matter issued, the faster and more accurately a given request appears to be fulfilled. SCP-621-KO-1 moves periodically, and its purpose or reason is unknown.</p>\n<p>SCP-621-KO-2 refers to all anomalous insects related to SCP-621-KO-1, primarily composed of several species of moths (Heterocera). If a subject places edible organic matter on SCP-621-KO-1 and writes errands on a piece of paper attached to SCP-621-KO-1, several hours later, the instances return to SCP-621-KO-1-1. Instances of SCP-621-KO-2 only perform actions that appear to be part of a request made by the subject and disappear immediately upon completion of the task. While SCP-621-KO-2 individuals appear to be able to die from external factors during these errands, it is almost impossible to witness SCP-621-KO-2, which died as soon as it senses a threat. Other than that, no accurate facts are known about SCP-621-KO-2 yet.</p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">+\u00a0Access\u00a0fileserve.ko:E:/621ko/files/test.log</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">-\u00a0Close</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<div style=\"display: block ; border : solid 1px #444444 ; background :#F5F5F5 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h2 id=\"toc0\"><span>SCP-621-KO Experiment logs</span></h2>\n</div>\n<p>Records of experiments using instances of SCP-621-KO to determine its exact properties. <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">The permission of one Level 3 or higher person is required for the experiment.</span> Testing on SCP-621-KO is no longer possible for the reasons described below.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Experiment log 621-KO-RS1</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Researcher:</strong> Dr. Seoan Min<br/>\n<strong>Purpose:</strong> Testing to determine SCP-621-KO's response to expensive errands.<br/>\n<strong>Products:</strong> Food waste, 10\u00a0kg<br/>\n<strong>Contents:</strong> \u201cGive me 10 million Korean Won.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Result:</strong> After several hours, the paper and food wastes attached to SCP-621-KO-1 were successfully dissipated, but SCP-621-KO-2 did not appear.

If SCP-621-KO-1 moves from its original location, the moved instance of SCP-621-KO-1 must be found as soon as possible. After discovery, proceed with the same procedure as stated above. \n\n\n\nShould before the Foundation discovers the instances, civilians who first come in contact with SCP-621-KO-1, and there is a potential or already occurring SCP-621-KO-2, then Mobile Task Force Lambda-92 (\"Shutter Chance\") Members are dispatched to capture or remove all instances of SCP-621-KO-2 that arise, and for the phenomena caused by the instances, civilians who witnessed them are to be administered with Class-A Amnestics.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-621-KO is divided into SCP-621-KO-1 and SCP-621-KO-2. SCP-621-KO-1 is a structure in the form of a street lamp or sign that can appear around the world.\u00a0\u00a0Its appearance is the same as an ordinary sign or street lamp, but there is a poster on the body saying \"Give me food and I will run an errand!\". SCP-621-KO-1's anomalous properties will occur several hours after placing edible organic matter around the object and writing the errand on a blank piece of paper affixed to the object, excluding requests that \"requires a substantial amount or can only be done by anomalous means\". The organic matter and white paper are lost, and the person who made a certain request to the object[[footnote]]Hereafter SCP-621-KO-1-1[[/footnote]]to fulfill the request in some way. The more organic matter issued, the faster and more accurately a given request appears to be fulfilled. SCP-621-KO-1 moves periodically, and its purpose or reason is unknown. \n\n\n\nSCP-621-KO-2 refers to all anomalous insects related to SCP-621-KO-1, primarily composed of several species of moths (Heterocera). If a subject places edible organic matter on SCP-621-KO-1 and writes errands on a piece of paper attached to SCP-621-KO-1, several hours later, the instances return to SCP-621-KO-1-1. Instances of SCP-621-KO-2 only perform actions that appear to be part of a request made by the subject and disappear immediately upon completion of the task. While SCP-621-KO-2 individuals appear to be able to die from external factors during these errands, it is almost impossible to witness SCP-621-KO-2, which died as soon as it senses a threat. Other than that, no accurate facts are known about SCP-621-KO-2 yet.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Access fileserve.ko:E:/621ko/files/test.log\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"display: block ; border : solid 1px #444444 ; background :#F5F5F5 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n++ SCP-621-KO Experiment logs\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nRecords of experiments using instances of SCP-621-KO to determine its exact properties. --The permission of one Level 3 or higher person is required for the experiment.-- Testing on SCP-621-KO is no longer possible for the reasons described below.\n\n\u00a0\n\n-----\n\n\n\n**Experiment log 621-KO-RS1**\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Researcher:** Dr. Seoan Min\n\n**Purpose:** Testing to determine SCP-621-KO's response to expensive errands.\n\n**Products:** Food waste, 10 kg\n\n**Contents:** \u201cGive me 10 million Korean Won.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Result:** After several hours, the paper and food wastes attached to SCP-621-KO-1 were successfully dissipated, but SCP-621-KO-2 did not appear. Later, when a 100 won coin owned by Dr. Min Seo-an was completely destroyed or lost, or when the coin was used, it took on an anomalous property of being regenerated through some kind of anomalous action. Its exact working principle is unknown. Currently, the coin has been completely neutralized after a total of 100,000 regenerations.\n\n\u00a0\n\n----\n\n\n\n**Experiment log 621-KO-RS3**\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Researcher:** Researcher Lee Seon-Kyung \n\n**Purpose:** Experiments to find out the response of SCP-621-KO to wishes that are impossible.\n\n**Products:** Dead piglet carcass\n\n**Contents:** \"Please let me fly.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Results:** Several hours later, the paper attached to SCP-621-KO-1 and the body were successfully destroyed, and one instance of SCP-621-KO-2 appeared and disappeared after leaving a plane ticket at Researcher Seon-Kyung Lee's home.

Literally.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Dr. Clara:** And what?\n\n\u00a0\n\n**SCP-621-KO-2:** We decided to live there.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Dr. Clara:** Are we talking about insects like you?\n\n\u00a0\n\n**SCP-621-KO-2:** That's right, insects. No, weird insects. All are intelligent, some have more unusual abilities.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Dr. Clara:** Keep telling me.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**SCP-621-KO-2:** Anyway, we were living in peace and being self-sufficient there. But one day, the violets suddenly began to turn to waste. The place is decaying, the water is no longer flowing, the air is stifling...\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Dr. Clara:** Do you know why?\n\n\u00a0\n\n**SCP-621-KO-2:** I do not know.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Dr. Clara:** Hmm, I see. Then why are you doing this?\n\n\u00a0\n\n**SCP-621-KO-2:** To revive my hometown, violets were once more crowded with life than they are now. All kinds of anomalous bugs are coming in from the outside.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Dr. Clara:** I see.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**SCP-621-KO-2:** Oh. Did I mention this? When the violet was ruined. Not all of them agreed to save the violet.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Dr. Clara:** Who is that?\n\n\u00a0\n\n**SCP-621-KO-2:** Other bugs, especially flies, roaches, cicadas, mosquitoes... Well, you know those guys you hate when you hear their names?\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Dr. Clara:** Please tell me more.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**SCP-621-KO-2:** In the early days of the devastation of the violets, everyone was in favor of saving them, but when there was no sign of improvement, they ran away. And it was argued \"We have to supply food and resources from outside.

I mean, you guys, the houses of humans. They invade your place of residence, eat yours, and take yours away.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Dr. Clara:** Oh.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**SCP-621-KO-2:** In the process, we disagreed with them. First of all, the risk is too high. Even if you're quick like them. Most bugs die when they meet humans. Death.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Dr. Clara:** So what happened?\n\n\u00a0\n\n**SCP-621-KO-2:** Seeking coexistence with humans. We do it this way.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Dr. Clara:** I see. \n\n\n\n**SCP-621-KO-2:** Well, we always pursued coexistence with humans, but humans don't always like us. //(silence)// I think it's because of the bugs that left the violet.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Clara:** Why?\n\n\u00a0\n\n**SCP-621-KO-2:** Well, think about it. Violet deserters, like mosquitoes, flies, and cockroaches.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Dr. Clara:** Ah.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**SCP-621-KO-2:** Furthermore, out of the anomalous ones. Either they spread the plague by colluding with the Plague Gods... or become a huge danger in themselves. Are there a lot of bugs these days? Do you know? Like that.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Dr. Clara:** All right. At this point, the interview seems to be sufficient. SCP-529-KO, thanks for your cooperation.

The storage space above (8-E) is currently being cleared of its contents and is considered to be part of SCP-6260's containment area. Other objects may be kept in the aforementioned area with Research Curator approval, with the exclusion of any data storage devices, including magnetic, digital, physical, biological (cellular material, brain tissue and other objects containing information encoded on a molecular level). This restriction does not apply during experimentation. Storage space 9-E has been retooled into a cinema hall for the purpose of testing.</p>\n<p>No personnel are allowed within a 4.5 metre radius of SCP-6260, with operation involving the object taking place with mechanical equipment free of electronic computation devices (such as hydraulic manipulators). All personnel are allowed to examine the motion-picture, provided they maintain notes or video recordings of everything on screen past the 218 second mark.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6260 is a metallic film reel case with 16-mm celluloid and optical soundtrack inside. The object bears a sticker note reading \"Experiment recordings. Site 44. #153. 1974. For internal use. Safe for display\" in English. This information is redoubled in Russian on the opposite side of the case, along with all the inventory data. The tape is 1800 metres long. Manual frame-by-frame analysis of SCP-6260 without use of a projector has determined that the projected image corresponds to that on the reel up to frame 5241 (218 seconds in), but what follows after is random footage, unique to every showing of SCP-6260. All attempts to reproduce the film or extract separate frames have failed.</p>\n<p>The main anomalous effect of the object (referred to as SCP-6260-A) is that prolonged storage of any form of data - audio, video, static imagery, text, or biological information - in proximity of the object causes degradation of said data. The effect presents itself in the form of soundtrack corruption, disappearance of objects or whole frames from video footage (digital or film-recorded), deformation of images on paper (up until complete unrecognizability), disappearance or distortion of text. This influence results in irreversible retrograde amnesia and dysfunction of biological processes on human beings due to mutation of DNA and RNA. Prolonged human presence within 4.5 metres of SCP-6260 results in the following consequences (averaged and dependent on distance from SCP-6260 and degree of continuity):</p>\n<p>1) Long-term memory failure during the first 2 hours of contact, progressing and irreversible retrograde amnesia during the first 5 hours of contact, irreversible loss of higher skills and aptitudes after 12 hours of contact, complete degradation of base cognitive processes after 50-60 hours of contact;</p>\n<p>2) Extremely weak DNA mutations (replication failure) during the first 10 hours of contact. Considerable destructive biological processes in test subjects' organisms, coupled with acute apoptosis of actively proliferating cells from 10 to 55 hours of contact. Breaking contact at this stage consequently causes formation and development of malignant neoplasms. Catastrophic degenerative changes on cellular and generic levels will occur, with DNA sequence destruction, total cell death of hepatobiliary and blood-vasculary systems, as well as cell apoptosis of the central neural system following after. Subjects will expire after 70 to 80 hours from time of contact.</p>\n<p>SCP-6260-A appears to be highly related to the effect known as SCP-6260-B, which is the appearance of some data lost to the effect of the anomaly in SCP-6260 as played within a film projector, suggesting a kind of \"absorption\" of said data by the object. Past 218 seconds in, the movie contains fragments of information destroyed as a result of the object's influence. Examination of various versions of the movie has yielded several distinct characteristics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All versions of the movie are monochrome;</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The presence of a background audio scale unique to each viewing of the movie and conveying feelings described as \"oppressive\", \"tedious\", \"cacophonic\". Many viewers noted a distinct pervasiveness of the sounds, reporting being unable to mentally distance themselves from them.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The presence of \"men in white coats\", SCP-6260-N (not including the persons within the fragment up to 218 seconds in) as central actors in the movie's storyline. These persons will move around the scene without using normal limb movement. Their legs will always be pressed together, and no visible use of muscles has been observed. Their arms remain static while the person moves (pressed close to the body or held in the position they assumed before initiating movement). The subjects move in short, barely observable shifts, \"vibrating\" slightly, which cannot be written off as artefacts of otherwise smooth and stable playback. Likewise, the subjects do not use their necks to turn their heads, instead turning the whole body in place as needed, without vibration or shifts. No blinking or movement of pupils has been observed. In a number of cases, SCP-6260-N's uniform bears heraldry of the Foundation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SCP-6260 was located within the archives of Site 7. The Foundation's practitioners were assigned to the film libraries for the purpose of viewing archived movies for planned inventory inspection and acquisition of knowledge. On 31.08.2018, archivist E. Povishev proceeded with the showing of films from the \"International archives\" section, containing declassified materials transferred around 1990s by foreign colleagues during formation of the Russian branch of the SCP Foundation. During the viewing, racks of seemingly light-struck film have been found; SCP-6260 was located among them.</p>\n<p>The relations between \"SCP objects\" demonstrated in the movie and the real ones [REDACTED]. However, a number of portions of the movie contains noticeable references to the existing objects numbered \u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, as well as objects, documentation of which was held in the damaged section of the Site 7 archives (see report 6260-18-9-AA for full list). Full analysis of archived data loss is currently in progress.</p>\n<p>The relations between storylines demonstrated in the movie and memories lost by employees under the effect of the object are currently being ascertained.</p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">+\u00a0Transcript\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0main\u00a0fragment\u00a0of\u00a0SCP-6260</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">-\u00a0Close</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>Seconds</th>\n<th>Synopsis</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1-4</td>\n<td>Frames denoting the film as belonging to the Central Foundation Archive in the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 cave complex, viewing safety mark.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4-6</td>\n<td>Film cut.

The image of the man on the wall changes to a comical schematic caricature of a bright vibrating skeleton on dark background. Sets of symbols and punctuation marks appear in the air, similar to depictions of foul language in cartoon media.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>432-518</td>\n<td>Film cut. A city park, two children walk along the alley. The monochrome colour scheme prevents attempts to ascertain the time of day. Silhouettes of three swaying men moving with legs closed appear in the distance; one of them is holding balloons. The children run away in panic, the camera follows them. A woman-like figure appears in front of them. The children run to it, but notice that it also does not move its legs, though it doesn't sway like the \"men in coats\" either. The woman moves monotonously, as if sliding, statue-like. The camera turns around and films the SCP-6260-N instances in close proximity. [This fragment bears some resemblance to Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 childhood memories, which he cited during employment discussions as his first personal contact with the anomalous (that being the woman-like figure).

A SCP-6260-N instance shows a sign reading \"SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588. 05/18/1974\", then leaves. The camera shows another SCP-6260-N instance standing beside a human lying down (identified as D-63574, deceased after 72 hours of contact with SCP-6260). After five seconds of stillness SCP-6260-N's mouth begins to sharply open and close unnaturally. The process can be described as part of the lower jaw detaching between chin and lower lip, with two vertical black stitches forming along the edges of the deformed area. The process continues with various levels of intensity for about a minute, before the instance begins to perform manipulations with unknown equipment. The instance begins to attempt to apply an IV with an extremely long needle to the man, who resists and screams inaudibly.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>734 - 1218</td>\n<td>Film cut. The scene corresponds to block 4 of Site 7, where a number of experiments on the SCP-6260 took place. A SCP-6260-N instance sits at the table across a 16-year old child. Both subjects proceed to play chess, with the instance appearing to lack even basic rule knowledge of the game. In response to the opponent's valid moves it throws two figures off the board, ingests one and partially inserts another into his nostril. After breaking the chess clock with repeated presses of the button, the instance puts the chess away and places two pens and a piece of paper on the table. The subjects proceed to play tic-tac-toe. The coated person places both a nought and a cross during one match, often misses the cells or even draws on the table itself. In their last match the instance loses their pen and attempts to draw a cross using its finger. Despairing, SCP-6260-N instance rips the paper apart, eats it, then begins monotonously beating the teen on the head with a fist, bending only the elbow.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1219 - 1249</td>\n<td>No film cut. A short fragment of film depicts a person in an exposure suit running through a dark tunnel. After several seconds a large group of pursuers appears out of the dark from off-screen, consisting of SCP-6260-N instances with the faces of different people, among which have been found: Leslie Nielsen, Benny Hill, Louis de Fun\u00e8s, Bill Murray, archivist Povishev, D-63574, Dr. Heffelbaum (curator of SCP-6260) and several of the research team staff. All these instances wear white coats. Leslie Nielsen waves a screw driving machine above his head menacingly, Benny Hill runs with a large potted ficus in his hands, archivist Povishev pushes a cart of film reels with Bill Murray sitting in it. The scene is accompanied by the default oppressive audio sequence with an overlaid laugh track.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1250 - 1401</td>\n<td>Film cut. Extremely low video quality. The oppressive audio background has been replaced with a pleasant musical composition. Scene unknown. A teenager sits at the table takes turns using a screwdriver and soldering tools. A large toy robot resides nearby. After a short period of work the teenager unscrews the robot's head, installs a part inside, drips in a portion of liquid from his oil can, then screws the head back on. The robot's eyes light up one after the other, the mouth opens and closes a few times. The child stands up from his seat, the robot follows with its legs closed, waddling from side to side. Sudden change of scene. Home environment. Both of the subjects mentioned above sit on the floor of a living room corresponding to the style of the USA's seventies. The robot is playing with a toy rocket, the boy is drawing the portrait of a girl, displaying a high level of artistic skill. After some time the child and the robot sit on the sofa and turn on an old-looking television, which proceeds to play cartoons. The child laughs, with the robot often widely opening and closing its mouth. The TV screen suddenly displays a splash picture with the logo of the Foundation on white with undiscernable writing, the usual oppressive audio background returns. The child begins to cry, the robot proceeds to assiduously destroy the TV.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>s.s.s.

The subject hysterically asks to stop the experiment (likely addressing what is happening on the screen). The image deformation scene causes genuine fright to the subject. Suddenly, the fragment is cut short. A scene with a boy holding an encyclopedia appears on screen, the subject calms down and approaches close to the screen. The subject begins to talk with the movie projection, the boy on the screen mutely opens his mouth in response. (The following is a transcript of the recording procured by a lip reader after the Incident.) S.s.s.

The storage space above (8-E) is currently being cleared of its contents and is considered to be part of SCP-6260's containment area. Other objects may be kept in the aforementioned area with Research Curator approval, with the exclusion of any data storage devices, including magnetic, digital, physical, biological (cellular material, brain tissue and other objects containing information encoded on a molecular level). This restriction does not apply during experimentation. Storage space 9-E has been retooled into a cinema hall for the purpose of testing.\n\n\n\nNo personnel are allowed within a 4.5 metre radius of SCP-6260, with operation involving the object taking place with mechanical equipment free of electronic computation devices (such as hydraulic manipulators). All\u00a0\u00a0personnel are allowed to examine the motion-picture, provided they maintain notes or video recordings of everything on screen past the 218 second mark.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-6260 is a metallic film reel case with 16-mm celluloid and optical soundtrack inside. The object bears a sticker note reading \"Experiment recordings. Site 44. #153. 1974. For internal use. Safe for display\" in English. This information is redoubled in Russian on the opposite side of the case, along with all the inventory data. The tape is 1800 metres long. Manual frame-by-frame analysis of SCP-6260 without use of a projector has determined that the projected image corresponds to that on the reel up to frame 5241 (218 seconds in), but what follows after is random footage, unique to every showing of SCP-6260. All attempts to reproduce the film or extract separate frames have failed.\n\n\n\nThe main anomalous effect of the object (referred to as SCP-6260-A) is that prolonged storage of any form of data - audio, video, static imagery, text, or biological information - in proximity of the object causes degradation of said data. The effect presents itself in the form of soundtrack corruption, disappearance of objects or whole frames from video footage (digital or film-recorded), deformation of images on paper (up until complete unrecognizability), disappearance or distortion of text. This influence results in irreversible retrograde amnesia and dysfunction of biological processes on human beings due to mutation of DNA and RNA. Prolonged human presence within 4.5 metres of SCP-6260 results in the following consequences (averaged and dependent on distance from SCP-6260 and degree of continuity):\n\n\n\n1) Long-term memory failure during the first 2 hours of contact, progressing and irreversible retrograde amnesia during the first 5 hours of contact, irreversible loss of higher skills and aptitudes after 12 hours of contact, complete degradation of base cognitive processes after 50-60 hours of contact;\n\n\n\n2) Extremely weak DNA mutations (replication failure) during the first 10 hours of contact. Considerable destructive biological processes in test subjects' organisms, coupled with acute apoptosis of actively proliferating cells from 10 to 55 hours of contact. Breaking contact at this stage consequently causes formation and development of malignant neoplasms. Catastrophic degenerative changes on cellular and generic levels will occur, with DNA sequence destruction, total cell death of hepatobiliary and blood-vasculary systems, as well as cell apoptosis of the central neural system following after. Subjects will expire after 70 to 80 hours from time of contact.\n\n\n\nSCP-6260-A appears to be highly related to the effect known as SCP-6260-B, which is the appearance of some data lost to the effect of the anomaly in SCP-6260 as played within a film projector, suggesting a kind of \"absorption\" of said data by the object. Past 218 seconds in, the movie contains fragments of information destroyed as a result of the object's influence. Examination of various versions of the movie has yielded several distinct characteristics:\n\n\n\n* All versions of the movie are monochrome;\n\n\n\n* The presence of a background audio scale unique to each viewing of the movie and conveying feelings described as \"oppressive\", \"tedious\", \"cacophonic\". Many viewers noted a distinct pervasiveness of the sounds, reporting being unable to mentally distance themselves from them.\n\n\n\n* The presence of \"men in white coats\", SCP-6260-N (not including the persons within the fragment up to 218 seconds in) as central actors in the movie's storyline. These persons will move around the scene without using normal limb movement. Their legs will always be pressed together, and no visible use of muscles has been observed. Their arms remain static while the person moves (pressed close to the body or held in the position they assumed before initiating movement). The subjects move in short, barely observable shifts, \"vibrating\" slightly, which cannot be written off as artefacts of otherwise smooth and stable playback. Likewise, the subjects do not use their necks to turn their heads, instead turning the whole body in place as needed, without vibration or shifts. No blinking or movement of pupils has been observed. In a number of cases, SCP-6260-N's uniform bears heraldry of the Foundation.\n\n\n\nSCP-6260 was located within the archives of Site 7. The Foundation's practitioners were assigned to the film libraries for the purpose of viewing archived movies for planned inventory inspection and acquisition of knowledge. On 31.08.2018, archivist E. Povishev proceeded with the showing of films from the \"International archives\" section, containing declassified materials transferred around 1990s by foreign colleagues during formation of the Russian branch of the SCP Foundation. During the viewing, racks of seemingly light-struck film have been found; SCP-6260 was located among them.\n\n\n\nThe relations between \"SCP objects\" demonstrated in the movie and the real ones [REDACTED]. However, a number of portions of the movie contains noticeable references to the existing objects numbered \u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, as well as objects, documentation of which was held in the damaged section of the Site 7 archives (see report 6260-18-9-AA for full list). Full analysis of archived data loss is currently in progress.\n\n\n\nThe relations between storylines demonstrated in the movie and memories lost by employees under the effect of the object are currently being ascertained.\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Transcript of the main fragment of SCP-6260\" hide=\"- Close\" hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n\n\n\n||~ Seconds ||~ Synopsis ||\n\n|| 1-4 || Frames denoting the film as belonging to the Central Foundation Archive in the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 cave complex, viewing safety mark.

A large group of men in coats with a defunct logo of the Foundation on their chevrons inspects flasks and test tubes filled with various liquids and powders. Some of the glassware bears labels \"H2O\", \"Cocoa\", \"Very dangerous acid\".||\n\n|| 347-378 || Sudden change in frame. The same SCP-6260-N instances stand in two rows in the same lab space, holding each other by the shoulders and performing a sort of \"sirtaki\" dance. The rows fluently shift side to side in opposite directions from each other. Their legs are closed, forming a visual sensation of \"unseen levitation\". ||\n\n|| 379-384 || Film cut.

A plaque reading \"SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\" hangs above his head. A man in a coat stands nearby and semi-periodically throws and raises a switch in unnatural motions using only the bend of his elbow. The image of the man on the wall changes to a comical schematic caricature of a bright vibrating skeleton on dark background. Sets of symbols and punctuation marks appear in the air, similar to depictions of foul language in cartoon media. ||\n\n|| 432-518 || Film cut. A city park, two children walk along the alley. The monochrome colour scheme prevents attempts to ascertain the time of day. Silhouettes of three swaying men moving with legs closed appear in the distance; one of them is holding balloons. The children run away in panic, the camera follows them. A woman-like figure appears in front of them. The children run to it, but notice that it also does not move its legs, though it doesn't sway like the \"men in coats\" either. The woman moves monotonously, as if sliding, statue-like. The camera turns around and films the SCP-6260-N instances in close proximity. [This fragment bears some resemblance to Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 childhood memories, which he cited during employment discussions as his first personal contact with the anomalous (that being the woman-like figure).

A SCP-6260-N instance shows a sign reading \"SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588. 05/18/1974\", then leaves. The camera shows another SCP-6260-N instance standing beside a human lying down (identified as D-63574, deceased after 72 hours of contact with SCP-6260). After five seconds of stillness SCP-6260-N's mouth begins to sharply open and close unnaturally. The process can be described as part of the lower jaw detaching between chin and lower lip, with two vertical black stitches forming along the edges of the deformed area. The process continues with various levels of intensity for about a minute, before the instance begins to perform manipulations with unknown equipment. The instance begins to attempt to apply an IV with an extremely long needle to the man, who resists and screams inaudibly. ||\n\n|| 734 - 1218\u00a0\u00a0|| Film cut. The scene corresponds to block 4 of Site 7, where a number of experiments on the SCP-6260 took place. A SCP-6260-N instance sits at the table across a 16-year old child. Both subjects proceed to play chess, with the instance appearing to lack even basic rule knowledge of the game. In response to the opponent's valid moves it throws two figures off the board, ingests one and partially inserts another into his nostril. After breaking the chess clock with repeated presses of the button, the instance puts the chess away and places two pens and a piece of paper on the table. The subjects proceed to play tic-tac-toe. The coated person places both a nought and a cross during one match, often misses the cells or even draws on the table itself. In their last match the instance loses their pen and attempts to draw a cross using its finger. Despairing, SCP-6260-N instance rips the paper apart, eats it, then begins monotonously beating the teen on the head with a fist, bending only the elbow. ||\n\n|| 1219 - 1249|| No film cut. A short fragment of film depicts a person in an exposure suit running through a dark tunnel. After several seconds a large group of pursuers appears out of the dark from off-screen, consisting of SCP-6260-N instances with the faces of different people, among which have been found: Leslie Nielsen, Benny Hill, Louis de Fun\u00e8s, Bill Murray, archivist Povishev, D-63574, Dr. Heffelbaum (curator of SCP-6260) and several of the research team staff. All these instances wear white coats. Leslie Nielsen waves a screw driving machine above his head menacingly, Benny Hill runs with a large potted ficus in his hands, archivist Povishev pushes a cart of film reels with Bill Murray sitting in it. The scene is accompanied by the default oppressive audio sequence with an overlaid laugh track. ||\n\n|| 1250 - 1401 || Film cut. Extremely low video quality. The oppressive audio background has been replaced with a pleasant musical composition. Scene unknown. A teenager sits at the table takes turns using a screwdriver and soldering tools. A large toy robot resides nearby. After a short period of work the teenager unscrews the robot's head, installs a part inside, drips in a portion of liquid from his oil can, then screws the head back on. The robot's eyes light up one after the other, the mouth opens and closes a few times. The child stands up from his seat, the robot follows with its legs closed, waddling from side to side. Sudden change of scene. Home environment. Both of the subjects mentioned above sit on the floor of a living room corresponding to the style of the USA's seventies. The robot is playing with a toy rocket, the boy is drawing the portrait of a girl, displaying a high level of artistic skill. After some time the child and the robot sit on the sofa and turn on an old-looking television, which proceeds to play cartoons. The child laughs, with the robot often widely opening and closing its mouth. The TV screen suddenly displays a splash picture with the logo of the Foundation on white with undiscernable writing, the usual oppressive audio background returns. The child begins to cry, the robot proceeds to assiduously destroy the TV.||\n\n||\u00a0\u00a0|| s.s.s.

Do you?//\n\n>\n\n> <A rapidly shifting montage containing sped up portions of SCP-6260 appears on the screen. D-22434 complies and runs to the projector. At the same time s.s.s.

Full biological decay happens to the body of the subject within two seconds, excluding only the skeleton on the floor. Ryabov panickedly rushes away from SCP-6260, security personnel armed with batons break into the room.>\n\n>\n\n> <Despite the film reel being ripped out from the projector, the movie continues on for a time.

The facility containing SCP-750-KO is to be affixed with multiple, continuously-running lighting fixtures capable of producing approximately 150 lumens or more. An EFN-111 electromagnetic system is to be placed approximately 10\u00a0m from SCP-750-KO\u2019s containment chamber. In the case of a breach of containment, the EFN-111 system is to be placed in high operation until the breach is contained.\n<p>In the case that SCP-750-KO creates an anomalous event or if members of GOI-1115, \"Anderson Robotics\" are located, personnel are to report to MTF Gamma-13 (\"Asimov's Lawbringers\") or Dr. Lee Sung Bin.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-750-KO is a humanoid figure dressed in a military uniform that commonly associated with the Nazi party in WWII and a steel gas mask that resembles a GP-2 gas mask. SCP-750-KO is equipped with both an exo- and endoskeleton. The endoskeleton of SCP-750-KO is connected to the gasmask, said gasmask is able to power SCP-750-KO's endo- and exoskeleton by converting gas that is typically associated with chemical warfare into electrical energy. The molecular structure of the exoskeleton and endoskeleton has an artificial lattice form, both consisting of a mixture of metals. SCP-750-KO has the following engraved on its head, \u201cW-222,\u201d along with this SCP-750-KO has several other markings present on its form which includes the following: a symbol of \"Schutzstaffel\" on its right wrist, the logo of \"Anderson Robotics\" located on its left wrist, and \"Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd\" on its left ankle.</p>\n<p>Following are other modifications present on SCP-750-KO\u2019s body:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shoulders - Within the shoulders of SCP-750-KO there are pockets of fluid that have the ability to cause a subject to suffer from myocardial infarctions and cause hemorrhages within the brain, resulting in memory loss. Said substance can be administered via SCP-750-KO\u2019s thumb, pinky, or middle finger. When the pockets are depleted then the endoskeleton will begin producing more.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Arms - Inside of the arms of SCP-750-KO, there is a chamber that houses approximately 300\u00a030 caliber bullets. Analysis of said bullets has traced them back to a unique run created by Anderson Robotics. SCP-750-KO is able to use their index and ring finger to fire, bullets typically leave SCP-XXX at speeds approximating 1,300\u00a0m/s. Volumes of bullets that exit SCP-750-KO are typically less than 5 Db. Once the chamber is depleted the exoskeleton will begin the construction of more.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Left side of the head - A button consisting of both silver and copper, when pressed a second exoskeleton will be produced surrounding SCP-750-KO's body. The second layer of SCP-750-KO\u2019s endoskeleton has a molecular structure similar to carbon nanotubes, thus preventing nearly all forms of physical attacks and explosives.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The endoskeleton of SCP-750-KO has a power transfer unit that allows it to turn its electrical output into kinetic energy, due to this it has the ability to run speeds that average out to 50\u00a0m/s. Along with this, an internal device within SCP-750-KO allows itself to be cloaked for up to two weeks, though SCP-750-KO can turn off the ability at will. SCP-750-KO is able to feel both heat and cold, despite lacking the necessary organ and systems.</p>\n<p>SCP-750-KO has a strong adverse reaction to light greater than 93 lumens. When exposed to light above 100 lumens SCP-750-KO will shut down, this is believed to be due to SCP-750-KO\u2019s original purpose of guarding facilities run by Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd's. Later examinations of SCP-750-KO determined that it was damaged during an attempted raid by the Chaos Insurgency sometime during 2003.

Rodbird, who was discoverd at the scene, is also an Anderson Robotics employee, and findings on inquiry were that these two members were confirmed to be the only survivors who were discovered at the scene.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>&lt;Begin log&gt;</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Agent Griggs:</strong> Please take your seat.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Cho Soo Ho:</strong> Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Agent Griggs:</strong> First of all, please state your name for our record.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Cho Soo Ho:</strong> I'm Cho Soo Ho, director of sector B07 in Anderson Robotics.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Agent Griggs:</strong> How are you related to Rodbird?<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Cho Soo Ho:</strong> She is my friend. She is also my coworker.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Agent Griggs:</strong> I see. So let's get down to business, was SCP-750-KO created by Anderson Robotics?<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Cho Soo Ho:</strong> So to summarize, that's not our work. This droid was made in Germany during World War II, was damaged and left to rust in the underground base in Hamburg after the war, and MC&amp;D discovered it by accident.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Agent Griggs:</strong> Did they only make SCP-750-KO? Or did they make others?<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Cho Soo Ho:</strong> They made others.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Agent Griggs:</strong> When did they specifically start to produce it?<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Cho Soo Ho:</strong> Well\u2026 It was 1936 when Hitler commanded Project \"Reversal of Reversal\"Umkehrung der Umkehrung\"\", That's when the droids started to be produced.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Agent Griggs:</strong> Can you tell us more about the project that you mentioned?<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Cho Soo Ho:</strong> Project \"Reversal of Reversal\" is a military robot unit production project that the Nazis has been running since 1936. It was created, on Hitler's instruction, to secure buildings and occupy enemy bases efficiently, to deliver operations rapidly, and to protect key Nazi members.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Agent Griggs:</strong> Was SCP-750-KO also one of the results of the project?<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Cho Soo Ho:</strong> Yes, it was. It joined 8th SS-cavalry division \"Florian Geyer\" and participated in many actions alongside Herman Fegeline. At the same time, many Jewish people and civilians were killed by his hand.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Agent Griggs:</strong> What conflicts did he participate in?<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Cho Soo Ho:</strong> Well\u2026 If I remember correctly, the Babi Yar massacre, Belarus scorched earth policy, and the suppression of the Warsaw uprising.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Agent Griggs:</strong> What did military officers think of SCP-750-KO? Was it positive on the whole?<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Cho Soo Ho:</strong> It was. Wherever he went, the Allies began to retreat or surrender. The #11 was the most capable droid they've ever produced. Even Hitler went from Berlin to Munich in order to meet him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Agent Griggs:</strong> And SCP-750-KO was then found broken at an underground base in Hamburg, Germany after the war. And MC&amp;D discovered it, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Cho Soo Ho:</strong> Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Agent Griggs:</strong> Did SCP-750- KO get broken down during the war?<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Cho Soo Ho:</strong> Nope, I'm afraid not. It is a really strong droid. You can't destroy it in any way. Rather, the Nazis abandoned him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Agent Griggs:</strong> Abandoned? So he was abandoned and left all over the floor?<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Cho Soo Ho:</strong> Yeah. The Nazis neutralized #11 and put him in an underground base in Hamburg.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Agent Griggs:</strong> Why did the Nazis no longer want to utilize SCP-750-KO? Did he cause a \"malfunction\"?<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Cho Soo Ho:</strong> As you said. Well\u2026 about that situation, The 8th SS-cavalry division including #11 was sent to the Eastern Front in 1943 to stop the Soviet Union. Since he completed his massacre missions perfectly and ruthlessly with formidable power, It was a natural step. However, when they got to the front, #11 refused orders. He wouldn't budge despite Fegeline's best efforts, as Fegeline get riled up and drew out a pistol, he suddenly grabbed him with his hands, and then\u2026 threw him away. He got flung headlong nearly 6\u00a0m. According to the report at that time, #11 was emitting smoke from his gas mask and emitting a blue light from his facial recognition device's lamp\u2026 As he was muttering '<em>Murderers(M\u00f6rders)</em>' to his colleagues\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Agent Griggs:</strong> A blue light?<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Cho Soo Ho:</strong> Judging from our production standard, probably an \"Artificial emotional deadlock error\" Indicator lamp was lighted up.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Agent Griggs:</strong> Is it common for an AI to protest like that?<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Cho Soo Ho:</strong> It's not entirely unknown. As you know, the AI is difficult to make and control. Even with technology like that of Anderson Robotics. If you set it too low, it's meaningless. And if you set it too high, you can't control it. Probably Herr Rass, the person in charge of #11, caused this, as he had programmed the AI's intelligence too high\u2026 according to our company's engineers. You know who Herr Rass is, right? The founder who initiated the Fourth Reich after the war.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Agent Griggs:</strong> I think SCP-750-KO was \"malfunctioning\" because \"Herr Rass\" took charge of it. What do you think?<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Cho Soo Ho:</strong> Well, some people have the same thoughts as you. According to the report, #11 acted as if he had a \"real human soul\", not like an \"emotionless and empty tin robot\".<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Agent Griggs:</strong> I understand. Is this a reason why Herr Rass left the third Reich?<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Cho Soo Ho:</strong> No, it isn't. But it was a shock to many people at that time. While the eastern front was being shoved by the Soviet Union, they were betrayed rather than utilizing a high-tech mechanical soldier. Maybe this is the origin of why the royal guards started viewing Rass unfavorably.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Agent Griggs:</strong> Can you tell us what happened to SCP-750-KO since then?<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Cho Soo Ho:</strong> The Nazis have destroyed related documents to prevent embarrassment, but some people already know about it. He helped the Jewish people escape, smashed Reinhard Heydrich's tomb, rescued civilians on the front line\u2026 What's more, I heard there are several cases to Allied records that he passed the Nazis classified information through to the resistance. So he was by himself for about three months, and he was captured and neutralized by the 001-Armoured division.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Agent Griggs:</strong> How did they neutralize SCP-750-KO? Did they use tools like purpose-built weapons, or remote control devices, or what?<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Cho Soo Ho:</strong> They could neutralize it with blueprints for #11 that the Nazi scientists gave them. If it wasn't for blueprints, The 001-Armored division would have gotten their asses kicked by #11.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Agent Griggs:</strong> Do you know anything about that blueprints? For instance, someone or a group who has blueprints right now\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Cho Soo Ho:</strong> Don't know, but I heard that MC&amp;D had ownership, but that all burned out when The Chaos Insurgency attacked them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Agent Griggs:</strong> I understand.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Cho Soo Ho:</strong> Well, that's all I know. Besides, I don't know anything about it in detail.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Agent Griggs:</strong> That's good. Let's call it a day. Agent Alexey, I'd like to ask you to take Mr. Cho Soo Ho outside.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>&lt;End log&gt;</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Closing Statement:</strong> After the interview, Cho Soo Ho said he'd like to join the Foundation. Also, Rodbird who was arrested with him has taken the same stance. This request is currently pending, additionally, an interview will be conducted about Cho Soo Ho and Rodbird.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div></body></html>", "raw_source": "\n\t[[>]]\n\n[[module Rate]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a>\n\n|name=http://scp-int.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-750-ko/portrait-of-an-Air-Raid-Warden-min.jpg\n\n|caption=SCP-750-KO, at the time of initial containment.]]\n\n\n\n**Item #:** SCP-750-KO\n\n\n\n**Object Class:** Keter\n\n\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Revision 02-1\" hide=\"- Hide\"]]SCP-750-KO is to be kept within a modified anomalous objects vault at Site-222K. The door to said containment chamber is to be outfitted with a dual locking system and no less than three LED fixtures are to be installed within the containment chamber, said lights must be pointing to where SCP-750-KO is located within the vault.

The facility containing SCP-750-KO is to be affixed with multiple, continuously-running lighting fixtures capable of producing approximately 150 lumens or more. An EFN-111 electromagnetic system is to be placed approximately 10 m from SCP-750-KO\u2019s containment chamber. In the case of a breach of containment, the EFN-111 system is to be placed in high operation until the breach is contained.\n\n\n\nIn the case that SCP-750-KO creates an anomalous event or if members of GOI-1115, \"Anderson Robotics\" are located, personnel are to report to MTF Gamma-13 (\"Asimov's Lawbringers\") or Dr. Lee Sung Bin.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-750-KO is a humanoid figure dressed in a military uniform that commonly associated with the Nazi party in WWII and a steel gas mask that resembles a GP-2 gas mask. SCP-750-KO is equipped with both an exo- and endoskeleton. The endoskeleton of SCP-750-KO is connected to the gasmask, said gasmask is able to power\u00a0\u00a0SCP-750-KO's endo- and exoskeleton by converting gas that is typically associated with chemical warfare into electrical energy. The molecular structure of the exoskeleton and endoskeleton has an artificial lattice form, both consisting of a mixture of metals. SCP-750-KO has the following engraved on its head, \u201cW-222,\u201d along with this SCP-750-KO has several other markings present on its form which includes the following: a symbol of \"Schutzstaffel\" on its right wrist, the logo of \"Anderson Robotics\" located on its left wrist, and \"Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd\" on its left ankle.\n\n\n\nFollowing are other modifications present on SCP-750-KO\u2019s body:\n\n\n\n* Shoulders - Within the shoulders of SCP-750-KO there are pockets of fluid that have the ability to cause a subject to suffer from myocardial infarctions and cause hemorrhages within the brain, resulting in memory loss. Said substance can be administered via SCP-750-KO\u2019s thumb, pinky, or middle finger. When the pockets are depleted then the endoskeleton will begin producing more.\n\n\n\n* Arms - Inside of the arms of SCP-750-KO, there is a chamber that houses approximately 300 30 caliber bullets. Analysis of said bullets has traced them back to a unique run created by Anderson Robotics. SCP-750-KO is able to use their index and ring finger to fire, bullets typically leave SCP-XXX at speeds approximating 1,300 m/s. Volumes of bullets that exit SCP-750-KO are typically less than 5 Db. Once the chamber is depleted the exoskeleton will begin the construction of more.\n\n\n\n* Left side of the head - A button consisting of both silver and copper, when pressed a second exoskeleton will be produced surrounding SCP-750-KO's body. The second layer of SCP-750-KO\u2019s endoskeleton has a molecular structure similar to carbon nanotubes, thus preventing nearly all forms of physical attacks and explosives.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe endoskeleton of SCP-750-KO has a power transfer unit that allows it to turn its electrical output into kinetic energy, due to this it has the ability to run speeds that average out to 50 m/s. Along with this, an internal device within SCP-750-KO allows itself to be cloaked for up to two weeks, though SCP-750-KO can turn off the ability at will. SCP-750-KO is able to feel both heat and cold, despite lacking the necessary organ and systems.\n\n\n\nSCP-750-KO has a strong adverse reaction to light greater than 93 lumens. When exposed to light above 100 lumens SCP-750-KO will shut down, this is believed to be due to SCP-750-KO\u2019s original purpose of guarding facilities run by Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd's. Later examinations of SCP-750-KO determined that it was damaged during an attempted raid by the Chaos Insurgency sometime during 2003. The high-intensity discharge shut-off system is vulnerable to serious damage through the visual recognition device if the system is exposed to light higher than 100 lumens.\n\n\n\nSCP-750-KO was initially discovered by the foundation following reports of a conflict between two known GoIs in Gwangyang-si and Jeollanam-do in South Korea during 2003. At the time of deployment, The Chaos Insurgency and Anderson Robotics members were engaged in a conflict, and SCP-750-KO was discovered by MTF Gamma-13 (\"Asimov's Lawbringers\") which was deployed to quell the conflict between the two Groups of Interest. Two Anderson Robotics members were arrested at the scene, and four additional documents related to SCP-750-KO were collected.\n\n\n\n__**Document 01#: Addendum 750-KO-A-01**__\n\n\n\nThe following message is from Anderson Robotics to MC&D.\n\nDear Mr. Dallant,\n\n\u00a0\n\n> Your repair request was completed on September 15th.

So let's get down to business, was SCP-750-KO created by Anderson Robotics?\n\n> ****\n\n> **Cho Soo Ho:** So to summarize, that's not our work. This droid was made in Germany during World War II, was damaged and left to rust in the underground base in Hamburg after the war, and MC&D discovered it by accident.\n\n> ****\n\n> **Agent Griggs:** Did they only make SCP-750-KO? Or did they make others?\n\n> ****\n\n> **Cho Soo Ho:** They made others.\n\n> ****\n\n> **Agent Griggs:** When did they specifically start to produce it?\n\n> ****\n\n> **Cho Soo Ho:** Well... It was 1936 when Hitler commanded Project \"Reversal of Reversal\"Umkehrung der Umkehrung\"\", That's when the droids started to be produced.\n\n> ****\n\n> **Agent Griggs:** Can you tell us more about the project that you mentioned?\n\n> ****\n\n> **Cho Soo Ho:** Project \"Reversal of Reversal\" is a military robot unit production project that the Nazis has been running since 1936. It was created, on Hitler's instruction, to secure buildings and occupy enemy bases efficiently, to deliver operations rapidly, and to protect key Nazi members.\n\n> ****\n\n> **Agent Griggs:** Was SCP-750-KO also one of the results of the project?\n\n> ****\n\n> **Cho Soo Ho:** Yes, it was. It joined 8th SS-cavalry division \"Florian Geyer\" and participated in many actions alongside Herman Fegeline. At the same time, many Jewish people and civilians were killed by his hand.\n\n> ****\n\n> **Agent Griggs:** What conflicts did he participate in?\n\n> ****\n\n> **Cho Soo Ho:** Well... If I remember correctly, the Babi Yar massacre, Belarus scorched earth policy, and the suppression of the Warsaw uprising.\n\n> ****\n\n> **Agent Griggs:** What did military officers think of SCP-750-KO? Was it positive on the whole?\n\n> ****\n\n> **Cho Soo Ho:** It was. Wherever he went, the Allies began to retreat or surrender. The #11 was the most capable droid they've ever produced. Even Hitler went from Berlin to Munich in order to meet him.\n\n> ****\n\n> **Agent Griggs:** And SCP-750-KO was then found broken at an underground base in Hamburg, Germany after the war. And MC&D discovered it, right?\n\n> ****\n\n> **Cho Soo Ho:** Yes.\n\n> ****\n\n> **Agent Griggs:** Did SCP-750- KO get broken down during the war?\n\n> ****\n\n> **Cho Soo Ho:** Nope, I'm afraid not. It is a really strong droid. You can't destroy it in any way. Rather, the Nazis abandoned him.\n\n> ****\n\n> **Agent Griggs:** Abandoned? So he was abandoned and left all over the floor?\n\n> ****\n\n> **Cho Soo Ho:** Yeah. The Nazis neutralized #11 and put him in an underground base in Hamburg.\n\n> ****\n\n> **Agent Griggs:** Why did the Nazis no longer want to utilize SCP-750-KO? Did he cause a \"malfunction\"?\n\n> ****\n\n> **Cho Soo Ho:** As you said. Well... about that situation, The 8th SS-cavalry division including #11 was sent to the Eastern Front in 1943 to stop the Soviet Union. Since he completed his massacre missions perfectly and ruthlessly with formidable power, It was a natural step. However, when they got to the front, #11 refused orders. He wouldn't budge despite Fegeline's best efforts, as Fegeline get riled up and drew out a pistol, he suddenly grabbed him with his hands, and then... threw him away. He got flung headlong nearly 6 m. According to the report at that time, #11 was emitting smoke from his gas mask and emitting a blue light from his facial recognition device's lamp... As he was muttering '//Murderers(M\u00f6rders)//' to his colleagues...\n\n> ****\n\n> **Agent Griggs:** A blue light?\n\n> ****\n\n> **Cho Soo Ho:** Judging from our production standard, probably an \"Artificial emotional deadlock error\" Indicator lamp was lighted up.\n\n> ****\n\n> **Agent Griggs:** Is it common for an AI to protest like that?\n\n> ****\n\n> **Cho Soo Ho:** It's not entirely unknown. As you know, the AI is difficult to make and control. Even with technology like that of Anderson Robotics. If you set it too low, it's meaningless. And if you set it too high, you can't control it. Probably Herr Rass, the person in charge of #11, caused this, as he had programmed the AI's intelligence too high... according to our company's engineers. You know who Herr Rass is, right? The founder who initiated the Fourth Reich after the war.\n\n> ****\n\n> **Agent Griggs:** I think SCP-750-KO was \"malfunctioning\" because \"Herr Rass\" took charge of it. What do you think?\n\n> ****\n\n> **Cho Soo Ho:** Well, some people have the same thoughts as you. According to the report, #11 acted as if he had a \"real human soul\", not like an \"emotionless and empty tin robot\".\n\n> ****\n\n> **Agent Griggs:** I understand. Is this a reason why Herr Rass left the third Reich?\n\n> ****\n\n> **Cho Soo Ho:** No, it isn't. But it was a shock to many people at that time. While the eastern front was being shoved by the Soviet Union, they were betrayed rather than utilizing a high-tech mechanical soldier. Maybe this is the origin of why the royal guards started viewing Rass unfavorably.\n\n> ****\n\n> **Agent Griggs:** Can you tell us what happened to SCP-750-KO since then?\n\n> ****\n\n> **Cho Soo Ho:** The Nazis have destroyed related documents to prevent embarrassment, but some people already know about it. He helped the Jewish people escape, smashed Reinhard Heydrich's tomb, rescued civilians on the front line...\u00a0\u00a0What's more, I heard there are several cases to Allied records that he passed the Nazis classified information through to the resistance. So he was by himself for about three months, and he was captured and neutralized by the 001-Armoured division.\n\n> ****\n\n> **Agent Griggs:** How did they neutralize SCP-750-KO? Did they use tools like purpose-built weapons, or remote control devices, or what?\n\n> ****\n\n> **Cho Soo Ho:** They could neutralize it with blueprints for #11 that the Nazi scientists gave them. If it wasn't for blueprints, The 001-Armored division would have gotten their asses kicked by #11.\n\n> ****\n\n> **Agent Griggs:** Do you know anything about that blueprints? For instance, someone or a group who has blueprints right now...\n\n> ****\n\n> **Cho Soo Ho:** Don't know, but I heard that MC&D had ownership, but that all burned out when The Chaos Insurgency attacked them.\n\n> ****\n\n> **Agent Griggs:** I understand.\n\n> ****\n\n> **Cho Soo Ho:** Well, that's all I know. Besides, I don't know anything about it in detail.\n\n> ****\n\n> **Agent Griggs:** That's good. Let's call it a day. Agent Alexey, I'd like to ask you to take Mr. Cho Soo Ho outside.\n\n> ****\n\n> **<End log>**\n\n> ****\n\n> **Closing Statement:** After the interview, Cho Soo Ho said he'd like to join the Foundation. Also, Rodbird who was arrested with him has taken the same stance. This request is currently pending, additionally, an interview will be conducted about Cho Soo Ho and Rodbird.\n", "references": [], "scp": "SCP-750-KO", "scp_number": 750, "series": "international", "tags": ["_cc", "_ko", "anderson", "artifact", "chaos-insurgency", "historical", "humanoid", "international", "keter", "marshall-carter-and-dark", "military", "scp"], "title": "SCP-750-KO", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-750-ko"}, "SCP-824-KO": {"created_at": "2022-05-10T04:18:00", "creator": "Bangja", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Bangja", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/bangja", "comment": "", "date": "2022-05-10T04:18:00"}, {"author": "Bangja", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/bangja", "comment": "Added tags: _ko, computer, euclid, international, liquid, physics, scp, temporal.

Euclid</p>\n<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-824-KO is to be stored in a vacuum container reinforced with shock-absorbent material.

After an in-depth investigation, the source was narrowed down to a facility, to which the Foundation deployed a strike team of four to execute a surprise attack. In response, an unidentified person in the facility quickly stirred SCP-824-KO with a teaspoon. At that moment, the strike team suffered a lag in time, while the person fled as they were used to such situations.
