This reality has been in a continuous cycle since the 'End' of the world. Ordinary people, after their death, wake up from sleep on the day before their death and continue living as if nothing happened. After each cycle, people live the exact life they lived before the cycle, but since they do not remember the life before the cycle, this leads to them dying the same death as before the cycle.</p>\n<p>SCP-001-KO-1 are individuals who, at some point, wake up retaining the memories of the reality they lived in before. This happens randomly. SCP-001-KO-1 can recall events from before the cycle from their current perspective. Soon, SCP-001-KO-1 become aware of how they die, experiencing intense anxiety and fear. If SCP-001-KO-1 prevents the death they are supposed to meet, memories from before the cycle cease to surface. (Refer to Addendum requiem-1)</p>\n<p>Within the Foundation, the objective is to prevent the deaths of each SCP-001-KO-1 progressively, thus preventing the death of all of them. Currently, there are <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">29</span> 30 SCP-001-KO-1, divided into <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">11</span> 12 in the 'safe' group, 10 in the 'progress' group, and 8 in the 'confirmed' group. The 'safe' group consists of individuals who have prevented their most imminent death. This group helps the 'progress' and 'confirmed' groups. The 'progress' group, with help from the 'safe' group, seeks ways to prevent their deaths. The 'confirmed' group consists of unique cases where current methods cannot prevent their inevitable deaths. (Refer to Addendum requiem-2)</p>\n<p>The memories retained by SCP-001-KO-1 are never erased under any circumstances. Therefore, it is recommended that SCP-001-KO-1 periodically receive psychological therapy. (Refer to Addendum requiem-3)</p>\n<p>SCP-001-KO experiences the 'End' just before the cycle restarts. Currently, three known types of the 'End' and other variables leading to different types of the 'End' are being investigated. A variable refers to a situation where a particular action changes future outcomes. To date, 216 variables have been identified. Records of these variables and the results of actions taken based on them remain even after the cycle.</p>\n<p>Currently, only one member of SCP-001-KO-1, O5-\u2588\u2588, has survived until the 'End'. However, no one in the Foundation has yet seen the recently discovered third type of the 'End.' The SCP-001-KO-1 in the 'safe' group is currently trying to find the variables that will allow them to witness this third 'End'.

The counselling and medicine I got at the hospital were of no help. Even now, they keep coming and coming and coming.

For example, the memory of bumping into Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 in the third-floor hallway and spilling coffee on my clothes helped me avoid that exact scenario. If I use this well, it might even help me get a promotion.

I'm considering what I can do to save my colleagues as I assess the situation. First, I need to replace the flask, and I also need to report that the door is broken.

These memories arise from their perspective, amplifying emotions such as fear and anxiety.\n\n\n\nPer the request of O5\u2588\u2588, access to this document is restricted beyond this point for those who are not SCP-001-KO-1. If you are experiencing SCP-001-KO, please proceed according to the special containment procedures outlined above.\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ SCP-001-KO-1 eyes only\" hide=\"- Hide Document\"]]\n\nSCP-001-KO is the reality we live in. This reality has been in a continuous cycle since the 'End' of the world. Ordinary people, after their death, wake up from sleep on the day before their death and continue living as if nothing happened. After each cycle, people live the exact life they lived before the cycle, but since they do not remember the life before the cycle, this leads to them dying the same death as before the cycle.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSCP-001-KO-1 are individuals who, at some point, wake up retaining the memories of the reality they lived in before. This happens randomly. SCP-001-KO-1 can recall events from before the cycle from their current perspective. Soon, SCP-001-KO-1 become aware of how they die, experiencing intense anxiety and fear. If SCP-001-KO-1 prevents the death they are supposed to meet, memories from before the cycle cease to surface. (Refer to Addendum requiem-1)\n\n\n\nWithin the Foundation, the objective is to prevent the deaths of each SCP-001-KO-1 progressively, thus preventing the death of all of them. Currently, there are --29-- 30 SCP-001-KO-1, divided into --11-- 12 in the 'safe' group, 10 in the 'progress' group, and 8 in the 'confirmed' group. The 'safe' group consists of individuals who have prevented their most imminent death. This group helps the 'progress' and 'confirmed' groups. The 'progress' group, with help from the 'safe' group, seeks ways to prevent their deaths. The 'confirmed' group consists of unique cases where current methods cannot prevent their inevitable deaths. (Refer to Addendum requiem-2)\n\n\n\nThe memories retained by SCP-001-KO-1 are never erased under any circumstances. Therefore, it is recommended that SCP-001-KO-1 periodically receive psychological therapy. (Refer to Addendum requiem-3)\n\n\n\nSCP-001-KO experiences the 'End' just before the cycle restarts. Currently, three known types of the 'End' and other variables leading to different types of the 'End' are being investigated. A variable refers to a situation where a particular action changes future outcomes. To date, 216 variables have been identified. Records of these variables and the results of actions taken based on them remain even after the cycle.\n\n\n\nCurrently, only one member of SCP-001-KO-1, O5-\u2588\u2588, has survived until the 'End'. However, no one in the Foundation has yet seen the recently discovered third type of the 'End.' The SCP-001-KO-1 in the 'safe' group is currently trying to find the variables that will allow them to witness this third 'End'. (Refer to Addendum requiem-4)\n\n\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n**Addendum:**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ SCP-001-KO-1 eyes only: requiem-1 \" hide=\"- Secure. Contain.

What exactly is happening to me? Strange things have been happening since a week ago. Is it because of the stress from being overworked? Memories I don't even know of keep appearing. The counselling and medicine I got at the hospital were of no help. Even now, they keep coming and coming and coming. Luckily, when I sleep, I don't think about anything.//\n\n\n\n> Date \u2588\u258825/03/07\n\n> //'Memories' keep surfacing, but I've gotten quite used to them. For example, the memory of bumping into Researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 in the third-floor hallway and spilling coffee on my clothes helped me avoid that exact scenario. If I use this well, it might even help me get a promotion. Still, I can't decide if this is a blessing or a curse.//\n\n\n\n> Date \u2588\u258825/03/09\n\n> //Fuck fuck fuck fuck!! I'm a piece of shit. I knew it and still couldn't do anything. I barely saved my own life. Yeah, this is a curse; someone must be punishing me; what should I do now? I can't ask for help from anyone. No one will understand me. I wish someone would help me, please...//\n\n\n\n> Date \u2588\u258825/03/14\n\n> //I'm coming\u2026 Wait for me//\n\n\n\n> Date \u2588\u258825/03/01\n\n> //I don't know how this happened. Did I go back in time? According to what's written here, I died on March 14th. But I'm writing this on March 1st. And these damn memories are showing up right up to the moments before my death. Damn it.//\n\n\n\n> Date \u2588\u258825/03/08\n\n> //Tomorrow is the day. Could I do it? I'm considering what I can do to save my colleagues as I assess the situation. First, I need to replace the flask, and I also need to report that the door is broken. Also, if that monster freaks out again, I need to call the security team in advance. I'm nervous, but this time, I won't run away. Definitely not.//\n\n\n\n> Date \u2588\u258825/03/10\n\n> //I did it! Although everyone got a bit hurt and in treatment, no one died! I did it! I changed it! I don't know who gave me this curse, but listen up, you bastard, it won't go your way anymore, haha! I will change it!//\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ SCP-001-KO-1 eyes only: requiem-2\" hide=\"- Secure. Contain.

If the world has always been this way and is a natural law, we might need to hold onto this as a last resort.\n\n> \n\n> **J:** (Long pause) It's challenging... having unbearable memories constantly rekindled and seeing someone's death over and over. Seeing someone who will soon die smiling brightly in front of me... and having to bury this overwhelming, maddening sadness without anyone knowing... and also...\n\n> \n\n> **Researcher R:** (Interrupting J.) Alright, I'm going to administer the medication now. If it works, at least you'll be able to spend this cycle more comfortably.

Yes, that's right. It's a piece of music intended to comfort the souls of the departed, a fitting metaphor for our current world. The world ended a long time ago. In a way, the world we exist in now is no more than solace for the world that has vanished.\n\n> \n\n> We tried. To prevent the 'End,' we identified threats, contained them, and conducted experiments, experiencing an endless cycle of blood and pain. But nothing changed.\n\n> \n\n> Thus, another world vanished. And we moved on to the next requiem, vanishing and moving on repeatedly. The only changes were the discovery of the Foundation, the place that contains dangerous entities, and more of those entities that came to be known as SCPs. There was no progress. It was the opposite. As the cycles repeated, more entities labelled as SCPs were discovered, naturally worsening the situation, and we despaired, treading the same paths dependent on our previous memories.\n\n> \n\n> However, without us realising it, the future had changed at some point. We possessed far greater technology and power and were living beyond the 'End' of the past. We realised that it wasn't that there was no progress; it was just slow. From that moment, we began to perceive this world not as a requiem but as a hymn\u2014a recognition of a new opportunity rather than a lament for a past world.\n\n> \n\n> No one knows how many more times this will repeat. But we do not despair. Now, we focus on changing\u00a0\u00a0the future by rekindling memories of the past to prevent the unfortunate 'End.' To do this, we must secure, contain, and protect.\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n", "references": ["scp-990"], "scp": "SCP-001", "scp_number": 1, "series": "scp-001", "tags": ["001-proposal", "_ko", "international", "keter", "loop", "predictive", "scp"], "title": "SCP-001", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/chamomile82-s-proposal"}}
