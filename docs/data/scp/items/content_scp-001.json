The project aimed to interpret and explain anomalies and integrate them into modern scientific technology. It involved collaboration from approximately 200 research laboratories across 47 universities worldwide.</p>\n<p>The building was constructed in 1950 as a three-story above-ground and two-story below-ground structure. In 1951, it was expanded to include eight underground levels. The above-ground floors primarily housed amenities, accommodation, and facilities for storing entities exhibiting mild anomalies or anomalies that had been explained. The underground levels were utilised as laboratories from the first to the third floor. Additionally, there were containment facilities for typical anomalous entities on the first and second underground floors.</p>\n<p>Each floor was divided into A and B sectors from the fourth underground floor onwards. The B sectors of each floor housed power supply and cooling systems, control rooms, and observation facilities for anomalous entities. The A sectors were equipped with simulators designed to interpret the anomalous nature of the entities. Initially, the simulators only occupied the fourth and fifth underground floors, but as the number of anomalies to be processed increased, they were expanded to include the eighth underground floor in 1952. Each floor's simulator comprised 600 computation devices named AAS-1030, created for the project based on information obtained while interpreting anomalous entities. These devices were divided into six smaller sectors, with 100 installed in each sector. Additionally, depending on the circumstances, all simulators on each floor could be connected simultaneously to interpret more complex anomalies.</p>\n<p>Since its activation in 1951 until its destruction, the simulators interpreted and explained over 300 anomalies. However, the list of interpreted anomalous entities has yet to be recovered.</p>\n<p>On June 20, 1952, while investigating the anomaly of the entity currently designated as SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588, the SCP-001-KO simulator was destroyed. Significant records primarily stored on the third and fourth underground floors were lost along with the simulator. Additionally, 128 researchers and security personnel involved in the project were either killed or reported missing. This incident had a profound impact on the entire project. Firstly, the interpretation of anomalous entities, which relied heavily on the simulator, was disrupted or delayed. Secondly, internal UN pressure regarding the inherent danger posed by anomalous entities forced the project to be halted. Consequently, with no resources left to continue the project, the UN officially abandoned it and closed the facility.</p>\n<p>However, some radical researchers overseeing the project resisted this decision. They argued that interpreting anomalous entities could lead to rapid advancement in science and went on to found the present SCP Foundation. Illegally infiltrating the SCP-001-KO facility, they attempted to restore the simulator while obstructing the sale of SCP-001-KO through lobbying efforts. Moreover, they utilized surviving anomalous entities to perpetuate urban legends about SCP-001-KO, continuously prompting intrusion from outsiders and compelling the UN to incur ongoing expenses. Eventually, in January 1959, the UN negotiated with the Foundation, agreeing that SCP-001-KO would remain officially owned by the UN on the surface. However, the Foundation would be responsible for its management and internal restoration.
