Seems quaint now, huh? Been a long time since we seriously worried about threats coming from home. You're on the young side, right? Were you even here when we were still scared of the Insurgency?</p>\n<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> I wasn't.</p>\n<p><em>Director Johnson chuckles.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Director Johnson:</strong> Honestly, even at the time, First Strike wasn't anything to write home about. Stockpiling anomalous weaponry? Please. We'd mastered <a href=\"/scp-914\">914</a>, and we were already cracking [DATA EXPUNGED] But First Strike was General Bowe's pet project of the month. You know what that meant.</p>\n<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Remind me, if you don't mind?</p>\n<p><strong>Director Johnson:</strong> Access to any SCP you could think of. We started with the old man's favorites, of course. Early numbers only \u2014 an ego thing, you know how these generals were. Cross-testing was the rage at the time \u2014 some of the generals felt we weren't progressing fast enough with individual research projects, and we could learn more faster by knocking anomalies in to each other, like my daughter making her dolls kiss. Maybe leave that one out of the transcript, yeah?</p>\n<p><em>Interviewer makes noncommittal gesture.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Director Johnson:</strong> At the time, we were cross-testing <a href=\"/scp-002\">002</a>, <a href=\"/scp-033\">033</a>, <a href=\"/scp-044\">044</a>, <a href=\"/scp-090\">090</a>, and\u2026 what was the Star Child? <a href=\"/scp-134\">134</a>, I think. Don't figure she ever knew what we were doing with her. If they ever told, I don't know about it. They don't let me have access to those files anymore.</p>\n<p><em>Director Johnson pauses.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Director Johnson:</strong> At any rate, I don't think any of that matters now. That kind of crazy-go-nuts crosstesting doesn't happen anymore \u2014 I think because someone up in Overwatch noticed that the really stable mirror realities typically aren't smashing together literally every anomaly under the sun until their universe implodes in a ball of stupid. How about that, huh? Eh, don't log that either. [REDACTED] will get pissed at me for spreading unpopular opinions.</p>\n<p><em>Interviewer makes noncommittal gesture.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Director Johnson:</strong> The real reason First Strike changed everything is because, thanks to Bowe, we got to test anomalous weapons in neighboring realities. Y'know, the neighboring realities we <em>used</em> to have. You \u2014 you've got your report right there, right? Gamma-Aleph-6 and\u2026 Epsilon-Samekh-4, right?</p>\n<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> That's correct.</p>\n<p><em>Director Johnson nods.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Director Johnson:</strong> Epsilon-Samekh\u2026 that's the one that really went sideways. We were using that one to simulate defenses against extradimensional threats. The ultimate foreign agents, you know? Really lit a fire under generals of a certain kind, if you know what I mean. Bowe got us approval to build a test facility on Epsilon-Samekh, 'specially for extradimensional anomalies. That was the last thing he did for us before he got distracted by a newer, shinier object. I think it was trying to make a clone army out of <a href=\"/scp-076\">076</a> or something embarrassing like that. Maybe it's in your report?</p>\n<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> I'm not cleared to know that, Director.</p>\n<p><strong>Director Johnson:</strong> Right, right. I guess I don't get why they won't let you know that if they let you know about Palisade\u2026 ah well, I'm sure it's not just completely arbitrary like half the expungement in our files or anything. Anyway, two years went by.</p>\n<p><em>Director Johnson takes a deep breath.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Director Johnson:</strong> We didn't get a whole hell of a lot done without Bowe greasing all the gears, but we still had plenty of crosstests to run. We were testing some godawful weapon we got from an SCP crosstest that'd be illegal now outside a mirror reality, and the team monitoring us started reporting some really strange readings.</p>\n<p><em>Director Johnson pauses.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Strange in what way?</p>\n<p><strong>Director Johnson:</strong> Extradimensional contamination, they said. We didn't take it seriously at first. Didn't even stop testing. Then they kept calling us, over the course of the day, more and more panicked. By the end of the week our whole project was on hold. Reality dereification, they were calling it. The whole reality was coming apart under our noses, had been for months, and we'd only just noticed it. Imagine hearing about that \u2014 imagine you'd never heard of something like THE WORM \u2014 sorry, am I supposed to say that in a loud voice, now?</p>\n<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> It's more a mental perception thing. We'll stylize it in all-caps in the log.</p>\n<p><strong>Director Johnson:</strong> Oh, uh. That's very kind of you, I guess. I was saying \u2014 we didn't know realities could fall apart at the time. Not literally. Metaphorically, sure, like we knew about the YK-class Vacuum Decay \u2014 or however they're classifying that now. We had protections against that, even by then. Laws of reality stop working \u2014 we make new laws. Whatever happened, we'd survive, even if humanity didn't. Reality failure \u2014 I think that's ZK-class \u2014 that was purely theoretical. Most of us didn't really believe it could happen. Funny, right?</p>\n<p><em>Director Johnson pauses.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Director Johnson:</strong> Anyway, we shit ourselves. They pulled us out of Epsilon-Samekh, and didn't tell us anything for a month. That whole time, we thought it was our fault. Like we flew too close to the sun, but we weren't the ones who'd fall to the earth. All these crosstests, and we finally found the one that made someone else's reality fall apart.</p>\n<p><em>Director Johnson pauses.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Director Johnson:</strong> Kinda funny, right? Feeling that guilty over the death of one reality\u2026 and these days we go through mirror universes like toilet paper.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-4\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')\">4</a></sup></p>\n<p><em>Director Johnson pauses.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Director Johnson:</strong> Where was I? Right, the end of First Strike. After a month, they figured out what was going on. And we felt better, for a hot minute, until they told us the rest. The real truth was worse. If we'd been right, it would've just been the one reality gone. But the reality was falling apart at the seams because it was being eaten. Being destroyed. Whatever you want to call it. Being dereified by an outside force. The Threat. THE WORM.</p>\n<p><em>Director Johnson pauses.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Director Johnson:</strong> And, yeah.

Then, as previously reported, a similar pattern of events was repeated in Reality Gamma-Aleph-6, followed by 7 other adjacent realities under observation (see addenda).</p>\n<p>Effects are so far inconsistent with known phenomena or SCP objects. However, during the destruction of Reality Gamma-Aleph-6, embedded wave detectors managed to record the advance waves caused by an unknown inbound entity.

Which is to say, you never get one timeline. You get \"clusters\".</p>\n<p>A \"cluster\" of timelines always has either low variance, or high interconnectivity, or rarely, both. What's that mean?</p>\n<p>Low variance means you have many parallel \"mirror universes\". You know, Star Trek style \u2014 does that reference date me? You know, when the heroes jump to another timeline and find themselves, but evil, and wearing goatees. Sometimes there's even less variance than that \u2014 a genetic quirk makes being left-handed more common than right-handed, or Independence Day is a day later than another reality. Sometimes there's no visible variance at all.</p>\n<p>High interconnectivity simply means that the timelines are highly connected, through short-range interdimensional travel. Probably the most common type we've seen are so-called \"Ways\", often accessed through a <a href=\"http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/\">Wanderers' Library</a>).</p>\n<p>As you know, we, the original Foundation, are unique across all timelines, as confirmed by Project Altis.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-15\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-15')\">15</a></sup> But we exist in a cluster, too.

It's just that most of our cluster was destroyed by THE WORM before we created the Palisade.</p>\n<p>Our cluster is high variance \u2014 humanity didn't even exist in most of our former neighbors, and when they did, history was very different. Our cluster makes up for that with high interconnectivity. You can see this with the numerous anomalous gateways we've contained, such as <a href=\"/scp-004\">SCP-004</a>).

There's a lot of anomalous assessment in there that we don't quite understand yet. That said, so far it's been far and away the best way to understand how THE WORM targets timelines.</p>\n<p>What was that? Yes, timelines or realities. Those terms are interchangeable for our purposes, take note. We usually say \"reality\" to describe mainline reality or other non-artificial realities, and \"timeline\" to describe mirror timelines created by the Altis Engine. That's informal, though. I'm gonna stick with realities for now, if that's helpful.</p>\n<p>The reality integrity paradigm is, obviously, a comparison to architectural integrity. Like how earthquakes won't knock down earthquake-proofed buildings.</p>\n<p>Unlike buildings, though, we don't yet know what makes a reality's structural integrity stronger or weaker. For all we know, the paradigm implied by the words \"structural integrity\" may eventually prove inaccurate \u2014 maybe one of you will be the one to give us a better paradigm!</p>\n<p>For now, though, this is the only paradigm backed up by evidence, even if we got that evidence through anomalous means.</p>\n<p>We also don't know what causes a reality to change structural integrity. We only know that it happens.</p>\n<p>Changes to events in a reality's timeline \u2014 such as those produced by a CK-class restructuring event \u2014 may significantly increase or decrease a reality's structural integrity. That's how Palisade usually alters timelines, plus good old-fashioned time travel. Which alters structural integrity too, by the way.</p>\n<p>But you don't actually need anything so drastic. Usually, a reality's structural integrity \u2014 and its vulnerability to THE WORM \u2014 increases or decreases by the simple passage of time.</p>\n<p>And, yes, we've reached the elephant in the room. At the start of Project Palisade, we assessed our reality. And you know what we found. Mainline reality's structural integrity is of\u2026 extremely poor quality. And no one, anywhere, knows why.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-17\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-17')\">17</a></sup></p>\n<p>Our reality integrity has changed since we started Project Palisade. To what, I don't know. That's classified Level 5. O5 only, or whoever else they grant special access to. Doesn't include me \u2014 more's the pity. I only know it's changed, and changed a lot. Why? Your guess is as good as mine.</p>\n<p>But the last thing I can tell you is that in the vast majority of cases Foundation intervention in a timeline results in a decaying reality integrity level. We really have no idea why this is \u2014 especially because Foundation intervention has also sometimes resulted in incredibly strong reality integrity levels. Food for thought. Maybe some of you will figure this one out, too.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-18\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-18')\">18</a></sup></p>\n<p>Oh, good question! So far, several thousand mirror realities created by Project Palisade are considered \"stable\", with a structural integrity sufficient to likely protect them from The Threat, unless mainline Foundation artificially draws it there. That hasn't happened anytime recently, at least \u2014 higher-ups would get really mad. If it's been done before, I don't have access to that information. Yes, it would be an interesting experiment, of course.</p>\n<p>That's correct. We can't simply have humanity migrate to another reality because that would be an act of major interference, which may change that reality's integrity for the worse. For all we know, it could paint a huge target on our backs. Believe me, we thought about that first.</p>\n<p>This is where I should point else something out. All mirror realities created by Project Palisade are officially considered subordinate to mainline reality, whatever their structural integrity. If necessary, we'll make use of them in\u2026 whatever way is appropriate. That's what they were made for. If you'll pardon me getting philosophical here for a moment, it's their ultimate fate. Written in the very fabric of their many universes. Even the strong ones.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-19\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-19')\">19</a></sup></p>\n<p>How many mirror realities have been destroyed?

We represent mainline reality (the original, unaltered timeline). Our humanity must be held paramount over the humanity of any inhabitants of \"mirror\" timelines. The survival of mainline reality shall always be held paramount over the survival of any \"mirror\" timeline, or any other parallel or alternate universe. We are the Foundation, the bedrock on which all of reality rests. For the sake of us all, we cannot fail.\n\nThis statement must be sworn to by all military and civilian leadership of the Foundation.[[footnote]]I swore it too.[[/footnote]]\n\n\n\n##white|.##\n\n\n\n\n\n||**[[size large]]Primary Documentation[[/size]]**||\n\n-----\n\n\n\n**Item #:** SCP-001\n\n\n\n**Object Class:** Thaumiel\n\n\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** [[[good-fences-make-good-neighbors|Absolute secrecy]]] is necessary for the full realization of Project Palisade. Disinformation will focus on exploration of parallel universes for research and protection purposes. Esoteric Containment Systems shall be used as a secondary precaution.\n\n\n\nThe current administration affirms, and mandates, the continuation of Project Palisade regardless of potential cost or consequence.\n\n\n\n**Standard Operating Procedure for Project Palisade:**\n\n\n\n(1) The Altis Engine is used to create a \"cluster\" of mirror timelines, which are defined as artificial timelines constructed by the Prime Foundation solely for Project Palisade.\n\n\n\n(2) Mirror timelines are altered, using controlled CK-class Restructuring events and direct insertion of agents via inter-dimensional travel to desired points in history. \n\n\n\n(3) Mirror timelines are monitored and reality structural integrity analyzed.\n\n\n\n(4) Timelines with a high integrity level are selected for continued study. Timelines with a poor integrity level are designated as shield timelines.\n\n\n\n(5) Proxy agents attract The Threat to a shield timeline, commonly performing anomalous \"rituals\" developed by Esoteric Containment Systems in order to ensure targeting by The Threat.\n\n\n\n> **Note:** As direct travel to shield timelines is necessary for the process, proxy \"[[[uiu-file-2017-003|collaborator]]]\" agents are utilized (occasionally with a small number of mainline Foundation agents as oversight). Proxy agents are all \"[[[scp-3818|mirrors]]]\", typically [[[daffodils|corresponding]]] Foundation personnel taken from mirror timelines. In exchange, their home timelines are protected from The Threat, as long as cooperation lasts.\n\n\n\n(6) Vectors are gathered and distributed to chosen neighboring timelines.\n\n\n\n> **Note:** Vectors are elements from the initial shield timeline, such as a person, animal, or object, which have served as foci of ritual energy. The effect of using vectors is to draw The Threat to many timelines at once, making the attraction process significantly more efficient.\n\n> \n\n> Current standard element is soil from the initial shield timeline (representing \"gravedirt\"), a highly successful [[[TKO|suggestion]]] by a collaborating \"mirror\" instance of the POI \"[[[The Black Queen]]]\".\n\n\n\n(7) All shield timelines are evacuated by any mainline Foundation agents and (when feasible) proxy agents, and monitored until destroyed by The Threat.\n\n\n\nThis process is continually repeated to ensure The Threat is indefinitely kept away from mainline reality.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-001, also known as Project Palisade, is a method of protecting reality from ongoing existential threats. \n\n\n\nPersonnel create mirror timelines, alter them to discover methods of defeating threats, and ultimately divert the largest threats (especially the primary threat referred to as \"The Threat\" and/or \"THE WORM\") to destroy these mirror timelines instead of mainline reality.\n\n\n\nEvery other timeline in which the Foundation exists was created by Project Palisade.[[footnote]] That can't be true. Can it?

The Altis Engine is capable of creating a potentially infinite number of said mirror timelines.\n\n> \n\n> Originally, Project Altis was intended to create \"mirror\" Foundations to aid the Foundation of mainline reality. \"Mirror\" Foundations were to be faced with various challenges that might grant insight to mainline reality, and successful mirror Foundations would then be visited by mainline Foundation agents and an organizational connection established. Ultimately, many mirror Foundations would assist mainline reality in defending against existential threats from the outside. \n\n> \n\n> These aspects of Project Altis were permanently shelved, due to the lack of direct use against THE WORM. The Altis Engine is now almost exclusively used under the banner of Project Palisade.\n\n\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n\n\n[[tab FIRST STRIKE]]\n\n\n\n**\"First Strike\" Project Report:**\n\n\n\n> **Project Codename:** First Strike\n\n> \n\n> **Project#:** PRJFRS-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n> \n\n> **Project Aims:** To successfully create a military-grade anomalous weaponry stockpile for use against foreign agents.\n\n> \n\n> **Project Description:** Project has been permanently suspended.

The project resulted in the discovery of THE WORM.\n\n\n\n**Interview with Director D. B. Johnson[[footnote]]I remember him. He's dead now.[[/footnote]], RE: \"First Strike\"**\n\n\n\n> [BEGIN LOG]\n\n> \n\n> **Director Johnson:** Well, First Strike was just a glorified weapons program. Seems quaint now, huh? Been a long time since we seriously worried about threats coming from home. You're on the young side, right? Were you even here when we were still scared of the Insurgency?\n\n> \n\n> **Interviewer:** I wasn't.\n\n> \n\n> //Director Johnson chuckles.//\n\n> \n\n> **Director Johnson:** Honestly, even at the time, First Strike wasn't anything to write home about. Stockpiling anomalous weaponry? Please. We'd mastered [[[SCP-914|914]]], and we were already cracking [DATA EXPUNGED] But First Strike was General Bowe's pet project of the month. You know what that meant.\n\n> \n\n> **Interviewer:** Remind me, if you don't mind?\n\n> \n\n> **Director Johnson:** Access to any SCP you could think of. We started with the old man's favorites, of course. Early numbers only -- an ego thing, you know how these generals were. Cross-testing was the rage at the time -- some of the generals felt we weren't progressing fast enough with individual research projects, and we could learn more faster by knocking anomalies in to each other, like my daughter making her dolls kiss. Maybe leave that one out of the transcript, yeah? \n\n> \n\n> //Interviewer makes noncommittal gesture.//\n\n> \n\n> **Director Johnson:** At the time, we were cross-testing [[[SCP-002|002]]], [[[SCP-033|033]]], [[[SCP-044|044]]], [[[SCP-090|090]]], and... what was the Star Child? [[[SCP-134|134]]], I think. Don't figure she ever knew what we were doing with her. If they ever told, I don't know about it. They don't let me have access to those files anymore.\n\n> \n\n> //Director Johnson pauses.//\n\n> \n\n> **Director Johnson:** At any rate, I don't think any of that matters now. That kind of crazy-go-nuts crosstesting doesn't happen anymore -- I think because someone up in Overwatch noticed that the really stable mirror realities typically aren't smashing together literally every anomaly under the sun until their universe implodes in a ball of stupid. How about that, huh? Eh, don't log that either. [REDACTED] will get pissed at me for spreading unpopular opinions.\n\n> \n\n> //Interviewer makes noncommittal gesture.//\n\n> \n\n> **Director Johnson:** The real reason First Strike changed everything is because, thanks to Bowe, we got to test anomalous weapons in neighboring realities. Y'know, the neighboring realities we //used// to have. You -- you've got your report right there, right? Gamma-Aleph-6 and... Epsilon-Samekh-4, right?\n\n> \n\n> **Interviewer:** That's correct.\n\n> \n\n> //Director Johnson nods.//\n\n> \n\n> **Director Johnson:** Epsilon-Samekh... that's the one that really went sideways. We were using that one to simulate defenses against extradimensional threats. The ultimate foreign agents, you know? Really lit a fire under generals of a certain kind, if you know what I mean. Bowe got us approval to build a test facility on Epsilon-Samekh, 'specially for extradimensional anomalies. That was the last thing he did for us before he got distracted by a newer, shinier object. I think it was trying to make a clone army out of [[[SCP-076|076]]] or something embarrassing like that. Maybe it's in your report?\n\n> \n\n> **Interviewer:** I'm not cleared to know that, Director.\n\n> \n\n> **Director Johnson:** Right, right. I guess I don't get why they won't let you know that if they let you know about Palisade... ah well, I'm sure it's not just completely arbitrary like half the expungement in our files or anything. Anyway, two years went by. \n\n> \n\n> //Director Johnson takes a deep breath.//\n\n> \n\n> **Director Johnson:** We didn't get a whole hell of a lot done without Bowe greasing all the gears, but we still had plenty of crosstests to run. We were testing some godawful weapon we got from an SCP crosstest that'd be illegal now outside a mirror reality, and the team monitoring us started reporting some really strange readings.\n\n> \n\n> //Director Johnson pauses.//\n\n> \n\n> **Interviewer:** Strange in what way?\n\n> \n\n> **Director Johnson:** Extradimensional contamination, they said. We didn't take it seriously at first. Didn't even stop testing. Then they kept calling us, over the course of the day, more and more panicked. By the end of the week our whole project was on hold. Reality dereification, they were calling it. The whole reality was coming apart under our noses, had been for months, and we'd only just noticed it. Imagine hearing about that -- imagine you'd never heard of something like THE WORM -- sorry, am I supposed to say that in a loud voice, now?\n\n> \n\n> **Interviewer:** It's more a mental perception thing. We'll stylize it in all-caps in the log.\n\n> \n\n> **Director Johnson:** Oh, uh. That's very kind of you, I guess. I was saying -- we didn't know realities could fall apart at the time. Not literally. Metaphorically, sure, like we knew about the YK-class Vacuum Decay -- or however they're classifying that now. We had protections against that, even by then. Laws of reality stop working -- we make new laws. Whatever happened, we'd survive, even if humanity didn't. Reality failure -- I think that's ZK-class -- that was purely theoretical. Most of us didn't really believe it could happen. Funny, right?\n\n> \n\n> //Director Johnson pauses.//\n\n> \n\n> **Director Johnson:** Anyway, we shit ourselves. They pulled us out of Epsilon-Samekh, and didn't tell us anything for a month. That whole time, we thought it was our fault. Like we flew too close to the sun, but we weren't the ones who'd fall to the earth. All these crosstests, and we finally found the one that made someone else's reality fall apart.\n\n> \n\n> //Director Johnson pauses.//\n\n> \n\n> **Director Johnson:** Kinda funny, right? Feeling that guilty over the death of one reality... and these days we go through mirror universes like toilet paper.[[footnote]]Now you can see why.[[/footnote]]\n\n> \n\n> //Director Johnson pauses.//\n\n> \n\n> **Director Johnson:** Where was I? Right, the end of First Strike. After a month, they figured out what was going on. And we felt better, for a hot minute, until they told us the rest. The real truth was worse. If we'd been right, it would've just been the one reality gone. But the reality was falling apart at the seams because it was being eaten. Being destroyed. Whatever you want to call it. Being dereified by an outside force. The Threat. THE WORM.\n\n> \n\n> //Director Johnson pauses.//\n\n> \n\n> **Director Johnson:** And, yeah.

In specific cases, civilizations are allowed to create anomalies similar to Project Altis, but capabilities are always altered to protect mainline reality (even if this alteration is not known to the mirror civilization).\n\n* Inhabitants of the mirror timeline are never able to access mainline reality. \n\n> **Note:** This protection has occasionally failed.

Unfortunately, personnel were not properly briefed on handling such a circumstance, and delivered ill-advised explicit threats. SCP-1985 instance reacted negatively, and retreated from mainline reality through self-termination before apprehension could occur. Mechanism of accessing mainline reality unclear, but appears to have been accidental.

(Initial test runs limited number of SCP items, but the limit has gradually been raised as more stable mirror timelines have been successfully created.)\n\n* Typical SCP-classified items are usually horrifying in nature (reflecting mainline reality), though many exceptions usually exist (and may often technically outnumber the SCP items perceived as horrifying in nature).\n\n* World-ending threats are usually present, but usually in forms which the Foundation is theoretically able to at least temporarily contain (or survive without containing for a significant observation period).\n\n* SCP database entries usually work like mainline reality, except that gaps are present. Gaps correspond to SCP items not present in that timeline. Local mirror Foundation agents always explain the missing items in a way that makes sense to themselves (typically that the slot is waiting to be filled, or theoretically exists but has all access denied).

Which is to say, you never get one timeline. You get \"clusters\".\n\n> \n\n> A \"cluster\" of timelines always has either low variance, or high interconnectivity, or rarely, both. What's that mean? \n\n> \n\n> Low variance means you have many parallel \"mirror universes\". You know, Star Trek style -- does that reference date me? You know, when the heroes jump to another timeline and find themselves, but evil, and wearing goatees. Sometimes there's even less variance than that -- a genetic quirk makes being left-handed more common than right-handed, or Independence Day is a day later than another reality. Sometimes there's no visible variance at all.\n\n> \n\n> High interconnectivity simply means that the timelines are highly connected, through short-range interdimensional travel. Probably the most common type we've seen are so-called \"Ways\", often accessed through a [http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/ Wanderers' Library]). \n\n> \n\n> As you know, we, the original Foundation, are unique across all timelines, as confirmed by Project Altis.[[footnote]]How can you possibly confirm something like this?[[/footnote]] But we exist in a cluster, too. We used to visit neighboring realities quite often, in fact -- we being the Foundation, of course. No, you didn't miss a CK-class event.

Our cluster makes up for that with high interconnectivity. You can see this with the numerous anomalous gateways we've contained, such as [[[SCP-004]]]). Maybe someday we'll point THE WORM there too, eh? No great loss. Another little joke.[[footnote]]Ghoulish.

There's a lot of anomalous assessment in there that we don't quite understand yet. That said, so far it's been far and away the best way to understand how THE WORM targets timelines. \n\n> \n\n> What was that? Yes, timelines or realities. Those terms are interchangeable for our purposes, take note. We usually say \"reality\" to describe mainline reality or other non-artificial realities, and \"timeline\" to describe mirror timelines created by the Altis Engine. That's informal, though. I'm gonna stick with realities for now, if that's helpful.\n\n> \n\n> The reality integrity paradigm is, obviously, a comparison to architectural integrity. Like how earthquakes won't knock down earthquake-proofed buildings.\n\n> \n\n> Unlike buildings, though, we don't yet know what makes a reality's structural integrity stronger or weaker. For all we know, the paradigm implied by the words \"structural integrity\" may eventually prove inaccurate -- maybe one of you will be the one to give us a better paradigm!\n\n> \n\n> For now, though, this is the only paradigm backed up by evidence, even if we got that evidence through anomalous means.\n\n> \n\n> We also don't know what causes a reality to change structural integrity. We only know that it happens.\n\n> \n\n> Changes to events in a reality's timeline -- such as those produced by a CK-class restructuring event -- may significantly increase or decrease a reality's structural integrity. That's how Palisade usually alters timelines, plus good old-fashioned time travel. Which alters structural integrity too, by the way. \n\n> \n\n> But you don't actually need anything so drastic. Usually, a reality's structural integrity -- and its vulnerability to THE WORM --\u00a0\u00a0increases or decreases by the simple passage of time.\n\n> \n\n> And, yes, we've reached the elephant in the room. At the start of Project Palisade, we assessed our reality. And you know what we found. Mainline reality's structural integrity is of... extremely poor quality. And no one, anywhere, knows why.[[footnote]]What if our reality integrity being so low means we were created... and created badly? How do we know we're the first iteration? How do we even know that some version of us wasn't destroyed already?[[/footnote]]\n\n> \n\n> Our reality integrity has changed since we started Project Palisade. To what, I don't know. That's classified Level 5. O5 only, or whoever else they grant special access to. Doesn't include me -- more's the pity. I only know it's changed, and changed a lot. Why? Your guess is as good as mine.\n\n> \n\n> But the last thing I can tell you is that in the vast majority of cases Foundation intervention in a timeline results in a decaying reality integrity level. We really have no idea why this is -- especially because Foundation intervention has also sometimes resulted in incredibly strong reality integrity levels. Food for thought. Maybe some of you will figure this one out, too.[[footnote]]When you're half-assing the changes, you fuck a timeline up. When you try harder, the timeline improves. Really not that hard to figure it out. And you still think this isn't what it's about? Still think there's nothing out there, watching? The Worm may have no mind, but something out there does. Some//things//.[[/footnote]]\n\n> \n\n> Oh, good question! So far, several thousand mirror realities created by Project Palisade are considered \"stable\", with a structural integrity sufficient to likely protect them from The Threat, unless mainline Foundation artificially draws it there. That hasn't happened anytime recently, at least -- higher-ups would get really mad. If it's been done before, I don't have access to that information. Yes, it would be an interesting experiment, of course.\n\n> \n\n> That's correct. We can't simply have humanity migrate to another reality because that would be an act of major interference, which may change that reality's integrity for the worse. For all we know, it could paint a huge target on our backs. Believe me, we thought about that first.\n\n> \n\n> This is where I should point else something out. All mirror realities created by Project Palisade are officially considered subordinate to mainline reality, whatever their structural integrity. If necessary, we'll make use of them in... whatever way is appropriate. That's what they were made for. If you'll pardon me getting philosophical here for a moment, it's their ultimate fate. Written in the very fabric of their many universes. Even the strong ones.[[footnote]]What if we're wrong? What if they're just... better? What if they deserve to survive, and we don't?[[/footnote]]\n\n> \n\n> How many mirror realities have been destroyed? Hell, I don't know the number.

This was ultimately seen as a positive outcome, given that many mirrors now existed redirect THE WORM to, and that a minority of mirrors were likely not vulnerable to THE WORM, presenting opportunities for long-term study.\n\n\n\nIteration X analysis also reveals that most mirror timelines exhibit hostile environments, and humans (where present) exhibit irrational and violent behavior. Additionally, numerous reality clusters vanished without trace or explanation (perhaps targeted by THE WORM, perhaps not).

Module may be accessed within the Foundation system archive itself, by assigned council only.\n\n\n\nAs of current file update (09/03/2018), Iteration W is the current iteration.\n\n\n\n**07/26/2008:** Any \"key variant\" SCP item with central significance to Project Palisade is now recorded as SCP-001, beginning with item code-named [http://www.scp-wiki.net/jonathan-ball-s-proposal \"Sheaf of Papers\"], along with oldest entry in the pre-SCP classification system, [http://www.scp-wiki.net/dr-gears-s-proposal Item #86243AR-001]. \n\n\n\n**05/01/2009:** As Iteration W stabilizes, O5 Command fully takes on all assignments and guidelines related to Project Palisade. Communications are handled via newly created [http://05command.wikidot.com/ central access hubs].\n\n\n\n**09/04/2009:** All Project Palisade variant creation is temporarily frozen, and experimentation is limited to existing mirror timelines only. Sub-Project code-named \"\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\".\n\n\n\n**12/04/2009:** Project Palisade variant creation resumes.\n\n\n\n**07/27/2011:** With nearly 1000 SCPs in common use as \"variants\" in creation of mirror timelines, it is established that in addition to SCP-001 \"key variants\", new major \"key variants\" shall be chosen and assigned to specific 4-digit system slots (1000, 2000, 3000, etc).\n\n\n\n**02/25/2013:** Mirror timeline creation expanded to focus on [[[canon hub|\"canons\"]]] with no single SCP item as a \"key variant\". \"Canons\" exhibit a high degree of variance for increased testing value.\n\n\n\n**05/27/2014:** Mirror timeline creation further expanded to focus on [[[GOI formats|items held (or assessed) by anomalous Groups of Interest]]] as \"key variants\".\n\n\n\n**04/20/2018:** @@[@@[[[Doomsday Contest|DATA EXPUNGED]]]@@]@@\n\n\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n\n\n[[/tabview]]\n\n\n\n##white|.##\n\n\n\n\n\n||**[[size large]]Project Palisade Alternatives[[/size]]**||\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n[DATA EXPUNGED BY ORDER OF O5 COUNCIL]\n\n\n\n**Note from O5-\u2588\u2588:** The question has been repeatedly raised of why we will not consider methods of reality protection as a replacement of Project Palisade. The answer is simple. Project Palisade works. All our projections and analyses have shown that Project Palisade is a complete guarantee of working. We will not take risks with the very existence of mainline reality.

Sometimes I think we're all just caught up in a fever dream, like we're all in a bottle somewhere being experimented on by some outsider seeing what the Foundation would do given all the power we could imagine and an excuse to justify anything. Sometimes I wonder if this is why no one has come to stop us. If not God or gods, surely there must be something out there, surely there must be something that values the infinite uncountable lives we've sacrificed.
