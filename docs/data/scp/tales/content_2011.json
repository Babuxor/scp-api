The man is skinny, too skinny, and he looks like a corn stalk, but, eminently polite, he leaves his hat off and bows to the girl all the same.</p>\n<p>She blinks at him, and Mr. Feather immediately knows what she thinks- she\u2019s six or seven, just where things that can\u2019t happen have just come apart from things that can happen, and Mr. Feather is one of those: men don\u2019t exist who can drift off the tallest hillside in the state and not be all broken and twisted. And he got up again.</p>\n<p>The girl turns tail and runs. Mr. Feather smiles and follows her. Something is flapping in his chest. She doesn\u2019t know him yet\u2014Mr. Feather can always fall and never break.</p>\n<p>At her home, the girl\u2019s mother cooks dinner for the two of them, when Mr. Feather knocks on her door. He is, she thinks, so <em>thin</em>, that when he gently tells her, \u201cMadam, my car broke down up the road- if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m very hungry, I have a blood condition-\u201d He stops once she smiles a little, won over, embarrassed for his plight. \u201cWell, let me look in the fridge, I might have some fruit\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Her girl, the black-haired one, stands in the hallway and stares at him. He looks at her, but feels a familiar gentle tug in his chest\u2014there is a bird living there, and it just woke up. His vision goes a little faint-colored, and the girl\u2019s gaze passes through him.</p>\n<p>\u201cActually, pardon me, madam-\u201d Just as she turns towards the refrigerator, it slips and he tumbles over the house\u2019s railing. Out, down, over the deck and the manicured suburban lawn- the grass hardly touches him. It slips a little further so that when he blows towards a chainlink fence and passes through it- now comes the interpass, three cars swerve out of his way, a motorcycle slows down as he <em>whooshes</em> past. Two car drivers talk when they pass by- tumbleweeds don\u2019t grow around here, do they? Must be construction. Heels over head and around and around, he falls to rest in a ditch full of ivy, and comes back slowly, wincing.</p>\n<p>Sighing, he gets up again, putting on his hat. It wouldn\u2019t do to forget it. If Redd is really there when he arrives, he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019ll do, but these days the memory of Ms. Sweetie- well, Sweetheart, he called her- is enough to keep him going. Sugar and Feathers were always a good combination, right? Light, lovable, and halfway intangible and breakable- well, no. Not that. For that reason alone, it could have never worked.</p>\n<p>Mr. Feather feels for the feather in his hat, adjusts it, and keeps walking. With any luck, he\u2019ll hitch a ride. Night falls on the highway, and he walks and he walks and the birds fly home around him.</p>\n<p>Previous: <a href=\"/interval-2\">Interval 2</a> by Salman Corbette<br/></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>Next: <a href=\"/mr-laugh\">12.

She doesn\u2019t know him yet--Mr. Feather can always fall and never break. \n\n\n\nAt her home, the girl\u2019s mother cooks dinner for the two of them, when Mr. Feather knocks on her door. He is, she thinks, so //thin//, that when he gently tells her, \u201cMadam, my car broke down up the road- if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m very hungry, I have a blood condition-\u201d He stops once she smiles a little, won over, embarrassed for his plight. \u201cWell, let me look in the fridge, I might have some fruit\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nHer girl, the black-haired one, stands in the hallway and stares at him. He looks at her, but feels a familiar gentle tug in his chest--there is a bird living there, and it just woke up. His vision goes a little faint-colored, and the girl\u2019s gaze passes through him. \n\n\n\n\u201cActually, pardon me, madam-\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Just as she turns towards the refrigerator, it slips and he tumbles over the house\u2019s railing. Out, down, over the deck and the manicured suburban lawn- the grass hardly touches him. It slips a little further so that when he blows towards a chainlink fence and passes through it- now comes the interpass, three cars swerve out of his way, a motorcycle slows down as he //whooshes// past. Two car drivers talk when they pass by- tumbleweeds don\u2019t grow around here, do they? Must be construction. Heels over head and around and around, he falls to rest in a ditch full of ivy, and comes back slowly, wincing.\n\n\n\nSighing, he gets up again, putting on his hat. It wouldn\u2019t do to forget it. If Redd is really there when he arrives, he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019ll do, but these days the memory of Ms. Sweetie- well, Sweetheart, he called her- is enough to keep him going. Sugar and Feathers were always a good combination, right? Light, lovable, and halfway intangible and breakable- well, no. Not that. For that reason alone, it could have never worked.\n\n\n\nMr. Feather feels for the feather in his hat, adjusts it, and keeps walking. With any luck, he\u2019ll hitch a ride. Night falls on the highway, and he walks and he walks and the birds fly home around him.\n\n\n\nPrevious: [[[Interval 2]]] by Salman Corbette\n\n[[>]]\n\nNext: [[[mr-laugh|12.

The only Miss in the first few batches of Misters. Like the one girl Smurf. You know, women make up more than half the world's population. You've got to admit that just one token female character is messed up.</p>\n<p>You've got questions? Well, so do I. Yeah, I don't really know where we come from here. Most of us don't. Our memories get confused\u2026 especially with the tweaking. Most of us have had to be tweaked from time to time. I suspect some of my brothers might have your answers, but I couldn't tell you which.</p>\n<p>Did I start off human? Did I have a life before becoming a Little Mister - well, a Little Miss, in my case? I don't know. I don't remember. Rather, I guess I should say I have a lot of memories. Many of them don't actually match with each other. I remember three different fifteenth birthdays, one of which was a quincea\u00f1era. I don't show up in any missing persons database - I checked. Maybe this isn't my original face. Or my original body. In fact, in at least one of my sets of memories, I'm male. Some nights I stay awake and wonder if that's who I really am - some guy in his mid-twenties who got snatched off the street and reworked into some sick person's wet dream of a female. Incidentally, my chromosomes don't come up either XX <em>or</em> XY. Maybe all I am is a production error.</p>\n<p>I do know that the Wondertainment people have tried majorly tweaking my personality at least three times, probably more that they made me forget. \"Rebellious\", one of them called me. \"Problem\". Won't stick to the theme, they said. Not sweet or girly enough to be Ms. Sweetie, which is a bit unfair if you ask me.</p>\n<p>Superpower. Huh. Yeah, I don't think of them as 'superpowers'. They're my \u2026 nature, if you will. I'll admit my nature is a little creepy. Though it's not as bad as my first edition, where I was a person made up entirely of sweets and sugary confections rather than flesh and blood. I had health problems like you wouldn't believe. I could still feel pain and get sick, except every virus affected me in new and exciting and truly disgusting ways. After one accident where I vomited sugar-plum pudding for two weeks solid, the Wondertainment people scrapped that nature altogether. Made me flesh and blood again. Now, I'm basically just like a normal human, except that everyone who sees me loves me. Whether it's platonic, romantic, or more like the love you have for a pet or\u2026 the other definitions of love\u2026 that's up to the person. Which hasn't always worked out so well for me.</p>\n<p>That isn't the only way I'm 'sweet'. I've always had a compassionate streak a mile wide. I'm a really caring person, more than I should be - it's kind of embarrassing, actually. I remember that I used to get some flack for it\u2026 and I think I can trust that memory, because I don't think Wondertainment would implant a memory that contradicts my \"theme\". Unless they're cleverer than I think, playing a bit of reverse psychology on me\u2026 But I sincerely doubt they're that smart. You know, during one of their \"tweaks\" they actually tried to make me <em>stupid</em>. What does that tell you, eh? I haven't forgiven them for that. If there's a single person behind the Dr. Wondertainment moniker, you can bet that person has a penis.</p>\n<p>I don't mind the name Ms. Sweetie as much as you might think, by the way. It's\u2026 iconic. Kind of a lame icon as icons go, but in my position, you take what you can get.</p>\n<p>Being the only woman on most of the Little Mister lists makes for some interesting dynamics. Several of the other Misters fell in love with me, or at least said they did while also acting like moony teenagers. Like Mr. Mission. And Mr. Storm. And Mr. Feather. And at least half the others who weren't busy seeing me as their mommy. That would be bad enough by itself. Plus, I don't think I'm exactly interested. In men. At all. So when I said 'interesting' I actually meant 'really shitty'.</p>\n<p>Did any of that sound harsh? I didn't mean it to. I like them. I really do. I care about them, even. I like them all, even Mr. Stripes. All except\u2026</p>\n<p>I still remember. Wondertainment tried to wipe my memory but it wouldn't take, not for this. I like to think it wouldn't help. It's not going to help to explain it, either. No, it wasn't rape. I don't even think Stripes comprehends that idea. It just wouldn't help to explain what happened. You wouldn't understand it anyway. Just remember this \u2014 he did it with adoration in his eyes.</p>\n<p>I have to find him. I need to get to him before Mr. Stripes, or Mr. Mad, or any of the others.</p>\n<p>Not all the others know the specific details. A couple of them know a little bit. Most of the others heard about it, of course. Word gets around. Now, apparently, a whole bunch of them are coming for Mr. Redd. I didn't send them, but when you're the only woman in a roomful of guys, the men either objectify you, put you on a pedestal, or both. Which means that I may as well be Ms. Damsel-In-Distress, and they are all Mr. White-Knights.</p>\n<p>Maybe I should tell them I suspect I started off a man. But maybe they'd turn on me too. I remember what Wondertainment did to Mr. Hot when they caught him kissing\u2026 No, I'm not going to think about that.</p>\n<p>I suppose I can't object too much. It wasn't just me that Mr. Redd hurt. I'm not even sure I was the worst. Just the most public.</p>\n<p>But I don't want them to find Mr. Redd. Because I'm <em>not</em> a damsel in distress. As much as Wondertainment has tried to make me that way. The others, they talk about avenging my memory, like I'm dead and gone like some <em>human.</em> Ha. I wish. But they're really just avenging the way I was before - innocent, naive, \u2026stupid. Yeah, I'll never go back to the way I was before, but <em>I'm still here.</em> I don't need their efforts. I'm not just some victim.</p>\n<p>I've got plans. Not just the obvious. Sure, I've got the handgun in my pocket, and yeah, I'm gonna at least <em>try</em> to shoot him in the face. Sort of an obligation at this point. But that's just for starters. Being honest, I expect to go down for a while when the endgame starts. I know Mr. Redd. You can't beat him head to head like that. But it'll all unwind by the time it's over. You wouldn't believe the kinds of resources and connections you can pile up when everyone thinks they love you. I wish I could be there when he finally gets taken\u2026 Or when he sees my face again, in the containment cell, for hopefully the last time\u2026</p>\n<p>I always liked the Foundation, really. There are worse ways to spend the rest of your life.</p>\n<p>What was the name of that old poem? From that collection they gave me when they were trying to make me properly feminine? Ah, yes. <em>\"Vengeance is sweet.\"</em></p>\n<p>See, it even fits my theme.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Previous: <a href=\"/14-mr-brass\">14.

The only Miss in the first few batches of Misters. Like the one girl Smurf. You know, women make up more than half the world's population. You've got to admit that just one token female character is messed up.\n\n\n\nYou've got questions? Well, so do I. Yeah, I don't really know where we come from here. Most of us don't. Our memories get confused... especially with the tweaking. Most of us have had to be tweaked from time to time. I suspect some of my brothers might have your answers, but I couldn't tell you which.\n\n\n\nDid I start off human? Did I have a life before becoming a Little Mister - well, a Little Miss, in my case? I don't know. I don't remember. Rather, I guess I should say I have a lot of memories. Many of them don't actually match with each other. I remember three different fifteenth birthdays, one of which was a quincea\u00f1era. I don't show up in any missing persons database - I checked. Maybe this isn't my original face. Or my original body. In fact, in at least one of my sets of memories, I'm male. Some nights I stay awake and wonder if that's who I really am - some guy in his mid-twenties who got snatched off the street and reworked into some sick person's wet dream of a female. Incidentally, my chromosomes don't come up either XX //or// XY. Maybe all I am is a production error.\n\n\n\nI do know that the Wondertainment people have tried majorly tweaking my personality at least three times, probably more that they made me forget. \"Rebellious\", one of them called me. \"Problem\". Won't stick to the theme, they said. Not sweet or girly enough to be Ms. Sweetie, which is a bit unfair if you ask me. \n\n\n\nSuperpower. Huh. Yeah, I don't think of them as 'superpowers'. They're my ... nature, if you will. I'll admit my nature is a little creepy. Though it's not as bad as my first edition, where I was a person made up entirely of sweets and sugary confections rather than flesh and blood. I had health problems like you wouldn't believe. I could still feel pain and get sick, except every virus affected me in new and exciting and truly disgusting ways. After one accident where I vomited sugar-plum pudding for two weeks solid, the Wondertainment people scrapped that nature altogether. Made me flesh and blood again. Now, I'm basically just like a normal human, except that everyone who sees me loves me. Whether it's platonic, romantic, or more like the love you have for a pet or... the other definitions of love... that's up to the person. Which hasn't always worked out so well for me.\n\n\n\nThat isn't the only way I'm 'sweet'. I've always had a compassionate streak a mile wide. I'm a really caring person, more than I should be - it's kind of embarrassing, actually. I remember that I used to get some flack for it... and I think I can trust that memory, because I don't think Wondertainment would implant a memory that contradicts my \"theme\". Unless they're cleverer than I think, playing a bit of reverse psychology on me... But I sincerely doubt they're that smart. You know, during one of their \"tweaks\" they actually tried to make me //stupid//. What does that tell you, eh? I haven't forgiven them for that. If there's a single person behind the Dr. Wondertainment moniker, you can bet that person has a penis.\n\n\n\nI don't mind the name Ms. Sweetie as much as you might think, by the way. It's... iconic. Kind of a lame icon as icons go, but in my position, you take what you can get.\n\n\n\nBeing the only woman on most of the Little Mister lists makes for some interesting dynamics. Several of the other Misters fell in love with me, or at least said they did while also acting like moony teenagers. Like Mr. Mission. And Mr. Storm. And Mr. Feather. And at least half the others who weren't busy seeing me as their mommy. That would be bad enough by itself. Plus, I don't think I'm exactly interested. In men. At all. So when I said 'interesting' I actually meant 'really shitty'.\n\n\n\nDid any of that sound harsh? I didn't mean it to. I like them. I really do. I care about them, even. I like them all, even Mr. Stripes. All except...\n\n\n\nI still remember. Wondertainment tried to wipe my memory but it wouldn't take, not for this. I like to think it wouldn't help. It's not going to help to explain it, either. No, it wasn't rape. I don't even think Stripes comprehends that idea. It just wouldn't help to explain what happened. You wouldn't understand it anyway. Just remember this -- he did it with adoration in his eyes.\n\n\n\nI have to find him. I need to get to him before Mr. Stripes, or Mr. Mad, or any of the others.\n\n\n\nNot all the others know the specific details. A couple of them know a little bit. Most of the others heard about it, of course. Word gets around. Now, apparently, a whole bunch of them are coming for Mr. Redd. I didn't send them, but when you're the only woman in a roomful of guys, the men either objectify you, put you on a pedestal, or both. Which means that I may as well be Ms. Damsel-In-Distress, and they are all Mr. White-Knights.\n\n\n\nMaybe I should tell them I suspect I started off a man. But maybe they'd turn on me too. I remember what Wondertainment did to Mr. Hot when they caught him kissing... No, I'm not going to think about that.\n\n\n\nI suppose I can't object too much. It wasn't just me that Mr. Redd hurt. I'm not even sure I was the worst. Just the most public.\n\n\n\nBut I don't want them to find Mr. Redd. Because I'm //not// a damsel in distress. As much as Wondertainment has tried to make me that way.\u00a0\u00a0The others, they talk about avenging my memory, like I'm dead and gone like some //human.// Ha. I wish. But they're really just avenging the way I was before - innocent, naive, ...stupid. Yeah, I'll never go back to the way I was before, but //I'm still here.// I don't need their efforts. I'm not just some victim.\n\n\n\nI've got plans. Not just the obvious. Sure, I've got the handgun in my pocket, and yeah, I'm gonna at least //try// to shoot him in the face. Sort of an obligation at this point. But that's just for starters. Being honest, I expect to go down for a while when the endgame starts. I know Mr. Redd. You can't beat him head to head like that. But it'll all unwind by the time it's over. You wouldn't believe the kinds of resources and connections you can pile up when everyone thinks they love you. I wish I could be there when he finally gets taken... Or when he sees my face again, in the containment cell, for hopefully the last time...\n\n\n\nI always liked the Foundation, really. There are worse ways to spend the rest of your life.\n\n\n\nWhat was the name of that old poem? From that collection they gave me when they were trying to make me properly feminine? Ah, yes. //\"Vengeance is sweet.\"// \n\n\n\nSee, it even fits my theme.\n\n\n\n--------\n\n\n\nPrevious: [[[14. Mr. Brass]]] by Grand Ender\n\n[[>]]\n\nNext: [[[mr-fish|16.

The magician, although skilled and pretty, hadn't performed anything other than the usual misdirection which could be seen anywhere. The hoop aerialist, who was also very pretty and wearing a costume that left very little to the imagination, did little more than spin in her ring in various positions and look seductive. There was very little of what many considered the MC&amp;D flavor.</p>\n<p>The curtain closed around the stage as she finished her act and bowed. Polite applause sounded from the audience, along with a few barely audible disappointed sighs. When the curtain reopened, the hoop had been replaced with a pair of white ribbon-like straps. A man built like a ballet dancer with bare arms and feet stood next to the straps, ready to perform.</p>\n<p>Music started playing. It was a peaceful melody, light and uplifting. The acrobat lifted himself onto the straps and started his act. At first the act looked as though it was going to be as ordinary as the other performances. He wrapped straps around himself like the stripes on a candy cane. He hung himself upside down, spun himself in circles, and held himself parallel to the ground while holding onto the straps solely with his hands. He contorted his body into grotesque shapes which could only be achieved with the help of the straps. He somersaulted upwards, spiraling the ribbons around his arms. The audience sat in silence through all these moves.</p>\n<p>The aerialist wrapped himself up asymmetrically. One strap spiraled down his leg, while the other wrapped tightly around his left bicep. There was a twist, a sudden drop, and a note of discord in the music. He now was hanging upside down from the one wrapped leg while the other strap hung down, not wrapped around anything. His left hand was still gripping it, but his arm had been severed where the strap had been wrapped.</p>\n<p>There was no blood, and the aerialist continued to climb and twist himself on the straps unfazed. The arm climbed too, wrapping the strap around itself and alternating between gripping with the hand and the elbow. No wound on either end of the arm, only an expanse of white where bone, sinew, and other tissues should have been visible.</p>\n<p>The act now seemed to be a strange kind of partner acrobatics; a one-armed man and a single arm both performing tricks. Sometimes the tricks were separate, and sometimes they were in tandem, resulting in holds and balances that should have been impossible. The arm helped him into another wrap, this one around both legs. The aerialist balanced himself like a board for a few seconds while the severed arm held itself straight out above him.</p>\n<p>There was another twist, a discordant note in the music, drop, and he again hung by one leg. His right leg had been severed this time and joined the performance as a separate entity. Less than a minute later, his right arm joined the act.</p>\n<p>The music began to swell as the severed limbs, all moving of their own accord, helped the aerialist into position for what could be one final trick. His one remaining leg wrapped in a candy cane swirl, as his severed arms wrapped the other strap around his neck, bringing him into a horizontal balance. One hand then brought the strap down and over his throat quickly, enclosing his neck.</p>\n<p>The body once again was hanging upside down, suspended through a wrap around the left leg. The head rolled on the floor. It was just as neatly severed as the three limbs that were no longer attached to the suspended torso. His head finished rolling and faced the assemblage of wealth and power. The music still played, but the show was likely over.</p>\n<p>While the audience sat in stunned silence, the magician from earlier entered the stage. She looked at the hanging body, the severed limbs, and the head. Her expression, rather than horrified, seemed bemused. She glared at the aerialist's severed head, which returned her expression with a sheepish smile. Shaking her head, she started collecting his parts. One by one, she reattached them to his body, wrapping a section of strap around each one. He moved each reattached part into his suspension, keeping himself aloft with his strength until he was once again whole. Finally, he rolled down the straps to the ground, stood up with the magician, and bowed.</p>\n<p>The audience applauded thunderously.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/a-circus-for-mc-d-ltd\">A Circus for MC&amp;D Ltd</a>\" by Tara Unknown, from the <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Marginally better.</p>\n<p>He sighed and turned the page, reading about how Site-11 would\u2014once again\u2014be taking home the intersite softball championship. It was, of course, because O5-3 had money on Site-11 and got all the best players transferred there, but everyone thought that -3 was crazy, so he got away with it. He wasn\u2019t really crazy. None of them were. But that didn\u2019t stop the impression from reaching Clef as well.</p>\n<p>He stood up, stretching and staring into the toilet. He nodded once in approval and flushed, folding the paper and putting it under his arm as he walked out into his quarters. It was a mess, of course. His most recent assistant wasn\u2019t as proficient as the last one. He sighed, throwing the paper in the trash and pawing through piles of clothes until he found a pair of underwear that looked mostly clean, and pulling them on.</p>\n<p>He went to his closet, getting out an older pair of slacks, sitting down on the bed to get them on, and then adding a sweat stained white shirt and lab coat to the mix. He sighed, pushing himself up from the bed and trundling out of the room, pushing his hair back from his forehead. \u2018I\u2019m going to get a haircut today,\u2019 he thought, going to the door and opening it into the quiet corridor.</p>\n<p>Seniority had its advantages, and one of them was calling your own projects. Clef had been without one for almost eight months, but no one said anything. Years of service were generally rewarded with placidity in the Foundation, until the shit hit the fan. Then, all the new kids would be running to him, to Gears, to Crow, all begging and pleading, telling them what stupid idea they tried and what moronic consequences it had.</p>\n<p>He rounded the corner just in time to see his assistant cleaning dirt out from under her fingernails with a nail file. He\u2019d chosen her for the massive tits she sported, but now\u2026 They just seemed like wasted space. He stared at them nonetheless.</p>\n<p>\u201cMorning, sir,\u201d she said passively, pressing her breasts together slightly and raising them, believing that they\u2014rather than boredom\u2014were the source of his apathy toward her performance.</p>\n<p>He stared for a few minutes more, going on past her, heading toward the site barber. It was the middle of the work day, so the room was mostly empty. \u201cHey, Ernie,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Bert,\u201d the barber replied. It was an old, tired joke\u2014the kind that people still laughed at politely because the man was old and amicable. Clef did his duty, emitting a dry chuckle, and sat in a creaking chair off to the side. In a moment, the young agent in the chair stood, thanked the barber, and passed him a ten. He accepted it, smiled, and waved the young man on his way.</p>\n<p>As Clef got up and headed to the chair, he cocked his eyebrow. \u201cNew kid doesn\u2019t know not to pay you yet?\u201d he asked, shifting himself into it.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey never do,\u201d Ernie replied.</p>\n<p>Clef\u2019s thinning hair made the job quick, and as the barber combed it, he said as much. Clef shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m getting old enough for it,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Ernie knocked the stray hair from the man\u2019s shoulders, undoing the barber\u2019s cape, and then holding out his hand. Clef smirked and shook his head, laughing genuinely as he left the room, his stomach rumbling slightly.</p>\n<p>He made his way to the mess, entering it to no cheer or pomp, only to the occasional glance and nod from a friend or coworker. Those were both few. He entered the line, taking a roast beef sandwich and a bag of potato chips, as well as an extra pudding cup. It moved forward slowly, a couple of shuffling steps at a time.

Marginally better.\n\n\n\nHe sighed and turned the page, reading about how Site-11 would\u2014once again\u2014be taking home the intersite softball championship. It was, of course, because O5-3 had money on Site-11 and got all the best players transferred there, but everyone thought that -3 was crazy, so he got away with it.\u00a0\u00a0He wasn\u2019t really crazy. None of them were. But that didn\u2019t stop the impression from reaching Clef as well.\n\n\n\nHe stood up, stretching and staring into the toilet. He nodded once in approval and flushed, folding the paper and putting it under his arm as he walked out into his quarters.\u00a0\u00a0It was a mess, of course. His most recent assistant wasn\u2019t as proficient as the last one.\u00a0\u00a0He sighed, throwing the paper in the trash and pawing through piles of clothes until he found a pair of underwear that looked mostly clean, and pulling them on.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nHe went to his closet, getting out an older pair of slacks, sitting down on the bed to get them on, and then adding a sweat stained white shirt and lab coat to the mix. He sighed, pushing himself up from the bed and trundling out of the room, pushing his hair back from his forehead. \u2018I\u2019m going to get a haircut today,\u2019 he thought, going to the door and opening it into the quiet corridor. \n\n\n\nSeniority had its advantages, and one of them was calling your own projects. Clef had been without one for almost eight months, but no one said anything.\u00a0\u00a0Years of service were generally rewarded with placidity in the Foundation, until the shit hit the fan. Then, all the new kids would be running to him, to Gears, to Crow, all begging and pleading, telling them what stupid idea they tried and what moronic consequences it had.\n\n\n\nHe rounded the corner just in time to see his assistant cleaning dirt out from under her fingernails with a nail file.\u00a0\u00a0He\u2019d chosen her for the massive tits she sported, but now\u2026 They just seemed like wasted space. He stared at them nonetheless. \n\n\n\n\u201cMorning, sir,\u201d she said passively, pressing her breasts together slightly and raising them, believing that they\u2014rather than boredom\u2014were the source of his apathy toward her performance. \n\n\n\nHe stared for a few minutes more, going on past her, heading toward the site barber.\u00a0\u00a0It was the middle of the work day, so the room was mostly empty. \u201cHey, Ernie,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cHey, Bert,\u201d the barber replied. It was an old, tired joke\u2014the kind that people still laughed at politely because the man was old and amicable. Clef did his duty, emitting a dry chuckle, and sat in a creaking chair off to the side.\u00a0\u00a0In a moment, the young agent in the chair stood, thanked the barber, and passed him a ten.\u00a0\u00a0He accepted it, smiled, and waved the young man on his way.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nAs Clef got up and headed to the chair, he cocked his eyebrow. \u201cNew kid doesn\u2019t know not to pay you yet?\u201d he asked, shifting himself into it. \n\n\n\n\u201cThey never do,\u201d Ernie replied.\n\n\n\nClef\u2019s thinning hair made the job quick, and as the barber combed it, he said as much.\u00a0\u00a0Clef shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m getting old enough for it,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nErnie knocked the stray hair from the man\u2019s shoulders, undoing the barber\u2019s cape, and then holding out his hand. Clef smirked and shook his head, laughing genuinely as he left the room, his stomach rumbling slightly. \n\n\n\nHe made his way to the mess, entering it to no cheer or pomp, only to the occasional glance and nod from a friend or coworker.\u00a0\u00a0Those were both few.\u00a0\u00a0He entered the line, taking a roast beef sandwich and a bag of potato chips, as well as an extra pudding cup. It moved forward slowly, a couple of shuffling steps at a time. He yawned as he showed the woman his meal card; she nodded; and he headed to a quiet table.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nHe sat alone, eating the pudding cups first, then staring at the sandwich. He noted how\u00a0\u00a0dry the beef was as he bit into it, frowning slightly and realizing that he\u2019d have to go through the whole line again to get a damned cola.\u00a0\u00a0He sat there instead, chewing, eating a dry sandwich and wishing\u2014longing\u2014for a containment breach, an assassination attempt, a god damned green. //Anything//, really.\n\n\n\nBut it never came. And as he finished chewing, he got up, threw his plate in the garbage, and headed back to his quarters for his bottle of scotch.\u00a0\u00a0Another exciting day ending at noon.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nHe passed Gears on the way out, nodding to him and the younger agent\u2014who was hanging onto his every word, laughing and trying to joke unsuccessfully with the bald doctor\u2014and decided for the tenth time to fire his assistant.\u00a0\u00a0But she really did have such lovely tits.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[!-- N/A (No Images)\u00a0\u00a0--]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "licensing-guide", "licensing-master-list"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "doctor-clef", "doctor-gears", "kain-pathos-crow", "tale"], "title": "A Day in the Life of Alto Clef - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/a-day-in-the-life-of-alto-clef", "year": 2011}, "a-few-memos": {"created_at": "2011-06-04T20:42:00", "creator": "Salman Corbette", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Salman Corbette", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/salman-corbette", "comment": "", "date": "2011-06-04T20:42:00"}, {"author": "Salman Corbette", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/salman-corbette", "comment": "Added rating module", "date": "2011-06-04T20:48:00"}, {"author": "Salman Corbette", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/salman-corbette", "comment": "Added tags: contest, factory, story.

It generated an antibiotic more potent than any modern medicine can create. The creature had latched on to the female's spinal cord between the T12 and L1 vertebrae. It had entrenched itself into it, melding its blood vessels and nervous system to hers. It was a difficult operation to remove it, but we managed it. The creature would revolutionize the medical industry, if we could perfect and synthesize the antibiotics. We moved the creature into the ICU. We disposed of the body. She was pretty, but she had served her purpose.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday I researched the effects of SCP-078 on schizophrenic patients.</p>\n<p>There were four trials, each with a different test subject: an elderly male and female, and a young male and female. I was interested in seeing what happens to the effects of 078 when exposed to a damaged psyche. Of course, death was always an outcome, but if a few hours of clear data was recorded, any end to the test subjects would have been worth it. The young male and female were particularly interesting. We have a clear recording of their descent into apathy and depression. One subject, the female, found ways of self-mutilation using only her fingernails. We were eventually forced to euthanize all four.

It generated an antibiotic more potent than any modern medicine can create. The creature had latched on to the female's spinal cord between the T12 and L1 vertebrae. It had entrenched itself into it, melding its blood vessels and nervous system to hers. It was a difficult operation to remove it, but we managed it. The creature would revolutionize the medical industry, if we could perfect and synthesize the antibiotics. We moved the creature into the ICU. We disposed of the body. She was pretty, but she had served her purpose.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday I researched the effects of SCP-078 on schizophrenic patients.\n\n\n\nThere were four trials, each with a different test subject: an elderly male and female, and a young male and female. I was interested in seeing what happens to the effects of 078 when exposed to a damaged psyche. Of course, death was always an outcome, but if a few hours of clear data was recorded, any end to the test subjects would have been worth it. The young male and female were particularly interesting. We have a clear recording of their descent into apathy and depression. One subject, the female, found ways of self-mutilation using only her fingernails. We were eventually forced to euthanize all four. A pity - the data we got from them were important to our research.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday I lobotomized a human subject who was exposed to SCP-215.\n\n\n\nIt was irritating.

We're lodged at the local inn. It seems Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588' unwelcome guest has become the talk of the town; it was the first thing the receptionist spoke of after we checked in. According to the receptionist, Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 spent the evening of June \u2588 here, claiming his \u201cguest\u201d followed him. The receptionist described him as seeming disheveled, desperate, and drunk. She insisted she'd known \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 his whole life, that his lifelong sobriety was something he took pride in. She also noted that, despite his impaired coordination and slurred speech, he seemed deeply offended when she suggested he'd been seeking refuge in a bottle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>June \u2588, 18\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>Conversed with Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 for several hours in his home. He had a great deal of difficulty focusing during our conversation, and by my estimate, reintroduced himself at least twice in ten minutes as if he'd never seen us before. Both times, he did so with his hand on the stock of a double-barreled shotgun resting beside the arm chair he occupied. A consensus was reached on the subject of Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588' possession of firearms in short order.</p>\n<p>According to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, this phantom which has been hounding him possesses physical form and appears as a silhouette. Neither myself nor my partner, Agent Hachigan, have observed this. We were, however, privy to some interesting phenomena over the course of the conversation. By interesting, I mean my revolver liberated itself from its holster, rotating slowly in mid-air and discharging seemingly at random before the weapon dropped to the floor. Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was considerably startled by the event, as were my partner and I, though he quickly regained composure and laughed, claiming \u201cthe ghost scared itself senseless.\u201d \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 seemed unconcerned about the damage done to his property.</p>\n<p>Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 has agreed to a meeting outside the residence tomorrow. We're keeping his guns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>June \u2588, 18\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>Spoke with \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 at a local bar. Upon seeing Agent Hachigan and I, Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 immediately informed us he had been followed once more by his unwelcome guest, facetiously referring to it as \u201cUmbra.\u201d Agent Hachigan and myself remain unable to see the entity.</p>\n<p>Our second meeting proved much less eventful than the first. No errant gunshots to report, though a newspaper left unattended at a nearby table unfolded itself in singularly bizarre fashion after Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 asked if either myself or Hachigan saw anything of import in today's news. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 claims to be unable to read anymore, something he attributes to Umbra's presence.</p>\n<p>Hachigan and I are of the opinion that Umbra doesn't exist. We believe \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is responsible for these phenomena. Why he felt it necessary to attribute them to this invented Umbra, I don't know. It is possible that he's genuinely unaware of his role in the situation, and this Umbra was invented to fill in the blanks, as it were.</p>\n<p>In any case, Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 has agreed to accompany Agent Hachigan and myself to Installation \u2588. He's under the impression we're taking him to a medical facility to treat his decline in mental health. Hachigan insists we avoid forms of transit which could allow for any additional witnesses en route to Installation \u2588.</p>\n<p>\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and I will depart tonight. After Agent Hachigan ensures Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588' home is free of any objects of interest, he'll meet up with us after razing the residence. A cover story has been submitted via the usual channels.</p>\n<p>I can't wait until this assignment is over.

He was on duty as the events of June 11th unfolded and subsequently tasked with overseeing the entombment of Exam Room 3. This interview is to allow formal documentation of activity observed by Mr. Thomas.</p>\n<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Andrew:</strong> I know these past few days have been exhausting for you, so I'll try to keep this brief. What was your involvement in the events of June 11th?</p>\n<p><strong>Thomas:</strong> Day started normal enough, until some Level 4 pulls me off patrol duty, tells me to camp the hall outside Exam Room 3 with a shotgun. Tells me to blast anyone that so much as pokes their head out of the door before he takes off down the hallway. No clue where he ran off to.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Andrew:</strong> Then what happened?</p>\n<p><strong>Thomas:</strong> Heard gunshots and some shouting. Quiet for a while, then more gunshots. I kept note of the times. Few minutes after that, Dr. Jared opened the door, tried to exit the room. The door slammed shut on his arm; I think I heard a <em>crack</em>. He had a manila envelope in his hand, threw it into the hallway.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Andrew:</strong> Continue.</p>\n<p><strong>Thomas:</strong> He looked me straight in the eyes, something beyond mortal terror on his face. Begged me [DATA EXPUNGED] and I hesitated\u2026 I don't think I'll ever forgive myself for that. Looked like he was doing his damnedest to force that door open. Something must have been holding it closed from the inside. I reckon something was trying to drag him back in.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Andrew:</strong> Why is that?</p>\n<p><strong>Thomas:</strong> After about a minute, it was only his fingers wrapped around the edge of the door, blood dripping from his hand onto the floor. Sounded like something rammed the door trying to force it shut, Dr. Jared screamed in pain, and his fingers were severed between the door and its frame. Whatever it was, though, it didn't want him dead. He was still alive three days later, when we sealed the room up air-tight. Could hear him in there praying, pleading, rambling incoherently\u2026 occasionally screaming.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Andrew:</strong> If you'd like to pau -</p>\n<p><strong>Thomas:</strong> No, Doc, I'm fine. The thing that bothered me the most was that the screaming, that was always followed by the smell of burning flesh.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Andrew:</strong> Flesh?</p>\n<p><strong>Thomas:</strong> Human flesh. That smell, once you know it, you can't mistake it for anything else. I was a dumb kid with my first six shooter, picked up a spent casing right after reloading. Didn't make that mistake twice.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Andrew:</strong> That will be all, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.</p>\n<p><strong>&lt;End Log&gt;</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n</div></body></html>", "raw_source": "\n\t[[>]]\n\n[[module Rate]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n[[size 0%]]Some time in early June 18\u2588\u2588, a number of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Tennessee area newspapers began carrying stories of a haunting at the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 residence, located at \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Road.[[/size]]\n\n\n\n[[toc]]\n\n\n\n+ Abridged Timeline of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588 Acquisition\n\n\n\n* Some time in early June 18\u2588\u2588, a number of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Tennessee area newspapers began carrying stories of a haunting at the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 residence, located at \u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Road.\n\n\u00a0* Field Agents Went and Hachigan held several conversations with Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, both at his residence and elsewhere. Phenomena witnessed during interviews not conducted at the residence seemed to suggest that Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 himself was causally responsible for the reported \u201cpoltergeist\u201d activity, although he appeared oblivious to this fact.\n\n\u00a0* Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was persuaded to accompany Agents Went and Hachigan to Research Installation \u2588 under the pretense he would receive treatment for his rapid decline in mental faculties. Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was told the facility was a medical institution.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0* After Agent Hachigan established no objects of interest were in the home, the residence was razed. A cover story was concocted in which Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 fled his residence in terror in the dead of night, breaking a kerosene lamp in his bid to escape. This story was widely circulated by regional newspapers.\n\n\n\n* Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 arrived with Agents Went and Hachigan at Research Installation \u2588 on the 11th of June, 18\u2588\u2588 at 10:30 am local time.\n\n\u00a0* Six (6) individuals signed in to Exam Room 3 shortly after Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588' arrival:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0* Dr. Jared, lead interviewer and researcher assigned to the investigation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0* Dr. Bianchi, assistant to Dr. Jared\n\n\u00a0\u00a0* Agent Hachigan, witness and security\n\n\u00a0\u00a0* Agent Went, witness and security\n\n\u00a0\u00a0* Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, interviewee\n\n\u00a0\u00a0* Richard Pierfax, stenographer\n\n\u00a0* 11:47 am: A handwritten note was slid underneath the door, signed by Dr. Jared.\n\n\u00a0* 11:50 am: Three gunshots were heard within Exam Room 3, followed briefly by panicked shouting.\n\n\u00a0* 12:02 pm: Two additional gunshots were reported.\n\n\u00a0* 12:12 pm: The door to Exam Room 3 was cracked open and a manilla envelope was thrown into the hallway. Dr. Jared wedged his arm in the door and appeared to make an exhaustive effort to force it open, yelling \u201cFor Christ's sake, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588!\u201d\n\n\u00a0* 12:13 pm: [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n\u00a0* 12:15 pm: Exam Room 3 boarded shut, chimney sealed.\n\n\n\n* On the 13th of June, 18\u2588\u2588, Research Installation \u2588 was re-designated Containment Site \u2588.\n\n\u00a0* Entombment of Exam Room 3 began shortly thereafter.\n\n\n\n+ Agent Went's Log\n\n\n\n> June \u2588, 18\u2588\u2588\n\n> \n\n> Arrived in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 after an uneventful trip. We're lodged at the local inn. It seems Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588' unwelcome guest has become the talk of the town; it was the first thing the receptionist spoke of after we checked in. According to the receptionist, Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 spent the evening of June \u2588 here, claiming his \u201cguest\u201d followed him. The receptionist described him as seeming disheveled, desperate, and drunk. She insisted she'd known \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 his whole life, that his lifelong sobriety was something he took pride in. She also noted that, despite his impaired coordination and slurred speech, he seemed deeply offended when she suggested he'd been seeking refuge in a bottle.\n\n\n\n> June \u2588, 18\u2588\u2588\n\n> \n\n> Conversed with Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 for several hours in his home. He had a great deal of difficulty focusing during our conversation, and by my estimate, reintroduced himself at least twice in ten minutes as if he'd never seen us before. Both times, he did so with his hand on the stock of a double-barreled shotgun resting beside the arm chair he occupied. A consensus was reached on the subject of Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588' possession of firearms in short order.\n\n> \n\n> According to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, this phantom which has been hounding him possesses physical form and appears as a silhouette. Neither myself nor my partner, Agent Hachigan, have observed this. We were, however, privy to some interesting phenomena over the course of the conversation. By interesting, I mean my revolver liberated itself from its holster, rotating slowly in mid-air and discharging seemingly at random before the weapon dropped to the floor. Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was considerably startled by the event, as were my partner and I, though he quickly regained composure and laughed, claiming \u201cthe ghost scared itself senseless.\u201d \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 seemed unconcerned about the damage done to his property.\n\n> \n\n> Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 has agreed to a meeting outside the residence tomorrow. We're keeping his guns.\n\n\n\n> June \u2588, 18\u2588\u2588\n\n> \n\n> Spoke with \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 at a local bar. Upon seeing Agent Hachigan and I, Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 immediately informed us he had been followed once more by his unwelcome guest, facetiously referring to it as \u201cUmbra.\u201d Agent Hachigan and myself remain unable to see the entity.\n\n> \n\n> Our second meeting proved much less eventful than the first. No errant gunshots to report, though a newspaper left unattended at a nearby table unfolded itself in singularly bizarre fashion after Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 asked if either myself or Hachigan saw anything of import in today's news. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 claims to be unable to read anymore, something he attributes to Umbra's presence.\n\n> \n\n> Hachigan and I are of the opinion that Umbra doesn't exist. We believe \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is responsible for these phenomena. Why he felt it necessary to attribute them to this invented Umbra, I don't know. It is possible that he's genuinely unaware of his role in the situation, and this Umbra was invented to fill in the blanks, as it were.\n\n> \n\n> In any case, Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 has agreed to accompany Agent Hachigan and myself to Installation \u2588. He's under the impression we're taking him to a medical facility to treat his decline in mental health. Hachigan insists we avoid forms of transit which could allow for any additional witnesses en route to Installation \u2588.\n\n> \n\n> \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and I will depart tonight. After Agent Hachigan ensures Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588' home is free of any objects of interest, he'll meet up with us after razing the residence. A cover story has been submitted via the usual channels.\n\n> \n\n> I can't wait until this assignment is over. It would be nice to get a good night's sleep again.\n\n\n\n+ Agent Hachigan's \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n[DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n\n\n+ Transcript of Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588' Interview\n\n\n\n> **Interviewed:** Agent Hachigan, Agent Went, Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n> \n\n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Jared\n\n> \n\n> **Foreword:** This interview was ordered by Dr. Jared in order to: verify the observations of Agents Hachigan and Went, test the hypothesis that Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was subconsciously responsible for phenomena observed by Hachigan and Went, determine the appropriate accommodations and treatment for Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and debrief Agents Hachigan and Went.\n\n> \n\n> **<Begin Log>**\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Jared:** Hello, Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. My name is Dr. Jared, but just Doctor will suffice. I understand you've not been yourself lately. Can you describe your symptoms?\n\n> \n\n> **\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:** No... No I can't, Doctor. I could if I were sick - if I were ailing... I'm not. It's this... presence - it won't leave. Ever since it showed up --\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Jared:** I apologize, but I'd like to stop you right there, Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. //When// did you first begin sensing this presence?\n\n> \n\n> **\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:** I can't even tell you what day of the week it is.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Jared:** //(sighs)// Continue where you left off, then.\n\n> \n\n> **\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:** I what? Oh, right. Ever since it showed up, I can't focus \u2013 can't read. Can - but can't process it, you know? When I am able to steady my nerves enough to sleep, I awake the next morning feeling no different than the night before \u2013 just as tired. I don't think Umbra -\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Jared:** Umbra?\n\n> \n\n> **\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:** Name I gave her \u2013 gave it. I don't think she, err... It. Means any harm. It seems curious, inquisitive, even. Doesn't understand English, can't read.

Can you recall when these phenomena began occurring? When you noticed this... Umbra? Whichever came first will suffice.\n\n> \n\n> **\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:** I think... it was when I visited the lake. There was this... odd ripple pattern, odd disturbance \u2013 in the water, like something moving, displacing. Nothing there.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Jared:** Do you think it attributable to aquatic fauna? Intermingling currents or the breeze, perchance?\n\n> \n\n> **\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:** The water was crystal clear, no wind to speak of... I think...\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Jared:** Yes?\n\n> \n\n> **\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:** Everything... in and around the lake was dead \u2013 or dying. Not the trees or plants, but... There were dozens of fish \u2013 frogs, washed up on the shore, birds, and a dozen or so small mammals on the brink. I think that's why I went to the lake. Stench of death \u2013 curiosity...\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Jared:** Surely, you must have told someone?\n\n> \n\n> **\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:** No.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Jared:** No?\n\n> \n\n> **\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:** I thought... some sickness, a blight. Returned home \u2013 shotgun, ax, matches, gloves, shells. Put everything out of its misery \u2013 ran out of shells... Ax. Felled firewood, made a pyre. Burned everything, gloves too.

I confirmed it with Went at the time. I insisted we keep Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 isolated, take measures to isolate ourselves, just in case. When we left, it stayed with \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. We bribed the receptionist at the inn we were staying at to leave us the entire building for a week. Our first meeting outside the residence took place at the inn. After we escorted Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 home, Went put her sixshooter to my head and took my \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, made me swear to keep my mouth shut.

He was on duty as the events of June 11th unfolded and subsequently tasked with overseeing the entombment of Exam Room 3. This interview is to allow formal documentation of activity observed by Mr. Thomas.\n\n> \n\n> **<Begin Log>**\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Andrew:** I know these past few days have been exhausting for you, so I'll try to keep this brief. What was your involvement in the events of June 11th?\n\n> \n\n> **Thomas:** Day started normal enough, until some Level 4 pulls me off patrol duty, tells me to camp the hall outside Exam Room 3 with a shotgun. Tells me to blast anyone that so much as pokes their head out of the door before he takes off down the hallway. No clue where he ran off to.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Andrew:** Then what happened?\n\n> \n\n> **Thomas:** Heard gunshots and some shouting. Quiet for a while, then more gunshots. I kept note of the times. Few minutes after that, Dr. Jared opened the door, tried to exit the room. The door slammed shut on his arm; I think I heard a //crack//. He had a manila envelope in his hand, threw it into the hallway.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Andrew:** Continue.\n\n> \n\n> **Thomas:** He looked me straight in the eyes, something beyond mortal terror on his face. Begged me [DATA EXPUNGED] and I hesitated... I don't think I'll ever forgive myself for that. Looked like he was doing his damnedest to force that door open. Something must have been holding it closed from the inside. I reckon something was trying to drag him back in.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Andrew:** Why is that?\n\n> \n\n> **Thomas:** After about a minute, it was only his fingers wrapped around the edge of the door, blood dripping from his hand onto the floor. Sounded like something rammed the door trying to force it shut, Dr. Jared screamed in pain, and his fingers were severed between the door and its frame. Whatever it was, though, it didn't want him dead. He was still alive three days later, when we sealed the room up air-tight. Could hear him in there praying, pleading, rambling incoherently... occasionally screaming.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Andrew:** If you'd like to pau -\n\n> \n\n> **Thomas:** No, Doc, I'm fine. The thing that bothered me the most was that the screaming, that was always followed by the smell of burning flesh.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Andrew:** Flesh?\n\n> \n\n> **Thomas:** Human flesh. That smell, once you know it, you can't mistake it for anything else. I was a dumb kid with my first six shooter, picked up a spent casing right after reloading. Didn't make that mistake twice.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Andrew:** That will be all, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n> \n\n> **<End Log>**\n", "references": ["acquisition-log-scp#toc0", "acquisition-log-scp#toc1", "acquisition-log-scp#toc2", "acquisition-log-scp#toc3", "acquisition-log-scp#toc4", "acquisition-log-scp#toc5"], "tags": ["featured", "tale"], "title": "Acquisition Log SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588 - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/acquisition-log-scp", "year": 2011}, "address-to-the-students-and-faculty": {"created_at": "2011-12-06T00:35:00", "creator": "Anaxagoras", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Anaxagoras", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/anaxagoras", "comment": "New story", "date": "2011-12-06T00:35:00"}, {"author": "Anaxagoras", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/anaxagoras", "comment": "Added tags: tale, university.

I've never been much of a fan of Asians, y'know, despite being stuck over here. But everyone knew how beautiful she was. She could walk down a street in a burlap sack, and heads would turn.

After a while, she got used to me being there. Invited me to dinner. We talked, about so many things. Never once did she ask me back up to her place. She was a good girl, a clean girl. So very, very clean.</p>\n<p>Nine months, and that's when she did me the honor. She told me she thought we were finally close enough, that she knew me well enough to trust me. They always trust me, in the end. I've done it so many times\u2026</p>\n<p>So there we were, naked before each other, touching, kissing, caressing, and the things she did to me\u2026 She barely had to touch me, y'know? She could just look at me, and sigh, and it was, orgasmic. But we fucked too. Fucked EVERYWHERE! I came, and came again, and she\u2026 enjoyed herself. In the end, there we were, laying on the bed, and I was ready to do my thing, when she starts moaning on top of me. I'm used to girls moaning, but she just\u2026 it wasn't sexual. It was like what we were doing hurt, but she couldn't stop it. I reached out, and she caught my hands. So strong, I think I still have bruises. Then her entire body tensed, locking me down hard inside her.</p>\n<p>That's when I felt it crawling inside me. However she does what she does, it crawled right down my shaft. Hurt like a bugger, like I was being torn apart from the inside, like what I had wanted to do to her. I screamed. Heaven help me, I screamed like a little girl, and passed out.</p>\n<p>When I woke up, she'd left me a message. Told me I was going to be a father. I can feel them, now, you know. All three of my sweet little babies, crawling around inside a sac in my belly. They're getting so big. Doc says they're healthy, eight limbs and all. Gonna rip their way out of their daddy soon, yes they are. I'm proud to be my little babies' first meal.</p>\n<p>Hey. I won't be around to raise them.

Then her entire body tensed, locking me down hard inside her.\n\n\n\nThat's when I felt it crawling inside me. However she does what she does, it crawled right down my shaft. Hurt like a bugger, like I was being torn apart from the inside, like what I had wanted to do to her.\u00a0\u00a0I screamed. Heaven help me, I screamed like a little girl, and passed out. \n\n\n\nWhen I woke up, she'd left me a message. Told me I was going to be a father. I can feel them, now, you know. All three of my sweet little babies, crawling around inside a sac in my belly. They're getting so big. Doc says they're healthy, eight limbs and all. Gonna rip their way out of their daddy soon, yes they are. I'm proud to be my little babies' first meal.\n\n\n\nHey. I won't be around to raise them. Take care of my girls, would you?\n\n\n\n\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/2011 //SCP-952-Gamma 1, 2, and 3 taken into Foundation custody.

Our parents just muttered \u201cboys\u201d and went about their business, but it was different. It wasn\u2019t sibling rivalry. It wasn\u2019t even rivalry. We just\u2026 didn\u2019t want to be around each other. Ever. We were like the same end of a magnet, always pushing away from each other, always bowing to the invisible force that kept us surely separated. And, in a way, we were happy like that.</p>\n<p>I went into the military; he went to college. I got out and started working with computers; he finished his degree and started designing them. I eventually managed a private companies IT department; he worked at development in a rival company. From my graduation on, I never saw him for more than an hour at most. Since our mother\u2019s funeral\u2014the official cessation of all family gatherings\u2014I hadn\u2019t seen him at all.</p>\n<p>It made his sudden appearance, haggard, carrying a briefcase and a shotgun, that so surprised me. It was early in the morning, and when I opened the door, the light was carrying blinded me. He talked for a few moments at the door, still holding the light aloft, before he turned it off, apologizing. He came in, apologizing for the late hour, and asked for a cup of coffee. I agreed, sitting with him at the table silently. He didn\u2019t speak. I didn\u2019t ask.</p>\n<p>As he was about to leave, he looked at me, tilting his head sideways for a moment. \u201cDo you have any shells for a 20 gauge?\u201d</p>\n<p>I nodded somewhat, fetching them from my study at the end of the hall and handing them to him. He thanked me and left the building. I should have wondered what he\u2019d gotten himself into, what sort of espionage he\u2019d managed, but I didn\u2019t. I just didn\u2019t care.</p>\n<p>The next morning, I found myself unable to think. Everything looked like a gray haze, and even when I tried to concentrate, I couldn\u2019t. I remember turning the knob, and the bullet hitting my chest, but after that, everything starting shifting\u2014going from gray to black.</p>\n<p>And then I died.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/scp-316\">(Solved)</a></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Round 2: Dexanote</strong></p>\n<p>I\u2019ve always had a pretty decent life. I was an only child, growing up in upstate New York with my mother and father. Mom was a real estate agent, Dad was an engineer. They both had emigrated from England before I was born, and we still had family back there. We visited sometimes, in the summers. I never liked English Summers. It would always rain.</p>\n<p>I always got good grades in school, played sports, did my chores, and so on. Never caused any trouble, but never really looked for any. I was a model, if fairly average, teenager.</p>\n<p>When I was 24 I decided to go travel abroad in Europe. Mom and Dad had retired together the year before, and didn\u2019t seem to mind. I wish they had stopped me.</p>\n<p>I went to Italy first, then Austria, Germany, Switzerland, France\u2026 It was wonderful. I slept in hostels and under the stars, I loved this freedom. It was\u2026 beautiful. The countries, the places, the cities, the people, the art. It was all breathtaking.</p>\n<p>One day, a few months into my travels, I called home to see how everyone was doing. I found that my widowed Aunt Helen back in England had passed, and left everything to me, her only nephew. I was told to make my way to Britain and find her lawyers, who would sort everything out in the mean time.</p>\n<p>When I arrived, the lawyers had already sorted out the transfer of ownership and related documentation. I now owned my Aunt\u2019s entire estate.</p>\n<p>I went \u201chome\u201d to my new domain.</p>\n<p>It was June, and the sky was grey. The estate was a large house in the countryside, with a greenhouse and a large garden out back. The entire building was covered in a purplish ivy, and an entire wing of the place contained a collection of strange, curious gadgets - a chessboard, an ugly green statue, a bunch of freakish dolls, a fortune-teller machine, records, phonographs, a wardrobe, a dartboard\u2026 Nothing in the rooms seemed to have any coherent theme. I just shrugged; I\u2019d sort through all the bullshit when I had time.</p>\n<p>I had decided to sleep on a sofa in the living room until I was more comfortable with the house. The huge conservatory window behind me let in a bit of light, the rain <em>plit plit plitting</em> off the panes. It hadn\u2019t stopped raining since I arrived.</p>\n<p>I left one of the lower windows open to let in a nice breeze. At least I wasn\u2019t sweating, I thought. If I was back in New York I\u2019d be quite uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t so bad here. The rain was relaxing, the ivy shivered quietly in the breeze. I guess I could get used to this\u2026</p>\n<p>I felt something brush against my arm. I became very still.</p>\n<p>Something burned. I screamed.</p>\n<p>And then I died.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/scp-749\">(Solved)</a></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Round 3: Ragazzo</strong></p>\n<p>In a Miami apartment's bathroom.</p>\n<p><em>Ahhhhhh\u2026damn\u2026this\u2026this is a really shitty hangover\u2026fuck, man, what did I have last night\u2026I'm here in my god damn apartment throwing up in my fucking apartment while that bastard Jode must be waking up next to some hot piece of a-ah f-fuck\u2026</em> The sounds of vomiting echo off the bile, and blood splattered linoleum of the bathroom floor, interspersed with the odd dry heave here and there. \"Wait\u2026fuckin' hang on\u2026I partied with Jode last week, the fuck\u2026is that my fuckin' hair?! The hell am I sitting in? Shit, fuck, my hands\u2026what happened to my fuckin' hands?!\" And then I passed out.</p>\n<p><strong>Several hours later\u2026</strong></p>\n<p>\"F-fuck\u2026oh\u2026g-god\u2026I feel like\u2026fuckin' shit\u2026what'd I\u2026drink last night\u2026fuck, it must have been that old ass boo-\" A heave, a retching sound. A thin stream of bile dribbles out of my mouth, around the sickly pale orb of flesh that has swollen up from the roof of my mouth.

We've been waiting for this excursion for a while now. Just us and the desert, looking up at the stars, snuggled close. Sophie smiles at me as she finishes packing food into the cooler. I smile back and take our sleeping bags out to the truck. I love her more than she knows. We've been going on random playful excursions for nearly 2 years now, and ever since that day at the camel farm where she came out soaked but laughing I've known she was the one for me.</p>\n<p>I may propose to her soon.</p>\n<p>But not this trip. Watching the Perseids and looking at cacti are the order of the weekend this time. We've got everything packed up now. House is locked up, dogs have food and water, alarm's on. We already made sure things were good with her apartment, so she gives me a quick peck on the cheek and we're on our way.</p>\n<p>Country music blaring from the radio as we head down I-8. I shake my head internally at her for that one, but hey, nobody's perfect. Exit coming up. Heading south now. She's chattering about her plans for a painting of the meteor shower. I love her art. I tend to appreciate the realistic more than the abstract, and her stuff from a distance looks almost like a photograph\u2026at first glance anyway.</p>\n<p>Quick stop in Why for gas and a restroom break, then head down to the campgrounds. Or near enough. Sun's going down and we want to get set up out in the desert rather than the official spots. We go offroad a ways, drive past a hill and park where the truck won't be seen. Hiking time. We grab our packs, bags, and the cooler and head out. A mile or so we deem sufficient. We find a nice clear flat area that's to our liking and set up camp.</p>\n<p>Night now. Smores and hotdogs are sufficient for us. Playful makeouts, with an eye toward the sky. There it is! First meteor of the night. A kiss for every one we see. Soon there's too many for us to keep up, so we just lay in each other's arms and enjoy the show.</p>\n<p>Starting to feel a bit sleepy. Wouldn't be my first time sleeping in the open, and Sophie doesn't seem to mind. My body tingles a bit, then starts to go numb.

Yesterday's paper said there has been a series of strange break-ins but hell if I can remember any details.</p>\n<p>I turn to walk toward the door so I can greet him when suddenly there it is. Soundless, still and black as the devil's heart, its featureless face just inches from mine. The strain is too much and I drop to my knees from the pain. My eyes remain locked on the intruder. The pills on my dresser are far out of reach but all I can hope for is one last smile, even from this fiend. The young man knocks as he finally reaches my door. Thankfully it doesn't react.

The quiet is almost so absolute as to be a distraction.</p>\n<p>Have I found a secret current, hiding somewhere just outside the comfort of a hundred outboards?

The other farmers have been losing some of their stock as well, so I have taken it upon myself to spend more and more time with my flock with a rifle slung over my back. Some of the other villagers think that there's some sort of new predator stalking the savanna but I've not seen any unusual signs or heard any calls.</p>\n<p>Most of the familiar watering holes are drying out, so I moved my flock further out to an older location I knew well when I was a boy. The water there was more often visited by wild animals, perhaps if there truly was some sort of new predator on these plains I thought I would at least be able to spot some sign of it there, but no such luck. There are few tracks and no animals to compete with, and the trees and grass look to be striped with some sort of dark coloration. I feared the water was fouled so I drove my thirsty flock back towards the village when I heard the splashing.</p>\n<p>One of my goats must have over-enthusiastically wandered into the water and was now thrashing about in the mud like it was injured. I dismounted and headed towards the shore but it wasn't a goat at all. It looked like a child, flailing in the shallow water in panic. I rushed over to help the boy out, his skin was coated with thick mud, black with silt. He took my hand and would not let go, and as his face turned to mine I remember thinking that I have never seen anyone so scared.</p>\n<p>And then I died.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/scp-968\">(Solved)</a></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Round 12: Dexanote</strong></p>\n<p><em>Finally</em>, I thought. <em>This place is great\u2026</em> I stepped into the abandoned house, this will do nicely.

What the fuck was going on?</p>\n<p>The memories filtered hazily into my mind. Mary and I, our small transport plane\u2014something had made us crash. I couldn\u2019t remember how it had happened\u2014was it the brewing storm? Mechanical failure? Something else?

The floors and walls were spotless, and the plants were put in place just as they were in bloom. I walked into the bathroom for one last check. I felt like I was the first person to use it. My suit and tie were perfect. I turned on the faucet to wash my hands and was blasted with a shocking spray of cold water. I guess they hadn't gotten the water pressure quite right.

I just can't see it. We go on about our daily lives, day in and day out. But we're just matter, just atoms and energy. What's special about that? What's special about life? It's all predictable, we all follow predetermined courses according to the flow of energy inside us, our free will is an illusion. We'll never escape to the stars anyway, it's a forlorn hope, so one day an asteroid's gonna hit or we'll be hit by a solar flare\u2026or, hell, the sun will supernova at least. And then bam. We're done. Everything was pointless the whole time. I don't see any reason to prolong it. We're just meat and bones and empty inside, and my death will be no loss to the world.

The last time I actually found myself enjoying life was at the carnival back in August. People seemed happy, lovers holding onto each other. Kids running around laughing and playing with their carnival toys, using their imaginations and having fun. Old couples walking around serenely, enjoying each others company. Life seemed special to me. But since then everything has felt so dull. Maybe I enjoyed everything too much and burned myself out, because life just isn't fun anymore. Everything is dreary, I see people's faces as they pass by now and I can tell they're all full of goals and dreams and hopes that might come to pass. But I know better. Hell, they don't even really exist. Do I even exist? I feel that I shouldn't. I don't feel like I belong in this world, that I'm not even supposed to be here anymore. It'd be best for me to just make life better for everyone and end it.</p>\n<p>Yeah, I think that's the best option about now. I'm going up to the roof of this building and jumping off.

I was an only child, growing up in upstate New York with my mother and father. Mom was a real estate agent, Dad was an engineer. They both had emigrated from England before I was born, and we still had family back there. We visited sometimes, in the summers. I never liked English Summers. It would always rain.\n\n\n\nI always got good grades in school, played sports, did my chores, and so on. Never caused any trouble, but never really looked for any. I was a model, if fairly average, teenager.\n\n\n\nWhen I was 24 I decided to go travel abroad in Europe. Mom and Dad had retired together the year before, and didn\u2019t seem to mind. I wish they had stopped me.\n\n\n\nI went to Italy first, then Austria, Germany, Switzerland, France\u2026 It was wonderful. I slept in hostels and under the stars, I loved this freedom. It was\u2026 beautiful. The countries, the places, the cities, the people, the art. It was all breathtaking.\n\n\n\nOne day, a few months into my travels, I called home to see how everyone was doing. I found that my widowed Aunt Helen back in England had passed, and left everything to me, her only nephew. I was told to make my way to Britain and find her lawyers, who would sort everything out in the mean time.\n\n\n\nWhen I arrived, the lawyers had already sorted out the transfer of ownership and related documentation. I now owned my Aunt\u2019s entire estate. \n\n\n\nI went \u201chome\u201d to my new domain. \n\n\n\nIt was June, and the sky was grey. The estate was a large house in the countryside, with a greenhouse and a large garden out back. The entire building was covered in a purplish ivy, and an entire wing of the place contained a collection of strange, curious gadgets - a chessboard, an ugly green statue, a bunch of freakish\u00a0\u00a0dolls, a fortune-teller machine, records, phonographs, a wardrobe, a dartboard\u2026 Nothing in the rooms seemed to have any coherent theme. I just shrugged; I\u2019d sort through all the bullshit when I had time. \n\n\n\nI had decided to sleep on a sofa in the living room until I was more comfortable with the house. The huge conservatory window behind me let in a bit of light, the rain //plit plit plitting// off the panes. It hadn\u2019t stopped raining since I arrived. \n\n\n\nI left one of the lower windows open to let in a nice breeze. At least I wasn\u2019t sweating, I thought. If I was back in New York I\u2019d be quite uncomfortable.\n\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t so bad here. The rain was relaxing, the ivy shivered quietly in the breeze. I guess I could get used to this\u2026\n\n\n\nI felt something brush against my arm. I became very still. \n\n\n\nSomething burned. I screamed.\n\n\n\nAnd then I died.\n\n\n\n[[[SCP-749 |(Solved)]]]\n\n----\n\n\n\n**Round 3: Ragazzo**\n\n\n\nIn a Miami apartment's bathroom.\n\n\n\n//Ahhhhhh...damn...this...this is a really shitty hangover...fuck, man, what did I have last night...I'm here in my god damn apartment throwing up in my fucking apartment while that bastard Jode must be waking up next to some hot piece of a-ah f-fuck...// The sounds of vomiting echo off the bile, and blood splattered linoleum of the bathroom floor, interspersed with the odd dry heave here and there. \"Wait...fuckin' hang on...I partied with Jode last week, the fuck...is that my fuckin' hair?!

We've been waiting for this excursion for a while now. Just us and the desert, looking up at the stars, snuggled close. Sophie smiles at me as she finishes packing food into the cooler. I smile back and take our sleeping bags out to the truck. I love her more than she knows. We've been going on random playful excursions for nearly 2 years now, and ever since that day at the camel farm where she came out soaked but laughing I've known she was the one for me. \n\n\n\nI may propose to her soon. \n\n\n\nBut not this trip. Watching the Perseids and looking at cacti are the order of the weekend this time. We've got everything packed up now. House is locked up, dogs have food and water, alarm's on. We already made sure things were good with her apartment, so she gives me a quick peck on the cheek and we're on our way. \n\n\n\nCountry music blaring from the radio as we head down I-8. I shake my head internally at her for that one, but hey, nobody's perfect. Exit coming up. Heading south now. She's chattering about her plans for a painting of the meteor shower. I love her art. I tend to appreciate the realistic more than the abstract, and her stuff from a distance looks almost like a photograph...at first glance anyway.\n\n\n\nQuick stop in Why for gas and a restroom break, then head down to the campgrounds. Or near enough. Sun's going down and we want to get set up out in the desert rather than the official spots. We go offroad a ways, drive past a hill and park where the truck won't be seen. Hiking time. We grab our packs, bags, and the cooler and head out. A mile or so we deem sufficient. We find a nice clear flat area that's to our liking and set up camp.\n\n\n\nNight now. Smores and hotdogs are sufficient for us. Playful makeouts, with an eye toward the sky. There it is! First meteor of the night. A kiss for every one we see. Soon there's too many for us to keep up, so we just lay in each other's arms and enjoy the show.\n\n\n\nStarting to feel a bit sleepy. Wouldn't be my first time sleeping in the open, and Sophie doesn't seem to mind. My body tingles a bit, then starts to go numb.

We go on about our daily lives, day in and day out. But we're just matter, just atoms and energy. What's special about that? What's special about life? It's all predictable, we all follow predetermined courses according to the flow of energy inside us, our free will is an illusion. We'll never escape to the stars anyway, it's a forlorn hope, so one day an asteroid's gonna hit or we'll be hit by a solar flare...or, hell, the sun will supernova at least. And then bam. We're done. Everything was pointless the whole time. I don't see any reason to prolong it. We're just meat and bones and empty inside, and my death will be no loss to the world. Nobody will even think about it 100 years from now. I'll never be remembered, and the people who might have remembered me are doomed to perish anyway.\n\n\n\nThese thoughts have gone through my head for the last 6 months or so. The last time I actually found myself enjoying life was at the carnival back in August. People seemed happy, lovers holding onto each other. Kids running around laughing and playing with their carnival toys, using their imaginations and having fun. Old couples walking around serenely, enjoying each others company. Life seemed special to me. But since then everything has felt so dull. Maybe I enjoyed everything too much and burned myself out, because life just isn't fun anymore. Everything is dreary, I see people's faces as they pass by now and I can tell they're all full of goals and dreams and hopes that might come to pass. But I know better. Hell, they don't even really exist. Do I even exist? I feel that I shouldn't. I don't feel like I belong in this world, that I'm not even supposed to be here anymore. It'd be best for me to just make life better for everyone and end it.\n\n\n\nYeah, I think that's the best option about now. I'm going up to the roof of this building and jumping off. Maybe it'll be fun to fall. Let's find out. If you find my body, just throw it in the river or something, ok? Leaving now.\n\n\n\nAnd then I died.\n\n\n\n[[[SCP-161|(Solved)]]]\n\n----\n\n\n\n**Round 17: Dr_Adams**\n\n\n\nI swear to God I spend more time writing these reports than anything else around here.\u00a0\u00a0My eyes can't take much more of this damn screen.\u00a0\u00a0I know I signed up for this, I know it's important.\u00a0\u00a0Hell, before I spent every waking moment thinking about it, it was //interesting//.\u00a0\u00a0But how many times do we need to test it?\u00a0\u00a0How many times do we need to crunch the numbers?\u00a0\u00a0At least I have some people to talk to.\u00a0\u00a0Speaking of which, our new researcher was looking good today.\u00a0\u00a0I've never dated a Korean before...\n\n\n\nA sudden crash jolts me out of my seat.\n\n\n\nHow did it happen?\u00a0\u00a0The noise is deafening, drowning out the screams of my friends.\n\nI glance up as my computer screen flashes a bright red warning of an imminent containment breach.\u00a0\u00a0A wave of calm sweeps over me as my training and instincts take over.\n\n\n\nNo!\u00a0\u00a0Not without a fight!\n\n\n\nAnd then I died.\n\n\n\n[[[SCP-176|(Solved)]]]\n\n----\n\n\n\n**Round 18: Tyber**\n\n\n\nDay 3: \n\n\n\nOkay, okay, I can do it this time, I\u2019m sure of it!

The smell of the air, the sound of the waves, the fact that no one else is here, it all comes together to create the perfect euphoric experience. I take a few steps along the coast, kicking things about as I go. I kick a rock ahead of me; it feels heavier than I expect. It lands near a small boulder.

If, on the other hand, you'd like to see the New Administrator get what he has coming to him, then, read on.</strong></p>\n<p>Fifteen minutes was all it had taken. In fifteen minutes, the world had changed, even if no one had noticed. The Administrator looked upon his work, and was proud. His seniors had always disliked his ideas. They all believed that free will was some grand idea. Only the Administrator knew that people were stupid. They needed to be led, to be guided. He was the one to do it now, with all this power at his fingertips.</p>\n<p>All this power. They say absolute power corrupts absolutely.</p>\n<p>Enh. Close enough, for Foundation work. The Administrator grinned beneath his mustache as he set to work, implementing changes that would bring the world into a more ordered state. Little did he know, that his plans were not the only plans out there. The Foundation planned for everything. Even a rogue O5.</p>\n<h1 id=\"toc0\"><span>13</span></h1>\n<p>All of his plans had been built off one assumption, one purposeful lie. The O5 who had recruited him told him there was no O5-13. That the 13th vote was transferred from one O5 to another, which was true. The 13th O5 held no temporal power. While he was often invited to listen in on Overseer council meetings, and many of the council members treasured his advice, he had never been the most\u2026 stable of people.</p>\n<p>You see, the 13th O5 made his home at a site that was not quite a site. While those who had been to it saw nothing unusual about it, Site 67 was on none of the Foundation's official books. It was an SCP, a quite powerful one, and one known as a 'little black box.' No number, just a name. The House. The easiest way to hide something is in plain sight. So, a natural landmark was built around it, and those who had to visit it were given to believe it was just another SCP.</p>\n<p>The 13th was a special man. To survive in the House, one had to be. After all, time inside this SCP was a little unusual. If one were to use popular culture references, one might employ the phrase 'Timey Wimey Ball.' Inside the House, Cause did not often follow effect, and could quite easily loop into each other. So, the 13th had to be different, had to be able to think in more dimensions than the average man. This, of course, resulted in him being, by our standards, not altogether there.</p>\n<p>\"I think you might be starting to bore people. This is a lot of background to get through.\"</p>\n<p>\u2026 Of course, when one spends a lot of time using one's mind to explore all manner of eldritch horror and power, one sometimes gets confused as to whether the room one is in has three walls, or four. So, instead of trying to explain, let's just see what happens.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you,\" the 13th says, to no one specific. Few are those who would enter his office. Site 67 doesn't get many visitors. He is a tall man, red haired, pale skinned, but no freckles. His office walls are lined with book shelves, and even more books somehow stay in place in their shelves on the ceiling.

No one he recognized. But, then, he wouldn't.</p>\n<p>\"Well, agent, I-\" Tim paused, his eyes glazing over. After all, O5-4 wasn't the only one who could plant commands in people's minds. \"By the authority vested in me, whomsoever takes the glasses from his body shall be named O5-12 in his place. Agent Lament, you were never the first choice, but you are still capable of what we need. I hope.\" Tim slumps, his jaw sore. \"I\u2026 what\u2026 did I just make you\u2026?\"</p>\n<p>Lament can't help but smile.

O5-11 had been a good friend, once upon a time. Eleven, or, as he had been known back then, Jings, had been the agent who had trained Clef, when he first joined up. When Jings got promoted, Clef had hoped the old man would change things. They had made plans, had talked things over. They would do great things, with Jings in the place to make things better!</p>\n<p>But nothing had changed. Oh sure, at first, Eleven made things better, eased some restrictions on the Safe humanoids. But he didn't let any of them go, as they'd talked about. He didn't ease up on the D-class deaths. Eventually, he became just another Overseer, grinding down anyone who tried to make things better.</p>\n<p>Mann might not be the best choice to take over, but at least he'd follow his plan.</p>\n<p>Ha! Like Clef would let anyone else take over. The only person in this world you could trust, was yourself. Clef reached over to the body of his dead friend, and slipped off the man's bracelet.</p>\n<p>\"If there were a move past Checkmate, I'd say that. But for now, let's just say I win.\" He slips the bracelet onto his own wrist. \"I always win.\"</p>\n<h1 id=\"toc3\"><span>10</span></h1>\n<p>Some transfers of power were epic. Some were quite interesting. In Ten's case, it was a simple matter of an email marked 'Urgent' showing up in the inbox of one Dr. Moose.

Fuck a doodle.\"</p>\n<h1 id=\"toc4\"><span>9</span></h1>\n<p>O5-9 was the unluckiest O5.</p>\n<p>Dr. Bright glanced down at his cell phone, and made a face. \"Fuck.

Two birds, one stone. \"Joshua!\" He called to his secretary. \"Tell Agent Elroy to meet me at the elevators.\"</p>\n<p>A few minutes later, the doctor and the Agent were riding down the main shaft together. Bright stared determinedly at the numbers as they ticked down, towards the bottom of the site. Yoric, on the other hand, fidgeted, hummed, and otherwise made himself annoying. It was his gift. Finally, he could contain himself no longer. \"Look, Jack, if this is about the cafeteria incident-\"</p>\n<p>\"It's not about that.\"</p>\n<p>\"Ah, then feeding Kane peanut butter, look, it was really funn-\"</p>\n<p>\"Not that either.\"</p>\n<p>\"That girl told me she was 18!\"</p>\n<p>\"\u2026 That excuse never worked for me either. Yoric. You are being let in on a secret several steps above your current security level. So, shut up, and do what I tell you.\"</p>\n<p>The rest of the ride continues in silence. If he had been any other doctor, he might have worried about what he was planning on doing. But Jack had stopped making emotional connections to his fellow workers. He knew it always ended badly.</p>\n<p>The elevator drew to a halt at the bottom of the site\u2026 and then proceeded to move sideways for some time. Yoric shot a questioning look at the Senior Staffer, but chose not to ask. It wasn't until the elevator doors slid back to reveal a sign on another door that he actually spoke. \"Nine Six Three Two? Wait, there's more of you?\"</p>\n<p>Jack opened the door, and stepped inside. The room was small, a large window showing the room beyond, in which a box rested on a pedestal. \"Yoric. This is very important. I need you to go into that room, and open that box, and bring me back the object within.\" He sighed. \"I've been authorized to give you the 006 you've requested if you do so.\"</p>\n<p>Cautious, but optimistic, Agent Yoric Elroy passed into the next room. Dr. Bright locked the door behind him, then turned to the window to watch. 963-2 had always been his dirty little secret. It was his fault it had been created. Yoric carefully opened the box, and, when nothing jumped out at him, carefully reached out a gloved hand to pick up the odd metal symbol inside. \"This the ARGH!\" The agent screamed in horrible pain as his body was grabbed by an invisible force. His bones, his flesh, his entire body was wrenched, this way and that. Bright stood watching, hands clasped behind his back. This was what you got when working with inferior materials. Well. It didn't matter. In a few minutes, Yoric would be completely gone, never to be seen again. And his body would rise as O5-9, the Overseer who thought he could be immortal. Bright would have to bring him up to speed. One of the problems of 963-2: it had only copied the memories up to the point of Nine's first death. It didn't matter.</p>\n<p>After all, O5-9 was the unluckiest O5.</p>\n<h1 id=\"toc5\"><span>8</span></h1>\n<p>Desiree Talleh walked into the O5's apartment as if she owned the place. She had always had a habit of being in the right place, at the right time. And now? She was going to be in the right place, at the right time, to end up an O5.</p>\n<p>Desiree was a young looking girl, of African descent, her hair done up in cornrows, looking at the world through coke bottle glasses. She opened the door to the bathroom, and reached in to turn off the water with an oven mitt. She stared at the remains of Eight with some distaste. Ick. Overseer soup. Still. Miss Talleh reached her hand into the muck, fishing around for the little ring. It was her choice to become Eight, and if anyone wanted to stop her, well, she'd been planning this for a lot longer than they had. She wasn't afraid to call on help from friends in scaly places.</p>\n<p>\"Me and Clef as O5s? What is the Foundation coming to? Next they'll be asking 343 to join.\" And she giggles, at some private joke.</p>\n<h1 id=\"toc6\"><span>7</span></h1>\n<p>Dr. Gerald looked down at the burning wreckage of his vehicle. The flames could easily be seen for miles around, pieces of the car spread across the upper third of the road he'd been driving on. He turned his hand this way and that, studying the ivory chopstick driven through the middle of his hand. \"Huh. Guess this means I'm an Overseer now, huh?\"</p>\n<p>He glanced down, studying the ground far below. \"Now if only I could get out of this tree.\"</p>\n<h1 id=\"toc7\"><span>6</span></h1>\n<p>Black looked at what he had wrought, and the corner of his eye twitched, just a little bit. His mentor, and his partner, both dead by his hand. It shouldn't have been this way. He was supposed to have given his life for Six. Thompson was too good to die like a chump. But this was how it had happened. All he could do was move on.</p>\n<p>The first step was to remove Six's hat and pistols. They weren't special, but they meant something to Black. The pearl handled pistols were tucked into his belt, the hat placed jauntily upon his head. Then, carefully, reverently, Black picked up the cane. \"This will not stand. You shall be avenged.\"</p>\n<h1 id=\"toc8\"><span>5</span></h1>\n<p>\"I feel like goddamn Dorothy,\" Sorts muttered as he pulled the shoes off the body of O5-5. \"Really? Shoes? Who makes an object of authority out of damned shoes?\" He frowned, studying them closer. \"Okay, these really feel kind of wei- HOLY SHIT it's human skin.\"</p>\n<p>He pauses, thinking over his statement. \"That shouldn't actually surprise me. The midgets\u2026 they surprise me. Fuck, I hate these cameos.\"</p>\n<p>As he stalked away to get the shoes re-sized for him, a dozen instances of SCP-5555-J danced about the body of the former Overseer. They sang, in some kind of unison. I'm sure you can guess the song. It starts 'Ding dong.'</p>\n<h1 id=\"toc9\"><span>3</span></h1>\n<p>\"Hey. Josh.\"</p>\n<p>\"Wassup Gnosis?\"</p>\n<p>\"That program crashed.\"</p>\n<p>\"Which one?\"</p>\n<p>\"The one that takes up all that memory on the Cray.\"</p>\n<p>\"Ah, fuck. Oh well, just use the backups and reboot the damn thing.\"</p>\n<p>\"No problem.\"</p>\n<h1 id=\"toc10\"><span>2</span></h1>\n<p>'Ding! You have a new video message.'</p>\n<p>Dr. Sophia Light glanced up from her work with a sigh. If it wasn't one thing, it was another. Sometimes, she missed being a member of the Junior Staff under Bright. No, strike that, that was something she never missed. But she wouldn't mind less paperwork. A break from the work was welcome at this point.</p>\n<p>The video opened on an older, familiar looking woman. \"Sophia. If you're getting this message, not only am I dead, but I never found a way to tell you. I know what you're thinking, and no, I'm not your mother, grandmother or such. I'm you. It's a long story, but let's just say, if you ever need to reboot the universe, make sure you're inside of it first. Your computer is currently getting an update with all of my files. See, you're going to take over for me. You're O5-2. Good luck.\" The video feed cuts off, then turns back on. \"Side note: Why the hell do the time travelers always go after Hitler? He's got to be the luckiest man alive. Look into the possibility of his SCPness.\"</p>\n<p>Light sighed, rubbing her temples. Less work? Never.</p>\n<h1 id=\"toc11\"><span>1</span></h1>\n<p>\"\u2026 and that is why I have decided to pass on my mantle to you,\" the video continued, as Dr. Gears studied the pale trenchcoat in his hands. His face, as always, betrayed no trace of emotion. \"I have done all I can to lead you to this point, where you can control the Foundation. No matter what anyone may try to tell you, your role is first among equals.\" The man speaking betrays no emotion himself, a deadpan delivery that wouldn't change even if he were dying while he recorded the message. Which he likely was. \"And in the end, I just want to say, I'm proud of you.\"</p>\n<p>At that Gears looks up at the screen, freezing the image before it ends. He stared at the man on the screen for several long minutes, letting everything process. He was now the man in charge, the Overseer at the top of the pyramid. He should feel something. Some small bit of\u2026 something. But he'd never admit it.</p>\n<p>He simply nodded at the image on the screen. \"Thank you, Father. Rest in Peace.\"</p>\n<h1 id=\"toc12\"><span>4</span></h1>\n<p>\"Yes, yes\u2026 ha! That would be perfect!\" Mann couldn't help but laugh to himself. So much information, so many things for him to do. \"010! We can expand it! Humanity will do what needs to be done, not what they want to do!\" His fingers flickered across the keyboard, and then stopped as his screen froze. \"Access denied? What kind of crap is-\"</p>\n<p>\"Hey, four, how's it going, man?\" The young teen on the screen smiled. \"Hey, sorry to be the one to tell you this, but the O5 council has held a vote of no confidence, and, welp, you're out!\"</p>\n<p>\"O5 council? THERE IS NO O5 COUNCIL!\" Mann paused, taking a deep breath and standing up. \"Apparently, I didn't erase you as thoroughly as I had planned. That can be easily rect\u2014\" Again, Mann was interrupted, as 11 more video feeds popped up on his screen, each of them filled with the shadowy outline of a human head and shoulders. Each of them displayed the words 'No confidence' in green at the bottom.</p>\n<p>\"No! No! I did this! I planned it all! You cannot do this! I am the Administrator! The power is mine! The power is\u2014\" BANG! Mann, the top half of his head gone, takes two steps, still trying to mouth words. A second gun shot echoes throughout the room, and Mann falls to the floor, his body twitching. His assailant fires twice more, and, finally, the Mann who would be Administrator lies dead. The man who killed him slips into the just vacated seat. Still warm.</p>\n<p>\"Dr. Mann is dead. Took a bit to kill him, looks like the files were right about him doing some self augmentation. I'll have the boys down in research look at him. Is there any pressing business for the council, at this time?\" Negatives from each of the Council members. \"In that case, I, Frederick Heiden\u2026 shit, I mean O5-4, declare this Council Meeting closed.\"</p>\n<p>O5-4 stared down at the corpse of his predecessor. It had been a long day. It was only going to get longer. He took a moment to kick the corpse in the side. \"God dammit, you asshole. This wasn't what I wanted.\"</p>\n<p>And then he turned back to the computer, and to his duties.</p>\n</div></body></html>", "raw_source": "\n\t[[>]]\n\n[[module Rate]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n**Warning: If you enjoyed the way [[[Ecceperago |Ecce Perago]]] ended, then read no further. If you enjoy the thought of a grimdark Foundation, or have a low tolerance for quirkiness, this may not be the story you want to be reading. If, on the other hand, you'd like to see the New Administrator get what he has coming to him, then, read on.**\n\n\n\nFifteen minutes was all it had taken. In fifteen minutes, the world had changed, even if no one had noticed. The Administrator looked upon his work, and was proud. His seniors had always disliked his ideas. They all believed that free will was some grand idea. Only the Administrator knew that people were stupid. They needed to be led, to be guided. He was the one to do it now, with all this power at his fingertips.\n\n\n\nAll this power. They say absolute power corrupts absolutely. \n\n\n\nEnh. Close enough, for Foundation work. The Administrator grinned beneath his mustache as he set to work, implementing changes that would bring the world into a more ordered state. Little did he know, that his plans were not the only plans out there. The Foundation planned for everything. Even a rogue O5.\n\n\n\n+ 13\n\n\n\nAll of his plans had been built off one assumption, one purposeful lie. The O5 who had recruited him told him there was no O5-13. That the 13th vote was transferred from one O5 to another, which was true. The 13th O5 held no temporal power. While he was often invited to listen in on Overseer council meetings, and many of the council members treasured his advice, he had never been the most... stable of people.\n\n\n\nYou see, the 13th O5 made his home at a site that was not quite a site. While those who had been to it saw nothing unusual about it, Site 67 was on none of the Foundation's official books. It was an SCP, a quite powerful one, and one known as a 'little black box.' No number, just a name. The House. The easiest way to hide something is in plain sight. So, a natural landmark was built around it, and those who had to visit it were given to believe it was just another SCP.\n\n\n\nThe 13th was a special man. To survive in the House, one had to be. After all, time inside this SCP was a little unusual. If one were to use popular culture references, one might employ the phrase 'Timey Wimey Ball.' Inside the House, Cause did not often follow effect, and could quite easily loop into each other. So, the 13th had to be different, had to be able to think in more dimensions than the average man. This, of course, resulted in him being, by our standards, not altogether there.\n\n\n\n\"I think you might be starting to bore people. This is a lot of background to get through.\"\n\n\n\n... Of course, when one spends a lot of time using one's mind to explore all manner of eldritch horror and power, one sometimes gets confused as to whether the room one is in has three walls, or four. So, instead of trying to explain, let's just see what happens.\n\n\n\n\"Thank you,\" the 13th says, to no one specific. Few are those who would enter his office. Site 67 doesn't get many visitors. He is a tall man, red haired, pale skinned, but no freckles. His office walls are lined with book shelves, and even more books somehow stay in place in their shelves on the ceiling. A simple old computer sits on his desk, an Apple IIe, still looking pristine and new. He is currently engrossed in the reports of the latest (from his point of view) exploration into his house, when a red light blinks on his screen.\n\n\n\n\"What's all this then? Ah, yes, the Mann takeover,\" he mutters to himself. He happens to mutter to himself a lot. Sometimes, he is even still in the room when he mutters to himself. Sometimes, he mutters back. It helps. \"I thought I still had another week before that happened.\" His fingers fly across the keyboard, reading the reports as they file in. \"Ah, yes, interesting. Full TPK. Well, almost full.

If it wasn't one thing, it was another. Sometimes, she missed being a member of the Junior Staff under Bright. No, strike that, that was something she never missed. But she wouldn't mind less paperwork. A break from the work was welcome at this point.\n\n\n\nThe video opened on an older, familiar looking woman. \"Sophia. If you're getting this message, not only am I dead, but I never found a way to tell you. I know what you're thinking, and no, I'm not your mother, grandmother or such. I'm you. It's a long story, but let's just say, if you ever need to reboot the universe, make sure you're inside of it first. Your computer is currently getting an update with all of my files. See, you're going to take over for me. You're O5-2. Good luck.\" The video feed cuts off, then turns back on. \"Side note: Why the hell do the time travelers always go after Hitler? He's got to be the luckiest man alive. Look into the possibility of his SCPness.\"\n\n\n\nLight sighed, rubbing her temples. Less work? Never.\n\n\n\n+ 1\n\n\n\n\"... and that is why I have decided to pass on my mantle to you,\" the video continued, as Dr. Gears studied the pale trenchcoat in his hands. His face, as always, betrayed no trace of emotion. \"I have done all I can to lead you to this point, where you can control the Foundation. No matter what anyone may try to tell you, your role is first among equals.\" The man speaking betrays no emotion himself, a deadpan delivery that wouldn't change even if he were dying while he recorded the message. Which he likely was. \"And in the end, I just want to say, I'm proud of you.\"\n\n\n\nAt that Gears looks up at the screen, freezing the image before it ends. He stared at the man on the screen for several long minutes, letting everything process. He was now the man in charge, the Overseer at the top of the pyramid. He should feel something. Some small bit of... something. But he'd never admit it.\n\n\n\nHe simply nodded at the image on the screen. \"Thank you, Father. Rest in Peace.\"\n\n\n\n+ 4\n\n\n\n\"Yes, yes... ha! That would be perfect!\" Mann couldn't help but laugh to himself. So much information, so many things for him to do. \"010! We can expand it! Humanity will do what needs to be done, not what they want to do!\" His fingers flickered across the keyboard, and then stopped as his screen froze. \"Access denied? What kind of crap is-\"\n\n\n\n\"Hey, four, how's it going, man?\" The young teen on the screen smiled. \"Hey, sorry to be the one to tell you this, but the O5 council has held a vote of no confidence, and, welp, you're out!\"\n\n\n\n\"O5 council? THERE IS NO O5 COUNCIL!\" Mann paused, taking a deep breath and standing up. \"Apparently, I didn't erase you as thoroughly as I had planned. That can be easily rect--\" Again, Mann was interrupted, as 11 more video feeds popped up on his screen, each of them filled with the shadowy outline of a human head and shoulders. Each of them displayed the words 'No confidence' in green at the bottom.\n\n\n\n\"No! No! I did this! I planned it all! You cannot do this! I am the Administrator! The power is mine! The power is--\" BANG! Mann, the top half of his head gone, takes two steps, still trying to mouth words. A second gun shot echoes throughout the room, and Mann falls to the floor, his body twitching. His assailant fires twice more, and, finally, the Mann who would be Administrator lies dead. The man who killed him slips into the just vacated seat. Still warm.\n\n\n\n\"Dr. Mann is dead. Took a bit to kill him, looks like the files were right about him doing some self augmentation. I'll have the boys down in research look at him. Is there any pressing business for the council, at this time?\" Negatives from each of the Council members. \"In that case, I, Frederick Heiden... shit, I mean O5-4, declare this Council Meeting closed.\"\n\n\n\nO5-4 stared down at the corpse of his predecessor. It had been a long day. It was only going to get longer. He took a moment to kick the corpse in the side. \"God dammit, you asshole. This wasn't what I wanted.\"\n\n\n\nAnd then he turned back to the computer, and to his duties.\n", "references": ["ecceperago"], "tags": ["agent-lament", "agent-yoric", "director-moose", "doctor-bright", "doctor-clef", "doctor-gears", "doctor-gerald", "doctor-heiden", "doctor-light", "doctor-mann", "tale"], "title": "Annon - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/annon", "year": 2011}, "audio-log-185-53": {"created_at": "2011-05-12T03:42:00", "creator": "Salman Corbette", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Salman Corbette", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/salman-corbette", "comment": "", "date": "2011-05-12T03:42:00"}, {"author": "Salman Corbette", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/salman-corbette", "comment": "Added rating module", "date": "2011-05-12T03:44:00"}, {"author": "Robert Sandler", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/robert-sandler", "comment": "Added le links.", "date": "2011-05-12T05:47:00"}, {"author": "Drewbear", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drewbear", "comment": "payed -> paid", "date": "2011-05-12T17:18:00"}, {"author": "Salman Corbette", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/salman-corbette", "comment": "Now how did I miss that timestamp", "date": "2011-05-12T22:45:00"}, {"author": "Quikngruvn", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/quikngruvn", "comment": "Punctuation, fixed a link, added a link, capitalization, typoes, great -> greatly.", "date": "2011-05-12T23:31:00"}, {"author": "Salman Corbette", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/salman-corbette", "comment": "Re-write", "date": "2011-05-25T01:20:00"}, {"author": "Robert Sandler", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/robert-sandler", "comment": "Link fix", "date": "2011-05-25T18:27:00"}, {"author": "Salman Corbette", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/salman-corbette", "comment": "", "date": "2011-06-15T23:59:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

The following transmission was recorded.</p>\n<p><strong>&lt;Commence Log&gt;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> Hello! I'm your commentator, Salman Corbette!</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> And \"Redacted\" Pagan with the fourth annual Anomalympics, hosted this year by the Foundation itself, in conjunction with the Global Occult Coalition: \"Protecting Humanity, whether it likes it or not!\"</p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> Haha, let's not be too harsh on them, Pag. We've also got a few guests from the Chaos Insurgency, Agents \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, participating in a few events.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> We even have a few members of the enigmatic club from Europe, Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd., competing. It's amazing to see the kind of sportsmanship that comes around this time of year, wouldn't you say?</p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> Well, it's always good to just place politics aside and have some nice, friendly competition. Unfortunately, the ORIA agents were not able to make. Some sort of nuclear crisis going on. But, let's get started, shall we?</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> Of course. For our first event, we have the beloved classic 1000 Yard Dash! From the SCP Foundation we have <a href=\"/scp-076\">SCP-076-2</a>, otherwise known as Able, who has chosen this event to show off, in his words, \"What it means to have fun.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> From The Chaos Insurgency Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 will be \"proving superiority\", and apparently Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 from Dark Ltd. will be racing under sponsorship. We also have guest competitor <a href=\"/scp-963\">Dr. Bright</a>, who claims that his monkey legs aren't going to stop him from doing anything.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> And the firing of the <a href=\"/scp-1344-j\">Sun Launcher</a> signals the opening of the competition! Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 of the Chaos Insurgency seems to take an early lead, with Able tripping over his unlaced shoes! He's muttering something in Sumerian, but that's not important right now.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> Wait, hold on, I\u2019ve just gotten word that due to the anomalous nature of several contestants, the event has been changed to the 1000 meter dash. Officials are lengthening the track right now\u2026 And Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is catching up to the Agent. I must say, doesn't he look good with that Bauer sponsored helmet on?</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> Very much so, and it seems as though wearing a helmet has paid off, as Dr. Bright has procured a banana peel from his racing leotard, thrown it across the field, and has caused Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 to trip! I would say that's cheating, but with Able on the field, I guess nothing is!</p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> Oooh, I don't think he's going to recover from that setback. And it looks like Dr. Bright and Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 have caught up to one another, with Able just lagging behind.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> It's a very close race, very close indeed but\u2026 WOW it seems Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 just went topless to stun Dr. Bright! Now, sexual warfare is just a low-blow, but we should have expected that from our friends at the Chaos Insurgency!</p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> And with Dr. Bright sent stumbling, Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 wins the race! But Able doesn't seem to be happy.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> Ah, he'll get over it, it seems <a href=\"/scp-073\">73</a>, Cain, is coming over to help up his brother, and is teaching him how to tie his own shoes. Now that's the kind of thing we want to see here at the Anomalympics.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> Good thing too, or else the Chaos Insurgency might be out for the three-legged race. (Laughs).</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> Ah, those violent days of Able are over, Salman, ever since we convinced him of [static for 23 seconds] he's happy to lend a\u2026 rather competitive hand!</p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> Of course! But now onto a much looked forward to event, wrestling.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> Sadly, Able can't participate in this event because of the incident last year when he broke 72% of Wrench \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 of the Church of the Broken God's body. I would make a joke right now, but the poor guy is still being treated.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> So instead we were able to get <a href=\"/scp-682\">682</a> to participate! Of course, he originally declined the offer, but after [static for approximately 30 seconds] -appy to join in.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> Under current regulations, 682 is forced to remain at 32% of his original size so that other participants can have a chance, but thanks to some convincing on the Foundation's part, he was glad to oblige.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> Well, let's just hope that acid was strong enough. Also participating is Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 of the Chaos Insurgency, Madame \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 of Dark Limited, and <a href=\"/scp-096\">SCP-096</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong>It seems the Madame is dressing up in some sort of suit\u2026 Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 as well, do you have any information on these, Salman?</p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> I'm just getting information that the two were previously professional wrestlers. Sweet Tooth and The Crushnugget, respectively. Thankfully 682 has also been trained in wrestling. If you look now you can see them placing a Luchadore mask on his partially dissolved head.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> What a small world we live in, indeed.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> Of course, we can\u2019t have 096 showing his face, and so he\u2019s wearing <a href=\"/scp-035\">SCP-035</a> with pride, along with <a href=\"/scp-619-j\">SCP-619-J</a>. Apparently we are \u201cpiling on every SCP we can to kill that fucking lizard\u201d.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> So\u2026what happens if that Abomination we\u2019ve built <em>wins</em>?</p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> \u201cWe\u2019ll nuke the fucker\u201d. The fucker being the abomination, I believe.</p>\n<p><strong>\u201dRedacted\u201d Pagan:</strong> That\u2019s an order from Site Command?</p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> That\u2019s an order from the referee, who looks quite scared right now.</p>\n<p><strong>\u201dRedacted\u201d Pagan:</strong> Wish I could get a headset like that.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> Well Pagan, being a Research Assistant <em>does</em> have its benefits. Perhaps one day they\u2019ll promote me and I\u2019ll get an actual chair.</p>\n<p><strong>\u201dRedacted\u201d Pagan:</strong> Well, I\u2019m fine being a [static for 12 seconds] but back to the current subject: This is going to be an interesting, if not blindingly horrifying match! The participants are geared up and ready to go. Who do you have your money set on this match, Corbette?</p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> I'm gonna have to go with 682 myself, since it\u2019s so hard to destroy. (Pause) Apparently 682 prefers to go by the name El Reptilioso in this state, and we'll be referring to him as that for the rest of the event.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> Because of the late entry of 96, the two Foundation entrants will face each other, with Sweet Tooth and Crushnugget in their own match.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> Our first match will be 96 vs. El Reptilioso, who are stepping into the ring now. 96 and/or 35 appears to be shouting about the blood of his forefathers, while El Reptiloso is growling loudly. The referee steps into the ring and the bell is rung.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> And\u2026 I can't believe how fast he did it, but 96 has already gotten 682 into a triangle hold! I guess 35 is really taking advantage of 96\u2019s strength!</p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> Wait? What's this? An audience member has just thrown something onto the stage! Why, it's <a href=\"/scp-572\">SCP-572</a>!</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> A move like that seems pretty risky, \u201cpride goeth before the fall\u201d and all that\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> 682's already picked it up, and is slashing it around with it, trying to find 96.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> And\u2026 mother of <a href=\"/scp-343\">343</a>! 96 lunged onto the scaly bastard's back!</p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> Oof, that's gotta hurt. But it looks like Reptilioso already noticed the abomination and is turning around now, slashing.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> Just what was 35's plan in doing that!? It seems he's already been hit by the blade and\u2026 how the hell are we letting a sword pass in this!?</p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> I don't know, but it's goddamn entertaining. Oh, and 96 falls over.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> El Reptiliso walks toward the\u2026 thing and\u2026 WOW, 96 was playing possum!</p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> He seems to have surprised Reptilioso. And\u2026 Jesus! I don't know how he did it, but he somehow has Reptilioso in a Nelson.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> This is indescribable! Reptilioso has grown arms on the back of his head and\u2026 now has 96 in a german suplex!</p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> 96 and/or 35 is shouting something about his 'destrucisity'. He seems to be stretching down and\u2026 he grabbed the sword from Reptilioso's mouth! Oh, and a straight whack on the head. That's gonna leave a mark.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> And it now appears that Reptilioso just doesn't care anymore! He's grabbed 35 and appears to\u2026 oh no! He just pulled it off! Holy shi- [static is heard for 43 minutes].</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> Give a round of applause, Madame Sweet Tooth is this year's champion in wrestling, and not a single nuke went off! If you missed even a second of the action, you would definitely be surprised at the Madame's performance!</p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> Thank god we all went blind right when that mask was removed! And now onto our next event and a favourite of all, 110-Montauk.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> And it seems a variety of spectators have just lost their lunch, [pause] but no fear, after the horrible events of <a href=\"/scp-231\">SCP-231-7</a> and the [static for 2 minutes 12 seconds] -ven was cured, and the Foundation took her horrible procedure and made it the name of: The Bikini contest!</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> 231-7, however, is now enjoying a picnic lunch with <a href=\"/scp-053\">053</a>, and several spectators.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> Our competitors this year include <a href=\"/scp-105\">105</a>, Sweet Tooth, Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and <a href=\"/scp-347\">The Invisible Woman</a>. Our Own Dr. Bright has graciously volunteered to judge the contest.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> It appears that the bruises from Madame Sweet Tooth of Dark Limited are going to hurt her chances this year!</p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> Not to mention that she appears to have been given several shots of testosterone. In fact, I've just gotten information that Dr. Bright has disqualified her from this competition.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> And there she goes, poor girl\u2026 well, at least she can take solace in the fact she won something\u2026 and WOW, her replacement from Dark Limited is something out of a fantasy book! It appears to be a tall [static for 3 seconds] -ronze skinned [static]wom[static] her entry form states she's MC&amp;DL Curio-BAC-7, and as her letters indicate, she has some BACK.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> Actually, I've just gotten word that Dark Limited had just gotten a hold of <a href=\"/scp-826\">826</a>. Sources say this may be the mystical Aphrodite we are looking at.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> She appears to wear a collar of sorts\u2026the classic MC&amp;D Slave collar and Bright has graciously allowed the collar to stay on due to the events of a likely XK-Scenario from an angry goddess.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> And here comes 105, dressed in a nice one-piece.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> You have to appreciate the modesty of the girl\u2026 though it seems Bright doesn't.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> Right behind 105 is 347. And what a stunner she is in a complimentary bright green bikini. Really leaves a lot to the imagination, as can be seen by the expression of several doctors watching.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> Judging from their looks, it does appear to be the first time most of the attendees have seen 347\u2019s assets.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> Oh, who's that looker there? It's Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, from the Chaos Insurgency, who had previously tripped up Bright with what she's showing off now. And doesn't she look great in that itsy-bitsy thing?</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> However, the showing appears for naught as Bright seems to hold a grudge against for what she did in the first event, giving a very disapproving nod as his only clue to his judgment.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> Just goes to show, you never tick off the judges.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> And here comes that \"Aphrodite\" to strut her proverbial stuff! With a very provocative display, she shows off her V-shaped swimsuit and in a STUNNING moment it appears Dr. Bright has made some comment about his bananas!</p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> (Pause) And the results are in. It's a surprising four-way tie. (Pause) Apparently the winner will be chosen by sexual fav- And they're dragging Dr. Bright offstage.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> Well, it appears no-one wins this event\u2026 (pause) Well, isn't this a surprise? The newest judge is supposedly Dr. Clef! (Pause)</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> Now of course, this is in no way biased, as the judges for these kinds of events are always decided upon whom is hosting it, and as the Foundation is hosting it this year, we have our pick of the judges, we tried to get Nobody, but not even <a href=\"/scp-400-arc\">that box</a> could get a hold of him\u2026 her\u2026 it\u2026 them.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> [static for approximately 3 minutes] -O5-6 is now beating Clef and declaring that there are no winners and this competition was not actually planned.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> Well, what a rousing display that was. Several men, and women, had to leave the audience when Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and BAC-7 started their catfight! But onto our next event\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> Anomalous trivia!</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> Now, as per regulations, AI's and machines are NOT allowed\u2026(pause) It appears that this rule does NOT apply to individuals augmented with technology\u2026 several members of the Chaos Insurgency and Dark LTD.

(Laugh) Up now we have Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 of the Chaos Insurgency and a rather brainy looking representative for Dark Limited up to compete with Dr. Gears.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> And when we say brainy we mean BRAINY, it appears that the contestant has a BULGING brain almost protruding through the skull\u2026 and it just twitched\u2026 I may lose my lunch if I continue looking at it.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> The contestants step up to their places and are each given a large, red button. Janitorial staff are being called in to clean up the spinal fluid dripping behind the Dark Limited representitive.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> Now the first question is: What event occurred that caused the emergence of [static for 20 seconds]?</p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> -ears takes the first point.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> And the second question - in what year did the schism between the Chaos Insurgency and SCP Foundation take place?</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> [static for 12 seconds] \u2026It appears that the Dark Limited representative takes that point!</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> Surprising indeed!</p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> Third question is a Foundation specialty: What are the main components of <a href=\"/scp-173\">173</a>'s metal?

However, as the game is Marco-Water-Polo I can understand why!</p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> Indeed. And the game finishes with <a href=\"/scp-856\">Leopotamus</a> scoring a final goal.

And now onto our final event.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> With the SCP Foundation and Chaos Insurgency tied, and the event being worth an astounding 40 points, whomever wins this will be declared the champion.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> We will now conclude with an old classic, beach volleyball.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> Unlike previous events, the teams will be mixed together, and the winners of that team will face off in a one on one volleyball championship match!</p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> Up now we have two SCP objects, <a href=\"/scp-517\">517</a> and <a href=\"/scp-372\">372</a> vs. Sweet Tooth and Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 of the Chaos Insurgency</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> That's odd, Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 of the Chaos Insurgency is wearing a long coa-(pause) It seems that the Chaos Insurgency has recently gotten hold of <a href=\"/scp-262\">SCP-262</a>, the Coat of Many Arms.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Assistant Corbette:</strong> This will be an interesting match indeed.

At least, I think so.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Redacted\" Pagan:</strong> It's very hard to say with all of these arms on the field\u2026 (pause) And it seems that Bright is trying to call the game off for claiming it an affront to beach volleyball\u2026 citing lack of desirable women.

The following transmission was recorded.\n\n\n\n**<Commence Log>**\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** Hello! I'm your commentator, Salman Corbette!\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** And \"Redacted\" Pagan with the fourth annual Anomalympics, hosted this year by the Foundation itself, in conjunction with the Global Occult Coalition: \"Protecting Humanity, whether it likes it or not!\"\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** Haha, let's not be too harsh on them, Pag. We've also got a few guests from the Chaos Insurgency, Agents \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, participating in a few events.\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** We even have a few members of the enigmatic club from Europe, Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd., competing. It's amazing to see the kind of sportsmanship that comes around this time of year, wouldn't you say?\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** Well, it's always good to just place politics aside and have some nice, friendly competition. Unfortunately, the ORIA agents were not able to make. Some sort of nuclear crisis going on. But, let's get started, shall we?\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** Of course. For our first event, we have the beloved classic 1000 Yard Dash! From the SCP Foundation we have [[[SCP-076|SCP-076-2]]], otherwise known as Able, who has chosen this event to show off, in his words, \"What it means to have fun.\"\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** From The Chaos Insurgency Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 will be \"proving superiority\", and apparently Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 from Dark Ltd. will be racing under sponsorship. We also have guest competitor [[[SCP-963|Dr. Bright]]], who claims that his monkey legs aren't going to stop him from doing anything.\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** And the firing of the [[[SCP-1344-J|Sun Launcher]]] signals the opening of the competition! Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 of the Chaos Insurgency seems to take an early lead, with Able tripping over his unlaced shoes! He's muttering something in Sumerian, but that's not important right now.\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** Wait, hold on, I\u2019ve just gotten word that due to the anomalous nature of several contestants, the event has been changed to the 1000 meter dash. Officials are lengthening the track right now... And Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is catching up to the Agent. I must say, doesn't he look good with that Bauer sponsored helmet on?\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** Very much so, and it seems as though wearing a helmet has paid off, as Dr. Bright has procured a banana peel from his racing leotard, thrown it across the field, and has caused Mr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 to trip! I would say that's cheating, but with Able on the field, I guess nothing is!\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** Oooh, I don't think he's going to recover from that setback. And it looks like Dr. Bright and Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 have caught up to one another, with Able just lagging behind.\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** It's a very close race, very close indeed but\u2026 WOW it seems Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 just went topless to stun Dr. Bright! Now, sexual warfare is just a low-blow, but we should have expected that from our friends at the Chaos Insurgency!\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** And with Dr. Bright sent stumbling, Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 wins the race! But Able doesn't seem to be happy.\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** Ah, he'll get over it, it seems [[[SCP-073|73]]], Cain, is coming over to help up his brother, and is teaching him how to tie his own shoes. Now that's the kind of thing we want to see here at the Anomalympics.\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** Good thing too, or else the Chaos Insurgency might be out for the three-legged race. (Laughs).\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** Ah, those violent days of Able are over, Salman, ever since we convinced him of [static for 23 seconds] he's happy to lend a\u2026 rather competitive hand!\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** Of course! But now onto a much looked forward to event, wrestling.\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** Sadly, Able can't participate in this event because of the incident last year when he broke 72% of Wrench \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 of the Church of the Broken God's body. I would make a joke right now, but the poor guy is still being treated.\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** So instead we were able to get [[[SCP-682|682]]] to participate! Of course, he originally declined the offer, but after [static for approximately 30 seconds] -appy to join in.\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** Under current regulations, 682 is forced to remain at 32% of his original size so that other participants can have a chance, but thanks to some convincing on the Foundation's part, he was glad to oblige.\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** Well, let's just hope that acid was strong enough. Also participating is Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 of the Chaos Insurgency, Madame \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 of Dark Limited, and [[[SCP-096]]].\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:**It seems the Madame is dressing up in some sort of suit\u2026 Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 as well, do you have any information on these, Salman?\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** I'm just getting information that the two were previously professional wrestlers. Sweet Tooth and The Crushnugget, respectively. Thankfully 682 has also been trained in wrestling. If you look now you can see them placing a Luchadore mask on his partially dissolved head.\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** What a small world we live in, indeed.\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** Of course, we can\u2019t have 096 showing his face, and so he\u2019s wearing [[[SCP-035]]] with pride, along with [[[SCP-619-J]]]. Apparently we are \u201cpiling on every SCP we can to kill that fucking lizard\u201d.\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** So...what happens if that Abomination we\u2019ve built //wins//?\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** \u201cWe\u2019ll nuke the fucker\u201d. The fucker being the abomination, I believe.\n\n\n\n**\u201dRedacted\u201d Pagan:** That\u2019s an order from Site Command?\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** That\u2019s an order from the referee, who looks quite scared right now.\n\n\n\n**\u201dRedacted\u201d Pagan:** Wish I could get a headset like that.\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** Well Pagan, being a Research Assistant //does// have its benefits. Perhaps one day they\u2019ll promote me and I\u2019ll get an actual chair.\n\n\n\n**\u201dRedacted\u201d Pagan:** Well, I\u2019m fine being a [static for 12 seconds] but back to the current subject: This is going to be an interesting, if not blindingly horrifying match! The participants are geared up and ready to go. Who do you have your money set on this match, Corbette?\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** I'm gonna have to go with 682 myself, since it\u2019s so hard to destroy. (Pause) Apparently 682 prefers to go by the name El Reptilioso in this state, and we'll be referring to him as that for the rest of the event.\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** Because of the late entry of 96, the two Foundation entrants will face each other, with Sweet Tooth and Crushnugget in their own match.\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** Our first match will be 96 vs. El Reptilioso, who are stepping into the ring now. 96 and/or 35 appears to be shouting about the blood of his forefathers, while El Reptiloso is growling loudly. The referee steps into the ring and the bell is rung.\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** And\u2026 I can't believe how fast he did it, but 96 has already gotten 682 into a triangle hold! I guess 35 is really taking advantage of 96\u2019s strength!\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** Wait? What's this? An audience member has just thrown something onto the stage! Why, it's [[[SCP-572]]]!\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** A move like that seems pretty risky, \u201cpride goeth before the fall\u201d and all that...\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** 682's already picked it up, and is slashing it around with it, trying to find 96.\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** And\u2026 mother of [[[SCP-343|343]]]! 96 lunged onto the scaly bastard's back!\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** Oof, that's gotta hurt. But it looks like Reptilioso already noticed the abomination and is turning around now, slashing.\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** Just what was 35's plan in doing that!? It seems he's already been hit by the blade and\u2026 how the hell are we letting a sword pass in this!?\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** I don't know, but it's goddamn entertaining. Oh, and 96 falls over.\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** El Reptiliso walks toward the... thing and\u2026 WOW, 96 was playing possum!\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** He seems to have surprised Reptilioso. And\u2026 Jesus! I don't know how he did it, but he somehow has Reptilioso in a Nelson.\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** This is indescribable! Reptilioso has grown arms on the back of his head and\u2026 now has 96 in a german suplex!\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** 96 and/or 35 is shouting something about his 'destrucisity'. He seems to be stretching down and\u2026 he grabbed the sword from Reptilioso's mouth! Oh, and a straight whack on the head. That's gonna leave a mark.\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** And it now appears that Reptilioso just doesn't care anymore! He's grabbed 35 and appears to\u2026 oh no! He just pulled it off! Holy shi- [static is heard for 43 minutes].\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** Give a round of applause, Madame Sweet Tooth is this year's champion in wrestling, and not a single nuke went off! If you missed even a second of the action, you would definitely be surprised at the Madame's performance!\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** Thank god we all went blind right when that mask was removed! And now onto our next event and a favourite of all, 110-Montauk.\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** And it seems a variety of spectators have just lost their lunch, [pause] but no fear, after the horrible events of [[[SCP-231|SCP-231-7]]] and the [static for 2 minutes 12 seconds] -ven was cured, and the Foundation took her horrible procedure and made it the name of: The Bikini contest!\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** 231-7, however, is now enjoying a picnic lunch with [[[SCP-053|053]]], and several spectators.\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** Our competitors this year include [[[SCP-105|105]]], Sweet Tooth, Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and [[[SCP-347|The Invisible Woman]]]. Our Own Dr. Bright has graciously volunteered to judge the contest.\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** It appears that the bruises from Madame Sweet Tooth of Dark Limited are going to hurt her chances this year!\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** Not to mention that she appears to have been given several shots of testosterone. In fact, I've just gotten information that Dr. Bright has disqualified her from this competition.\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** And there she goes, poor girl\u2026 well, at least she can take solace in the fact she won something\u2026 and WOW, her replacement from Dark Limited is something out of a fantasy book! It appears to be a tall [static for 3 seconds] -ronze skinned [static]wom[static] her entry form states she's MC&DL Curio-BAC-7, and as her letters indicate, she has some BACK.\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** Actually, I've just gotten word that Dark Limited had just gotten a hold of [[[SCP-826|826]]]. Sources say this may be the mystical Aphrodite we are looking at.\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** She appears to wear a collar of sorts\u2026the classic MC&D Slave collar and Bright has graciously allowed the collar to stay on due to the events of a likely XK-Scenario from an angry goddess.\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** And here comes 105, dressed in a nice one-piece.\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** You have to appreciate the modesty of the girl\u2026 though it seems Bright doesn't.\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** Right behind 105 is 347. And what a stunner she is in a complimentary bright green bikini. Really leaves a lot to the imagination, as can be seen by the expression of several doctors watching.\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** Judging from their looks, it does appear to be the first time most of the attendees have seen 347\u2019s assets.\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** Oh, who's that looker there? It's Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, from the Chaos Insurgency, who had previously tripped up Bright with what she's showing off now. And doesn't she look great in that itsy-bitsy thing?\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** However, the showing appears for naught as Bright seems to hold a grudge against for what she did in the first event, giving a very disapproving nod as his only clue to his judgment.\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** Just goes to show, you never tick off the judges.\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** And here comes that \"Aphrodite\" to strut her proverbial stuff! With a very provocative display, she shows off her V-shaped swimsuit and in a STUNNING moment it appears Dr. Bright has made some comment about his bananas!\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** (Pause) And the results are in. It's a surprising four-way tie. (Pause) Apparently the winner will be chosen by sexual fav- And they're dragging Dr. Bright offstage.\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** Well, it appears no-one wins this event\u2026 (pause) Well, isn't this a surprise? The newest judge is supposedly Dr. Clef! (Pause)\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** Now of course, this is in no way biased, as the judges for these kinds of events are always decided upon whom is hosting it, and as the Foundation is hosting it this year, we have our pick of the judges, we tried to get Nobody, but not even [[[SCP-400-ARC|that box]]] could get a hold of him... her... it... them.\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** [static for approximately 3 minutes] -O5-6 is now beating Clef and declaring that there are no winners and this competition was not actually planned.\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** Well, what a rousing display that was. Several men, and women, had to leave the audience when Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and BAC-7 started their catfight! But onto our next event...\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** Anomalous trivia!\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** Now, as per regulations, AI's and machines are NOT allowed\u2026(pause) It appears that this rule does NOT apply to individuals augmented with technology\u2026 several members of the Chaos Insurgency and Dark LTD. Seem relieved.\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** Of course we have our own robot, Dr. Gears! (Laugh) Up now we have Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 of the Chaos Insurgency and a rather brainy looking representative for Dark Limited up to compete with Dr. Gears.\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** And when we say brainy we mean BRAINY, it appears that the contestant has a BULGING brain almost protruding through the skull\u2026 and it just twitched\u2026 I may lose my lunch if I continue looking at it.\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** The contestants step up to their places and are each given a large, red button. Janitorial staff are being called in to clean up the spinal fluid dripping behind the Dark Limited representitive.\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** Now the first question is: What event occurred that caused the emergence of [static for 20 seconds]?\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** -ears takes the first point.\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** And the second question - in what year did the schism between the Chaos Insurgency and SCP Foundation take place?\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** [static for 12 seconds] \u2026It appears that the Dark Limited representative takes that point!\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** Surprising indeed!\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** Third question is a Foundation specialty: What are the main components of [[[SCP-173|173]]]'s metal? [static for 7 seconds] Dr. Gears wins that one.\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** By correctly guessing it was a trick question and then stating [static] of wh- [static for 12 minutes].\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** And Dr. Gears wins a stunning victory of 20-5-7. Of course, he was almost a shoe-in when the Dark Limited representative's head exploded, and took out Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** The foundation appears to be in the lead, but we have several events lef- [static] -umball blowin- [static] -pture the fla-[static for 17 minutes 42 seconds] and now onto the half-time show!\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** Performing today will be none other than [[[SCP-082|Fernand \u201cThe\u201d Cannibal]]] with back-up singing from [[[SCP-542|Herr Chirurg]]], who will also be playing [[[SCP-298|a very special organ]]].\n\n\n\n**\u201dRedacted\u201d Pagan:** Also, Marilyn Monroe, circa 1961, has been provided to us by our friends from Marshall, Carter, and Dark through use of [[[SCP-826]]] and Mr. Carter\u2019s personal magazine collection.\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** And here\u2019s the first song, Piano Man by Billy Joel. We\u2019ll hook up the audio of the singing to our broadcast now.\n\n\n\n[DATA EXPUNGED ON O5 REQUEST]\n\n\n\n**\u201dRedacted\u201d Pagan:** What an astounding performance, Salman. Not a dry eye in the house... field... whatever! The point is, everyone was deeply moved by the performance of the half-time show!\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** Indeed. [Sound of nose being blown]. And now onto our next eve- [Static for 2 hours and 5 minutes]\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** -and 173 gets another hit. Foundation leads 85 to 79.\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** And I'm greatly astounded by 173's performance. However, as the game is Marco-Water-Polo I can understand why!\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** Indeed. And the game finishes with [[[SCP-856|Leopotamus]]] scoring a final goal. Foundation wins!\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** The Dark Representative put up a great fight, but [static for 13 minutes]-hat a wonderful [static]-ame of tug of war!\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** The Foundation had to take a loss on that one, but with Sweet Tooth the Dark Limited was bound to win. And now onto our final event.\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** With the SCP Foundation and Chaos Insurgency tied, and the event being worth an astounding 40 points, whomever wins this will be declared the champion.\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** We will now conclude with an old classic, beach volleyball.\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** Unlike previous events, the teams will be mixed together, and the winners of that team will face off in a one on one volleyball championship match!\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** Up now we have two SCP objects, [[[SCP-517|517]]] and [[[SCP-372|372]]] vs. Sweet Tooth and Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 of the Chaos Insurgency\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** That's odd, Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 of the Chaos Insurgency is wearing a long coa-(pause) It seems that the Chaos Insurgency has recently gotten hold of [[[SCP-262]]], the Coat of Many Arms.\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** This will be an interesting match indeed. Of course, it wouldn't be possible without Dr. Smith [static for 2 minutes] -omehow was able to get the volleyball's fortune told. Of course now we have two normally hostile SCP objects participating in a fun and engaging sport.\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** The participants have shook hands\u2026which has to be seen to be believed. And the competition has started, Grammie kicking it off with a three-handed cannon!\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** Of course actual Grammie will be sitting on the sidelines, with those nasty hands poking out of a rift that's opened up on the cou- WHAM what a spike!\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** And returned by Lady Sweet Tooth, you have to give the lady credit, Salman, we can safely say that she really is the only human in this competition!\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** And a failed return by Grammie. Point Sweet Tooth. But wait, a sudden serve by 372 and a failed return by Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Bet he didn't see that coming.\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** He really doesn't seem to have training with that Coat\u2026 practice makes perfect.\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** And slam another spike by 372. At least, I think so.\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** It's very hard to say with all of these arms on the field\u2026 (pause) And it seems that Bright is trying to call the game off for claiming it an affront to beach volleyball\u2026 citing lack of desirable women. (pause) And the complaints go on deaf ears as the game goes on!\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** Hah, well Pag, would you say he's talking about Sweet Tooth or Grammie?\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** Well, Salman, I'm guessing that since one of them is an inanimate statue, he's referring to Sweet Tooth\u2026 And it seems those complaints didn't fall on deaf ears as Sweet Tooth just scowled into the audience and MISSED a return.. that is going to seriously hurt her chances!\n\n\n\n**Research Assistant Corbette:** And as the game comes to a close it looks like Grammie and 372 will come out the winners here, making the Foundation this year's Anomalympics winners.\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** \u2026.and Sweet Tooth has made a MAD dash to Bright within the audie-OH that has GOT to hurt, I'm glad that the camera isn't on her right now as I'm sure the Anomalympics would surely get a higher rating for the violence taking place!\n\n\n\n[static] (monkey screams followed by crashes) [static]\n\n\n\n**\"Redacted\" Pagan:** She's torn apart a quarter of the bleachers!

Deletion, you go away forever. Now shut up and let me work.\" He placed the small object on 631's lap, and stood back. Behind him, the guard stumbled over and clutched the stranger's coattails. He glanced backwards, and sighed. \"Oh, fine. You can have your voice back for now.\" He waved his hand, and the guard stopped choking.</p>\n<p>\"What are you doing?\" he whispered, pointing to object on Doctrine's lap. \"What is that thing?

His head started jerking violently from side to side, regardless of the straps that bound his neck in place. Eyes bulged out of their sockets as fingers gripped the arms of their chair. A pool of sweat began to appear on the floor.</p>\n<p>\"Just to give you an idea of how this will work,\" said the man to the guard, \"I advise you look at the clock.\" He waved his hand, and one appeared on the wall.

Small bits of it began to flake away as he thrashed against his bonds, in a manner resembling a seizure. His hands broke free and he reached down to undo his feet, only to find them already gone. Bits of gibberish flew out of his mouth, sounding mostly like a series of numbers too garbled to extract any meaning from. The guard instinctively hid behind the man, and whispered, \"You're killing him.\"</p>\n<p>\"If I was decomming him, I'd be killing him. As it is, I'm only getting rid of him.\" He looked down at the now pale-faced guard. \"He's been through this twice before, you know. The problem is, nobody remembers it.\"</p>\n<p>\"What the hell do you want from me?\" screamed SCP-631 as his torso began to vanish. \"I'll say anything you want, anything at all! Release me! Let me go! Do it to Ju-\" The clock moved forwards a second.</p>\n<p>And then he was gone.</p>\n<p>The man strode over to where the subject and chair had been, and picked up the object. To the guard's eyes, he seemed much less tense now. \"See? Less than a moment. Truth be told, I really wanted to use 055,\" he tossed the object up in the air here, \"as part of a decommissioning. You know, make it part of his person, have him vanish from memory. Thought it would make for a good little story. But nobody would go for it. So I just decided to go for a bit of a personal fantasy while I deleted the page. Makes things a little more interesting on my part, see?\"</p>\n<p>The guard looked flustered for a few moments, and then said, \"Look, I don't know who or what <em>what</em> you are, and quite frankly, I don't care. Just\u2026 just <em>go</em>. I want to get back to my job. Get a new assignment and forget this ever happened. Can you do that?\"</p>\n<p>\"Naturally,\" said the man, turning to leave. \"Of course, you'll be gone in a few seconds, too. I only invented you so I could have someone to talk to during this little fantasy.\" He strode forward for a moment, then paused and turned. \"Would you say I'm a little weird for wanting to do that? Talk to someone while I have a fantasy?\"</p>\n<p>\"Go.\"</p>\n<p>\"Fine.\" The man left, and the room vanished.</p>\n<p>*Taken from mibbit*</p>\n<p>Taximonay: Alright. 631's gone.

The guard instinctively hid behind the man, and whispered, \"You're killing him.\"\n\n\n\n\"If I was decomming him, I'd be killing him. As it is, I'm only getting rid of him.\" He looked down at the now pale-faced guard. \"He's been through this twice before, you know. The problem is, nobody remembers it.\"\n\n\n\n\"What the hell do you want from me?\" screamed SCP-631 as his torso began to vanish. \"I'll say anything you want, anything at all! Release me! Let me go! Do it to Ju-\" The clock moved forwards a second.\n\n\n\nAnd then he was gone.\n\n\n\nThe man strode over to where the subject and chair had been, and picked up the object. To the guard's eyes, he seemed much less tense now. \"See? Less than a moment. Truth be told, I really wanted to use 055,\" he tossed the object up in the air here, \"as part of a decommissioning. You know, make it part of his person, have him vanish from memory. Thought it would make for a good little story. But nobody would go for it. So I just decided to go for a bit of a personal fantasy while I deleted the page. Makes things a little more interesting on my part, see?\"\n\n\n\nThe guard looked flustered for a few moments, and then said, \"Look, I don't know who or what //what// you are, and quite frankly, I don't care. Just... just //go//. I want to get back to my job. Get a new assignment and forget this ever happened. Can you do that?\"\n\n\n\n\"Naturally,\" said the man, turning to leave. \"Of course, you'll be gone in a few seconds, too. I only invented you so I could have someone to talk to during this little fantasy.\" He strode forward for a moment, then paused and turned. \"Would you say I'm a little weird for wanting to do that? Talk to someone while I have a fantasy?\"\n\n\n\n\"Go.\"\n\n\n\n\"Fine.\" The man left, and the room vanished.\n\n\n\n*Taken from mibbit*\n\n\n\nTaximonay: Alright. 631's gone.

I was [pauses] I was, like, floating, and I could hear a voice. It was really strange, when I was dreaming I felt really\u2026 peaceful? Like that.</p>\n<p>Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: What was the voice saying?</p>\n<p>D-3466: I don't remember.</p>\n<p>Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Are you sure?</p>\n<p>D-3466: Uhm\u2026 no- [pauses] yes.</p>\n<p>Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: I think you do remember something, are you scared of it? Is that why you don't want to talk about it?</p>\n<p>D-3466: Maybe\u2026 [pauses] maybe if we went in the room together it'd help me to remember? I like company, it gets lonely in there.</p>\n<p>Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: I'm afraid that's not possible D-3466. But you must remember something if you could talk about it in the testing chamber and not here.</p>\n<p>D-3466: No, no\u2026 you should come with me into the room, it'd help!</p>\n<p>Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Ah, that's our time. Please return to the testing chamber D-3466.</p>\n<p>D-3466: No. No! Come with me! [guards restrain D-3466 and return him to the testing chamber] Fuck! Come!</p>\n<p>Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: D-3466 appears to have become extremely extroverted, and suffers from anxiety when going without contact. He obviously remembers something from his dreams, but is unwilling or unable to elaborate.</p>\n<p><strong>Recording Log \u03a3-5-E11 (END RECORDING)</strong></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>13:00 - Resistance is encountered when reintroduction to testing chamber is attempted, force is used. Subject uses several expletives before returning to reading.</p>\n<p>14:33 - Subject throws the book down, begins scratching at his palms, and complains of skin irritation. Large irregular red patches are visible on Subject's hands.</p>\n<p>15:17 - Symptoms appear to subside. Subject stops scratching his palms and resumes reading. Faint red patches are still visible on the palms and fingertips, and appear to be spreading up the forearm.</p>\n<p>17:30 - Rations given to Subject by research assistant \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Subject expresses intense anxiety when research assistant \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 leaves, and pounds on the door for several minutes.</p>\n<p>17:52 - Subject observed sleeping. Symptoms of intense scratching and bright red patches reappear during the course of the night. The patches have grown across most of Subject's upper torso and face.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 - 24 Hours since initial exposure</strong></p>\n<p>05:28 - Subject begins convulsing from excessive blood loss due to lacerations created through scratching. Upon questioning, night staff were unable to answer as to why they did not intervene sooner. Wounds are covered in gauze, and a blood transfusion and sedative are administered.</p>\n<p>07:30 - Rations are delivered, Subject is still asleep. Wounds not covered by gauze are showing abnormally high healing rates. Scar tissue appears to be coalescing to form several designs resembling SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588.</p>\n<p>08:22 - Sedative wears off, Subject awakes and immediately begins stripping off gauze to reveal fully-healed wounds. Duplicates of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 cover the Subject's hands, arms, upper torso and face. Subject takes ballpoint pen and begins drawing pictures of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588, laying them beneath SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 or pushing them up against the viewing window.</p>\n<p>10:46 - Subject consumes meal intended for breakfast before returning to drawing.</p>\n<p>12:00 - Second interview with Subject.

[D-3466 is forcibly returned to testing chamber]</p>\n<p>Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: D-3466 is showing signs of possible schizophrenia, however a psycho-telepathic ability on part of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 is not above suspicion. Given D-3466's current state of mind and the risk of injury coming to both D-3466 and others, I'm suspending D-3466's access to the interviewing room and barring access to the testing chamber by site personnel.</p>\n<p><strong>Recording Log \u03a3-5-E12 (END RECORDING)</strong></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>13:00 - Subject shows heavy resistance to reintroduction to testing chamber, makes many requests for additional personnel to enter the chamber.</p>\n<p>14:47 - Tissues of the legs and forearms have malformed into larger versions of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588. Tumor-like clumps of detritus (what appears to be skin and hair) have formed on Subject's torso. The ballpoint pen has run out of ink, and from this point onward Subject tears pieces of paper, reorganizing these into illustrations of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588.</p>\n<p>17:30 - Due to the increasingly unpredictable behaviour of subject, research assistant \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 delivers rations through a slot on the lower-half of the chamber entrance. Subject repeatedly pleas for research assistant \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 to enter, who becomes visibly distraught at Subject's actions and leaves the observation room.</p>\n<p>18:11 - Subject consumes rations, and begins crying.</p>\n<p>18:15 - Subject stops crying, and stands still for one minute and twenty-four seconds. Afterwards, Subject retrieves plastic knife from earlier meal.</p>\n<p>18:17 - A makeshift dirk is fashioned from the plastic knife, and Subject repeatedly stabs himself in the chest and waist. Where large lacerations were present from excessive scratching, disembowelment has occurred. Subject shows no expression of pain or loss of lucidity during this experience, despite massive blood loss from wounds. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 orders medical team to refrain from assisting subject given SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588's effects.</p>\n<p>18:19 - Subject gores his eyes into shapes resembling SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588.</p>\n<p>18:21 - Subject vomits a mixture of blood and organ debris before lapsing into unconsciousness. Numerous convulsions are experienced throughout the night. Subject's body shows extreme scar tissue build up and disfiguration.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 - 48 Hours since initial exposure</strong></p>\n<p>03:50 - Subject awakes. Subject's left arm has fused with its torso, and various cysts have developed across most of its appendages. Subject has lost all sexual characteristics.

During its storage in site-46, SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588's emissions have decreased nearly 40% from readings taken during operation \u03a3-5. \n\n**D-Class Profile:** D-3466 has been convicted of two cases of manslaughter, [DATA EXPUNGED]. D-3466 is described as extremely introverted, with a proficiency for programming and mathematics.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n**BEGIN LOG**\n\n\n\n**Day 1 - 0 Hours since initial exposure**\n\n\n\n00:00 - Subject (\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, D-3466) escorted into a large room with a poster depicting SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588. The room is furnished with a bed, table, washroom facilities, ballpoint pen, paper, and a number of books of varying topics.\n\n\n\n00:24 - Subject quickly falls asleep, no effects of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 observed.\n\n\n\n07:30 - Rations are given to Subject by research assistant \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Subject mentions dreams involving SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588, but is unable to elaborate further. Upon requests for research assistant \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 to remain in the chamber, \"to talk\", \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 quickly departs.\n\n\n\n08:27 - After reviewing several of the books within the test chamber, subject begins looking at SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588, and maintains viewing for the next 38 minutes.\n\n\n\n09:05 - Subject mumbles something directed at SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588, and shakes his head. Subject takes one of the books (identified as \"Universe in a Nutshell\" by \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588) and begins reading.\n\n\n\n12:00 - First interview with Subject. Please see recording log \u03a3-5-E11.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show Recording Log \u03a3-5-E11\" hide=\"- Hide Recording log \u03a3-5-E11\"]]\n\n**Recording Log \u03a3-5-E11 (BEGIN RECORDING)**\n\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Earlier today, when you were speaking with my assistant, you mentioned you had dreams involving SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588, can you describe them?\n\n\n\nD-3466: I liked talking with her, you should let her to talk with me more.\n\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Perhaps, if you describe your dreams.\n\n\n\nD-3466: [sighs] It's hard. I was [pauses] I was, like, floating, and I could hear a voice. It was really strange, when I was dreaming I felt really. . . peaceful? Like that.\n\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: What was the voice saying?\n\n\n\nD-3466: I don't remember. \n\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Are you sure?\n\n\n\nD-3466: Uhm. . . no- [pauses] yes. \n\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: I think you do remember something, are you scared of it? Is that why you don't want to talk about it?\n\n\n\nD-3466: Maybe. . . [pauses] maybe if we went in the room together it'd help me to remember? I like company, it gets lonely in there.\n\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: I'm afraid that's not possible D-3466. But you must remember something if you could talk about it in the testing chamber and not here.\n\n\n\nD-3466: No, no. . . you should come with me into the room, it'd help!\n\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Ah, that's our time. Please return to the testing chamber D-3466.\n\n\n\nD-3466: No. No! Come with me! [guards restrain D-3466 and return him to the testing chamber] Fuck! Come!\n\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: D-3466 appears to have become extremely extroverted, and suffers from anxiety when going without contact. He obviously remembers something from his dreams, but is unwilling or unable to elaborate.\n\n\n\n**Recording Log \u03a3-5-E11 (END RECORDING)**\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n13:00 - Resistance is encountered when reintroduction to testing chamber is attempted, force is used. Subject uses several expletives before returning to reading.\n\n\n\n14:33 - Subject throws the book down, begins scratching at his palms, and complains of skin irritation. Large irregular red patches are visible on Subject's hands.\n\n\n\n15:17 - Symptoms appear to subside. Subject stops scratching his palms and resumes reading. Faint red patches are still visible on the palms and fingertips, and appear to be spreading up the forearm.\n\n\n\n17:30 - Rations given to Subject by research assistant \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Subject expresses intense anxiety when research assistant \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 leaves, and pounds on the door for several minutes.\n\n\n\n17:52 - Subject observed sleeping. Symptoms of intense scratching and bright red patches reappear during the course of the night. The patches have grown across most of Subject's upper torso and face.\n\n\n\n**Day 2 - 24 Hours since initial exposure**\n\n\n\n05:28 - Subject begins convulsing from excessive blood loss due to lacerations created through scratching. Upon questioning, night staff were unable to answer as to why they did not intervene sooner. Wounds are covered in gauze, and a blood transfusion and sedative are administered. \n\n\n\n07:30 - Rations are delivered, Subject is still asleep. Wounds not covered by gauze are showing abnormally high healing rates. Scar tissue appears to be coalescing to form several designs resembling SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n\n08:22 - Sedative wears off, Subject awakes and immediately begins stripping off gauze to reveal fully-healed wounds. Duplicates of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 cover the Subject's hands, arms, upper torso and face. Subject takes ballpoint pen and begins drawing pictures of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588, laying them beneath SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 or pushing them up against the viewing window.\n\n\n\n10:46 - Subject consumes meal intended for breakfast before returning to drawing.\n\n\n\n12:00 - Second interview with Subject. Please see recording log \u03a3-5-E12.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show Recording Log \u03a3-5-E12\" hide=\"- Hide Recording log \u03a3-5-E12\"]]\n\n**Recording Log \u03a3-5-E12 (BEGIN RECORDING)**\n\n\n\nD-3466: [scratches his hands and forearm]\n\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: D-3466, as you are aware we had to sedate you earlier today to prevent you from dying from lacerations caused by this incessant scratching, I suggest you stop before we have to sedate you again.\n\n\n\nD-3466: [slows scratching] I had another dream last night.\n\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: What happened?\n\n\n\nD-3466: I'll tell you if you come into the room.\n\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: I've told you already, I can't do that.\n\n\n\nD-3466: You should come in. We- [pauses] I want you to come in. You'll like it.\n\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: We? Who is we?\n\n\n\nD-3466: We are friends. You should come, you'll like it. \n\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: D-3466, if you tell me more I'll come in.\n\n\n\nD-3466: All it wants to do is give you love. [begins scratching violently, bleeds over the interview table]\n\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: Guards, please restrain him. [D-3466 makes aggressive movements] Guards! \n\n\n\nD-3466: [struggles] Come! You'll like it! We only want to give you love! Love! [D-3466 is forcibly returned to testing chamber]\n\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: D-3466 is showing signs of possible schizophrenia, however a psycho-telepathic ability on part of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 is not above suspicion. Given D-3466's current state of mind and the risk of injury coming to both D-3466 and others, I'm suspending D-3466's access to the interviewing room and barring access to the testing chamber by site personnel.\n\n\n\n**Recording Log \u03a3-5-E12 (END RECORDING)**\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n13:00 - Subject shows heavy resistance to reintroduction to testing chamber, makes many requests for additional personnel to enter the chamber.\n\n\n\n14:47 - Tissues of the legs and forearms have malformed into larger versions of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588. Tumor-like clumps of detritus (what appears to be skin and hair) have formed on Subject's torso. The ballpoint pen has run out of ink, and from this point onward Subject tears pieces of paper, reorganizing these into illustrations of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n\n17:30 - Due to the increasingly unpredictable behaviour of subject, research assistant \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 delivers rations through a slot on the lower-half of the chamber entrance. Subject repeatedly pleas for research assistant \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 to enter, who becomes visibly distraught at Subject's actions and leaves the observation room.\n\n\n\n18:11 - Subject consumes rations, and begins crying.\n\n\n\n18:15 - Subject stops crying, and stands still for one minute and twenty-four seconds. Afterwards, Subject retrieves plastic knife from earlier meal.\n\n\n\n18:17 - A makeshift dirk is fashioned from the plastic knife, and Subject repeatedly stabs himself in the chest and waist. Where large lacerations were present from excessive scratching, disembowelment has occurred. Subject shows no expression of pain or loss of lucidity during this experience, despite massive blood loss from wounds. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 orders medical team to refrain from assisting subject given SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588's effects.\n\n\n\n18:19 - Subject gores his eyes into shapes resembling SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\n\n\n18:21 - Subject vomits a mixture of blood and organ debris before lapsing into unconsciousness. Numerous convulsions are experienced throughout the night. Subject's body shows extreme scar tissue build up and disfiguration. \n\n\n\n**Day 3 - 48 Hours since initial exposure**\n\n\n\n03:50 - Subject awakes. Subject's left arm has fused with its torso, and various cysts have developed across most of its appendages. Subject has lost all sexual characteristics. Subject's nose has regressed into the zygomatic bone, and excessive mucus production occurs. \n\n\n\n03:54 - Subject begins \"painting\" the walls with images of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 using a mixture of mucus, blood, vomit, [REDACTED]. This action continues through the morning.\n\n\n\n07:30 - Rations presented and removed, Subject shows no interest in consumption.\n\n\n\n12:00 - Third interview with Subject. Please see recording log \u03a3-5-E13.\n\n//Note: Due to increased volatility in subject, interview was conducted through speakers and microphones implanted in test chamber.//\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show Recording Log \u03a3-5-E13\" hide=\"- Hide Recording log \u03a3-5-E13\"]]\n\n**Recording Log \u03a3-5-E13 (BEGIN RECORDING)**\n\n\n\nD-3466: [paints images of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588]\n\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: D-3466, this is Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. How are you?\n\n\n\nD-3466: [inaudible noises] You should come in, love for you.\n\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: What are you creating?\n\n\n\nD-3466: Eyes for my love. It loves me.\n\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: What is the objective of your \"love\"?\n\n\n\nD-3466: To love others, of course. You can be one of them. You should come into the room. [shows slight agitation]\n\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: How are you not experiencing pain from these deformations?\n\n\n\nD-3466: In place of the pain [pauses] only love. You should come in.\n\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: I'm not coming in.\n\n\n\nD-3466: [grows increasingly agitated, approaches viewing window]\n\n\n\nGuard: Holy fuck what happened to his face?\n\n\n\nD-3466: Come. [vomits repeatedly] Come.\n\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588: I think this interview is over. \n\n\n\nD-3466: It only wants to love you!

Ribs have deformed outwards and expose Subject's heart and lungs. It is unknown how Subject survives while most of its body is openly exposed to airborne disease and natural body fauna and flora.\n\n\n\n14:46 - Movement rendered impossible due to build up of scar tissue and deformation, Subject's spine arches into a curve.\n\n\n\n14:52 - Subject collapses onto the ground. Changes in physiology are visible in real-time, Subject's head fuses to its feet.\n\n\n\n15:56 - Subject's body now resembles an image of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588. Audio after this time record Subject constantly whispering, \"Forever in your sight.'\n\n\n\n23:07 - Subject expires.\n\n\n\n**Experiment Log - SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 (END)**\n\n\n\n**Addendum-\u03a3-5-E1:** Thirteen hours after this experiment a humanoid, opaque entity emerged from SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588. While contained in the same room as SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588, the entity was docile and moved little from where it first appeared. However, after removal from SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588's immediate vicinity the entity proved largely hostile, [DATA EXPUNGED] resulting in three deaths before being subdued through the use of industrial spotlights. It is unknown how the bodies were transferred to SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588's storage area, but it can be assumed they were used to [DATA EXPUNGED].

Walking alongside Highway 62 more than fifty miles out of town, and despite the triple digit heat, she was bundled up in a bright red coat. As he pulled up alongside her, she hardly turned to look at him, her coiffed blonde hair bouncing with each labored step she took.</p>\n<p>Travis rolled down the passenger window on his pickup truck and leaned across the vinyl bench seat, \"Hey there, miss, do you need a lift somewhere? Are you hurt?\"</p>\n<p>She stopped walking, wobbling slightly before she turned to look in the window. Her face was painted like porcelain, with a stark set of cherry red lips and little pink swirls painted on her cheeks like peppermint candies. The rest of her face was hidden under a wide brim straw hat and oversized sunglasses. But despite what must have been an inch of makeup on her cheeks and her heavy clothing, she didn't seem to have a bead of sweat on her. She judged him for a few moments before her face lit up with a bright, wide smile revealing a row of perfectly white Chiclet teeth.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you, sir. A ride to the next town would be very nice.\"</p>\n<p>Travis pushed the pickup door open and she laboriously climbed into the cabin of the truck, one oversized sleeve completely obscuring her arm. She didn't grunt or wheeze a bit, but she seemed weak as a kitten. No surprise really, given how far she must have walked in this heat. Travis stretched out a hand to help pull her up, and she gripped him with a sticky white palm.</p>\n<p>Travis' fingers felt like they were covered with syrup. He worked his fingers together curiously before trying to rub them on his jeans, which only caused his sticky hand to be covered with a layer of dirt and lint.</p>\n<p>\"Are you feeling alright, miss? You must be hot, let me turn up the air for you,\" he offered, leaving a sticky set of prints on the knob as he turned it.</p>\n<p>\"I'm fine, really. It's very kind of you to share your truck with me. Sharing is very important,\" the mysterious woman cooed, removing her hat and glasses. She fanned herself as the air kicked in, looking straight ahead at the road. Travis tried to get another good look at her as he pulled back onto the road, but she didn't turn towards him again.</p>\n<p>\"Well, I think it's important to lend out a helping hand to people who need it,\" Travis said with a smile.</p>\n<p>\"Funny you should say that, dear,\" the woman said mirthlessly, working her coat buttons open with her single exposed hand, the sticky one. Beneath the costume she was wearing some kind of ridiculous lacy candy striper outfit that seemed to be torn and stained brown. A rich maple scent filled the cabin, \"Oh, oh, I'm sorry. I think I might be leaking on your seat.\"</p>\n<p>Travis whirled to look at his passenger, and she turned to face him with blank, unblinking blue jawbreaker eyes. Her puffy red licorice lips pursed into a pout, \"I truly am sorry, sir, I know you are doing me a kind deed by sharing your truck with me but I can't help the syrup. It just doesn't clot like blood does.\"</p>\n<p>The truck swerved back off the road, bumping wildly on the bare earth off the highway. A cloud of dust erupted on both sides, obscuring the windows from outside. The woman yelped and her hair became undone as Travis slammed on the brakes and stared at his passenger in horror.</p>\n<p>\"I must look a mess, I know. It's just that I tried to share with him, but he wanted to take so much. He simply took too much, more than his share, and now I need to get back to the kitchen you see. You don't have to take me all the way there, it would probably be best if you didn't.\"</p>\n<p>The woman had shrugged off the coat completely, and she was as white as her face from head to toe. She worked to pin her hair back up with a peppermint twist with her one good hand, as her other arm ended just before where her wrist should have been. Her flesh was cracked like a piece of hard candy, and two thickly rolled tubes of paper poked out where the bones should be, like the sticks on a half-eaten lollipop. Her outfit had been torn and chewed upon, and there was a large part of her perfectly shaped torso missing.</p>\n<p>\"I'm sorry if I have frightened you, sir, but I really do need to get back on the road. Maybe if you shared with me a little bit more?\" she scooted across the flat bench seat, leaning her face towards Travis as if to kiss him.</p>\n<p>What happened next was a bit of a blur, but Travis was suddenly aware of the dust all around him and the hard ground against his back. His hand hurt terribly from being twisted in his panicked attempt to open the door and flee the cabin before the strange confection woman could touch him. She looked down at him with a hint of regret in her mask-like visage, and thick coils of red vines spilled from the hole in her side down to the floor of the truck cabin as she reached out over him.</p>\n<p>\"It's probably better this way. Thank you for sharing with me. I will repay your favor when I am back from the kitchen, I promise. You are very, <em>very</em> sweet,\" the candy woman grasped the open truck door and pulled it shut, leaving Travis scrambling away on his hands and knees as she started the truck back up again and drove away, stranding him on Highway 62 in triple digit heat.</p>\n<p>Travis slowly pulled himself to his feet and stood in the swirling dust with a stupid look on his face. Had that really just happened? Was he really just carjacked by a half-eaten candy woman?</p>\n<p>Something squirmed against his boot, and he looked down to see a few strands of the candy woman's innards writhing and pulsing on the ground where they had been pinched off by the slamming of the truck door.</p>\n<p>He turned on his heels and ran.</p>\n</div></body></html>", "raw_source": "\n\t[[>]]\n\n[[module

given how far she must have walked in this heat.\u00a0\u00a0Travis stretched out a hand to help pull her up, and she gripped him with a sticky white palm.\n\n\n\nTravis' fingers felt like they were covered with syrup.\u00a0\u00a0He worked his fingers together curiously before trying to rub them on his jeans, which only caused his sticky hand to be covered with a layer of dirt and lint.\n\n\n\n\"Are you feeling alright, miss?\u00a0\u00a0You must be hot, let me turn up the air for you,\" he offered, leaving a sticky set of prints on the knob as he turned it.\n\n\n\n\"I'm fine, really.\u00a0\u00a0It's very kind of you to share your truck with me.\u00a0\u00a0Sharing is very important,\" the mysterious woman cooed, removing her hat and glasses.\u00a0\u00a0She fanned herself as the air kicked in, looking straight ahead at the road.\u00a0\u00a0Travis tried to get another good look at her as he pulled back onto the road, but she didn't turn towards him again.\n\n\n\n\"Well, I think it's important to lend out a helping hand to people who need it,\" Travis said with a smile.\n\n\n\n\"Funny you should say that, dear,\" the woman said mirthlessly, working her coat buttons open with her single exposed hand, the sticky one.\u00a0\u00a0Beneath the costume she was wearing some kind of ridiculous lacy candy striper outfit that seemed to be torn and stained brown.\u00a0\u00a0A rich maple scent filled the cabin, \"Oh, oh, I'm sorry.\u00a0\u00a0I think I might be leaking on your seat.\"\n\n\n\nTravis whirled to look at his passenger, and she turned to face him with blank, unblinking blue jawbreaker eyes.\u00a0\u00a0Her puffy red licorice lips pursed into a pout, \"I truly am sorry, sir, I know you are doing me a kind deed by sharing your truck with me but I can't help the syrup.\u00a0\u00a0It just doesn't clot like blood does.\"\n\n\n\nThe truck swerved back off the road, bumping wildly on the bare earth off the highway.\u00a0\u00a0A cloud of dust erupted on both sides, obscuring the windows from outside.\u00a0\u00a0The woman yelped and her hair became undone as Travis slammed on the brakes and stared at his passenger in horror.\n\n\n\n\"I must look a mess, I know.\u00a0\u00a0It's just that I tried to share with him, but he wanted to take so much.\u00a0\u00a0He simply took too much, more than his share, and now I need to get back to the kitchen you see.\u00a0\u00a0You don't have to take me all the way there, it would probably be best if you didn't.\"\n\n\n\nThe woman had shrugged off the coat completely, and she was as white as her face from head to toe.\u00a0\u00a0She worked to pin her hair back up with a peppermint twist with her one good hand, as her other arm ended just before where her wrist should have been.\u00a0\u00a0Her flesh was cracked like a piece of hard candy, and two thickly rolled tubes of paper poked out where the bones should be, like the sticks on a half-eaten lollipop.\u00a0\u00a0Her outfit had been torn and chewed upon, and there was a large part of her perfectly shaped torso missing.\n\n\n\n\"I'm sorry if I have frightened you, sir, but I really do need to get back on the road.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe if you shared with me a little bit more?\" she scooted across the flat bench seat, leaning her face towards Travis as if to kiss him.\n\n\n\nWhat happened next was a bit of a blur, but Travis was suddenly aware of the dust all around him and the hard ground against his back.\u00a0\u00a0His hand hurt terribly from being twisted in his panicked attempt to open the door and flee the cabin before the strange confection woman could touch him.\u00a0\u00a0She looked down at him with a hint of regret in her mask-like visage, and thick coils of red vines spilled from the hole in her side down to the floor of the truck cabin as she reached out over him.\n\n\n\n\"It's probably better this way.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for sharing with me.\u00a0\u00a0I will repay your favor when I am back from the kitchen, I promise.\u00a0\u00a0You are very, //very// sweet,\" the candy woman grasped the open truck door and pulled it shut, leaving Travis scrambling away on his hands and knees as she started the truck back up again and drove away, stranding him on Highway 62 in triple digit heat.\n\n\n\nTravis slowly pulled himself to his feet and stood in the swirling dust with a stupid look on his face.\u00a0\u00a0Had that really just happened?\u00a0\u00a0Was he really just carjacked by a half-eaten candy woman?\n\n\n\nSomething squirmed against his boot, and he looked down to see a few strands of the candy woman's innards writhing and pulsing on the ground where they had been pinched off by the slamming of the truck door.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nHe turned on his heels and ran.\n", "references": [], "tags": ["tale"],

You were expecting me? How ha-<br/>\nAh. Quite right, I suppose. May I sit? Thank you.\n<p>I can only imagine what you must think of us by now. How many have come to you this month- Five? Seven? Enough, at least, to put you in an\u2026 <em>uncomfortable</em> position. Half of the O5 council, here in your office, sputtering like mad men and contradicting each other on even the most basic of details. But we're very good at contradiction around here, aren't we? I think you would have found your answers on your own if things had gone differently. The research you were doing was damned close to the crux of it. Problem is, you got caught up on a red herring, and it can't have helped that the old man got to you when he did. If you'd kept looking, you would have noticed soon enough: The Factory isn't the only thing that stops making sense if you look at it for too long. Yes, the other organizations as well, but that's only the start.</p>\n<p>Just stop and think about it for a moment. It amazes me how much we get you people to ignore\u2014 do you honestly believe that we keep a dozen drafts of 001 as part of some inane security policy? You've never wondered why so many reports and logs for missions and experiments we've never approved- much less written- just <em>happen</em> to spring up on our servers? How so many hundreds of inconsistencies were introduced to our records? Do you really think we're that inept?</p>\n<p>\u2026you do, don't you. Ohohoho, you <em>do</em>. No wonder you've held your tongue this long, 'just smile and nod and the crazy old men will shut up and leave me to my work'. You disappoint me Doctor. You've come far enough to know that it couldn't be that simple.</p>\n<p>Then allow me to level with you. From the top.</p>\n<p>The things we lock away are wrong, Everett. Fundamentally, unequivocally <em>wrong</em>. They contradict everything we know about math, science, religion, life, thought, they violate <em>reality itself</em>.</p>\n<p>No, of course I'm not talking about the Greens. They're troublesome, but in they end, they are fundamentally human. In some ways that makes them easier to manage than even our safest objects; but you have the right idea. A mortal mind wielding such power is trivial. But what do you suppose happens when it manifests on its own? You've been through enough of the archive by now to know all three answers. AK, BK, CK. The world twists, and in the worst case we don't even know that it's happened.</p>\n<p>Yes Doctor, spontaneous reality shifts. It took decades to determine the cause, but in the end it was laughably simple. On its own, an SCP object merely bends. Gather the right ones together, bend things far enough in the right direction, and sooner or later something breaks. Upon advancing to level 5 we're all trained to notice the signs, when possible. We secure a new item, we transfer an object between sites, and within a day or two we'd know that something was off.</p>\n<p>The implications should be obvious; our very existence is jeopardized by even the simplest of operations. We tried everything we could think of- we limited the number of objects per site, prohibited needless cross-testing, minimized transfers, spread out as much as possible, even authorized decommissions for most of the more trivial anomalies. It wasn't enough. And even if it was, it wouldn't stop Dark, the Hand, the Church, and god knows who else. Hell, we have reason to believe that those damned cultists are doing it on purpose.</p>\n<p>That's why Ten started pushing for a different approach. We can't prevent the problem; why not turn it on its head? We started to look for ways to use the shifts to our advantage. The potential for knowledge alone\u2026 And if we could find the pattern\u2026</p>\n<p>Everett, have we had this conversation before?</p>\n<p>Never mind. In either case, we built Site Zero in the twenties once we had a better handle on how it all worked. I never understood a lick of the physics, but we were assured that it would deflect the effects enough to preserve our memories and our copy of Central Records between shifts. And it did. The advantage it gave us was beyond anything we had imagined. Before the site was completed, we controlled at most fifteen percent of all known SCP objects. We now consistently control at least seventy percent between shifts, and the protocols we enact from Site Zero can recover most of them in a month or less after even the worst events.</p>\n<p>There were problems of course. When any of us leave Site Zero, the re-briefing can take weeks if our timing is bad. But it goes deeper than that. Even those of us that never leave started to notice inconsistencies, internal fragmentation. Database checks began turning up entire unknown files in the shift-safe system, but that was the least of our concerns. It got worse over time, and after a while we started to\u2026 well, I think you've already guessed the rest.</p>\n<p>I'm not so bad off as most of the others yet, but it's only a matter of time. I can't keep it straight in my head. There's no record of half of the senior staff I've worked with. I don't remember any Insurgency, much less a credible threat from Iran. On more days than not, I don't even have my designation right.</p>\n<p>No, of course not. That's the problem; we have the wolf by the ears. We don't have much time left, and we cannot allow our failure to become the Foundation's. Really, though, the solution is quite simple. We need re-</p>\n<p>Very good, Doctor. Perhaps there's hope for you after all.</p>\n<p>I think we're done here. We'll be seeing you. Soon.</p>\n<p>And Everett?

Enough, at least, to put you in an...\u00a0\u00a0//uncomfortable// position. Half of the O5 council, here in your office, sputtering like mad men and contradicting each other on even the most basic of details. But we're very good at contradiction around here, aren't we? I think you would have found your answers on your own if things had gone differently. The research you were doing was damned close to the crux of it. Problem is, you got caught up on a red herring, and it can't have helped that the old man got to you when he did. If you'd kept looking, you would have noticed soon enough: The Factory isn't the only thing that stops making sense if you look at it for too long. Yes, the other organizations as well, but that's only the start. \n\n\n\nJust stop and think about it for a moment. It amazes me how much we get you people to ignore-- do you honestly believe that we keep a dozen drafts of 001 as part of some inane security policy? You've never wondered why so many reports and logs for missions and experiments we've never approved- much less written- just //happen// to spring up on our servers? How so many hundreds of inconsistencies were introduced to our records? Do you really think we're that inept?\n\n\n\n...you do, don't you. Ohohoho, you //do//. No wonder you've held your tongue this long, 'just smile and nod and the crazy old men will shut up and leave me to my work'. You disappoint me Doctor. You've come far enough to know that it couldn't be that simple. \n\n\n\nThen allow me to level with you. From the top. \n\n\n\nThe things we lock away are wrong, Everett. Fundamentally, unequivocally //wrong//. They contradict everything we know about math, science, religion, life, thought, they violate //reality itself//. \n\n\n\nNo, of course I'm not talking about the Greens. They're troublesome, but in they end, they are fundamentally human. In some ways that makes them easier to manage than even our safest objects; but you have the right idea. A mortal mind wielding such power is trivial. But what do you suppose happens when it manifests on its own? You've been through enough of the archive by now to know all three answers. AK, BK, CK. The world twists, and in the worst case we don't even know that it's happened. \n\n\n\nYes Doctor, spontaneous reality shifts. It took decades to determine the cause, but in the end it was laughably simple. On its own, an SCP object merely bends. Gather the right ones together, bend things far enough in the right direction, and sooner or later something breaks. Upon advancing to level 5 we're all trained to notice the signs, when possible. We secure a new item, we transfer an object between sites, and within a day or two we'd know that something was off. \n\n\n\nThe implications should be obvious; our very existence is jeopardized by even the simplest of operations. We tried everything we could think of- we limited the number of objects per site, prohibited needless cross-testing, minimized transfers, spread out as much as possible, even authorized decommissions for most of the more trivial anomalies. It wasn't enough. And even if it was, it wouldn't stop Dark, the Hand, the Church, and god knows who else. Hell, we have reason to believe that those damned cultists are doing it on purpose. \n\n\n\nThat's why Ten started pushing for a different approach. We can't prevent the problem; why not turn it on its head? We started to look for ways to use the shifts to our advantage. The potential for knowledge alone... And if we could find the pattern...\n\n\n\nEverett, have we had this conversation before?\n\n\n\nNever mind. In either case, we built Site Zero in the twenties once we had a better handle on how it all worked. I never understood a lick of the physics, but we were assured that it would deflect the effects enough to preserve our memories and our copy of Central Records between shifts. And it did. The advantage it gave us was beyond anything we had imagined. Before the site was completed, we controlled at most fifteen percent of all known SCP objects. We now consistently control at least seventy percent between shifts, and the protocols we enact from Site Zero can recover most of them in a month or less after even the worst events.\n\n\n\nThere were problems of course. When any of us leave Site Zero, the re-briefing can take weeks if our timing is bad. But it goes deeper than that. Even those of us that never leave started to notice inconsistencies, internal fragmentation. Database checks began turning up entire unknown files in the shift-safe system, but that was the least of our concerns. It got worse over time, and after a while we started to... well, I think you've already guessed the rest. \n\n\n\nI'm not so bad off as most of the others yet, but it's only a matter of time. I can't keep it straight in my head. There's no record of half of the senior staff I've worked with. I don't remember any Insurgency, much less a credible threat from Iran. On more days than not, I don't even have my designation right.\n\n\n\nNo, of course not. That's the problem; we have the wolf by the ears. We don't have much time left, and we cannot allow our failure to become the Foundation's. Really, though, the solution is quite simple. We need re-\n\n\n\nVery good, Doctor. Perhaps there's hope for you after all.\n\n\n\nI think we're done here. We'll be seeing you. Soon.\n\n\n\nAnd Everett?

Smoothing over the \"blue on blue\" incident with the GOC had been no mean task: tension between the two organizations had nearly reached the breaking point, but cooler heads had prevailed, and in the end, both sides had (unofficially, of course) agreed to let the past remain the past. Combined with the results from the latest security test (Excellent in all fields), the situation at Site 19 was possibly the calmest it had been in years. The lack of tension was an odd feeling, but not an unwelcome one.</p>\n<p>There was a low, electronic beep from his computer. Gears sat up straight and clicked on the incoming email. He scanned the contents and nodded. Just as he had expected.</p>\n<p>He left his office and walked to the reception desk, where the new secretary guiltily clicked away from the game of Solitaire she was playing. Gears gave her a reassuring nod, then reached over her shoulder to click on the intercom system. \"Now, hear this,\" he intoned, over the site-wide Public Address system. \"As of 10:48 this morning the O-5 Council has changed the Foundation-Wide Alert Status to Condition Green. I say again, as of 10:48 this morning, the F-W-A-S has been updated to Condition Green.\" He paused and licked his lips. \"Standard protocols for Condition Green are now in effect. That is all.\"</p>\n<p>There was a moment of silence, followed by a youthful, energetic, \"FUCK YES!\" from the computer lab down the hall, followed by a chorus of laughter: not the strained, desperate laughter that usually was heard in these rooms, but loud, joyful, genuine laughs.</p>\n<p>The faintest hint of what could have been the ghost of a smile quirked Dr. Gears' thin, drawn lips, but just for a moment.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Dr. Clef waited for the announcement to end, then nodded to the classroom, closed up his laptop computer, and turned on the lights. \"I'll put the rest of the seminar online for you to see later,\" he said. \"Dismissed.\"</p>\n<p>He left the classroom and walked, swiftly and with purpose, to his office the next wing over. He smiled as he took down the half-empty bottle of Jameson whisky down from the shelf, thought better of it, and went to the wall safe instead. After tapping in a twelve-digit combination of numbers and pushing aside the handgun and ammunition at the front of the safe, he pulled out a red velvet box containing a cut-glass bottle of R\u00e9my Martin. He poured himself a small glass, toasting the world, then paused before taking the first sip.</p>\n<p>It didn't feel right to drink this alone.</p>\n<p>He gathered up the bottle and a couple of snifters, and was just opening the door when he saw a very surprised and rather startled Strelnikov standing in the hallway with a glass bottle in one hand and two tumblers in the other. \"Dmitri. Just the man I was looking for. Come in, sit down. Help me drink this.\"</p>\n<p>\"Only if you help me drink this,\" Dmitri said, holding up his own bottle.</p>\n<p>The two men sat down. Bottles were opened. Glasses were poured. Opinions were exchanged.</p>\n<p>\"Seriously, Dmitri? Horseradish vodka? This shit tastes like rocket fuel.\"</p>\n<p>\"Is a drink for men and soldiers. Not like this swill.\"</p>\n<p>\"This swill happens to be Louis XIII Remy Martin cognac. It goes for over a thousand dollars a bottle, and it's smoother than the silk panties on a high class hooker.\"</p>\n<p>\"Tastes like water. Liquor should burn as it goes down. It should hurt, so you know you're alive.\"</p>\n<p>\"\u2026 are we talking about liquor or women here?\"</p>\n<p>\"There is difference?\"</p>\n<p>\"Maybe not. They're both best when they're ten years old and mixed up with coke.\"</p>\n<p>\"HA! I prefer women like beer! The best ones give good head, eh?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, but unlike women, people LIKE it when their beer is frigid.\" Clef laughed, then began to sing. \"<em>I love my beer! There is no doubt! If beer is flat, you pour it out\u2026</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"Is not true. Flat women has their place too.\"</p>\n<p>\"True. How about\u2026 <em>Oooooh Danny Boooy\u2026 the pipes the pipes are caaalling\u2026</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"Fuck that gay bullshits,\" Strelnikov growled, spilling some of his drink. \"We sing a REAL song!\"</p>\n<p>\"FINE!\" Clef snarled. The middle-aged man cleared his throat, then pulled off his tie and unbuttoned his shirt. Putting one foot up on his desk, rather unsteadily, he struck a rock-star pose, using his computer keyboard as a guitar, then half-sang, half-shouted, \"<em>WEEEEELL, IT'S ONE FOR THE MONEY!</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>TWO FOR THE SHOWS!</em>\" Dmitri shouted back in reply, standing on the chair and miming an air guitar.</p>\n<p>\"<em>THREE TO GET READY AND GO CAT GO!</em>\" they sang in unison. \"<em>But don't you step on my blue suede shoes. You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes!</em>\"</p>\n<p>About an hour later, they'd drunkenly muddled through all the Elvis Presley songs they knew, had tried a little \"99 Luftballoons\" (but failed to remember the German lyrics), and were blearily belting out the Russian National Anthem in loud, drunken voices, when there was a knock on the door.</p>\n<p>\"I'll gets it!\" Clef slurred, and staggered to the doorway, opening it. \"WHAT!?\" he shouted, leaning against the door frame. \"Oh. Hi, Karen.\"</p>\n<p>\"I've been trying to reach you and Dmitri for the past twenty minutes. Why don't you answer your phone?\" Secretary Break asked, irritably.</p>\n<p>\"I tore my phone out of the wall last week,\" Clef admitted. \"What's up?\"</p>\n<p>\"Emergency situation,\" the stern-faced young woman said. \"We've got a crisis in the lunchroom.\"</p>\n<p>All the color drained out of Clef and Dmitri's faces as they realized they'd been getting drunk in the middle of a possible emergency. Within moments, they were racing down the hallway, knocking over houseplants and (at one point) crashing through a cubicle divider in their haste. They burst into the lunchroom with ashen faces and pounding hearts\u2026</p>\n<p>\u2026 to find a party in full swing. There were banners made of printer paper on the walls, saying things like, \"CONGRATULATIONS!\" and \"CONDITION GREEN!\" Along one wall, a vast buffet of various foods and drinks had been set up. A karaoke machine was set up on one end of the room, and Doctor Gerald was using it to belt out a spirited (if painfully off-key) rendition of \"Sweet Child o' Mine\" by Guns N' Roses.</p>\n<p>Everyone paused and stared at the two of them, who had tumbled through the doorway and were sitting on the floor. Clef looked up at the smirking secretary with annoyance in his eyes. \"I thought you said it was a crisis!\"</p>\n<p>\"It was,\" Bright said, knuckle-walking over and putting party hats on their heads. \"You guys weren't here!\"</p>\n<p>Cheers and laughter.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Half an hour later, Clef had forgiven them enough to open up his liquor cabinet for public consumption. Then the party really got started.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"Well,\" Kain said, scratching behind his ear with one hind leg. \"This has to be the best Condition Green party since\u2026 when was the last one we had? Two years ago?\"</p>\n<p>\"One year, ten months, sixteen days,\" Gears said, taking a sip of a sparkling glass of something. He was standing in the corner, watching Dr. Rights corner several other senior staff members to show them pictures of her daughter.</p>\n<p>\"Yeah. That party didn't hold a candle to this one.\" He lapped up a bit more of his mai-tai. \"For one thing, the food is better.\"</p>\n<p>\"Good company is the best spice,\" Gears said, taking another sip of his drink.</p>\n<p>\"That's surprisingly maudlin coming from you,\" Kain pointed out.</p>\n<p>\"It only makes sense,\" Gears replied. \"All pleasure, including the pleasure of eating, is derived from endorphins, and being around friends releases endorphins into the bloodstream.\"</p>\n<p>\"Shoulda known, coming from you,\" Kain laughed.</p>\n<p>\"Of course.\" Gears put down his glass and straightened his tie. \"Now, if you will excuse me, I believe I will be needed soon. It seems a conga line is starting, and when a conga line is in progress, one congas. It only makes sense.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"You know the best thing about having a party when you work at the Foundation? You save lots of money on pizza and drinks.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Around midnight, with the party petering down, a small group of people could be seen standing on the roof of the Foundation containment site.

Smoothing over the \"blue on blue\" incident with the GOC had been no mean task: tension between the two organizations had nearly reached the breaking point, but cooler heads had prevailed, and in the end, both sides had (unofficially, of course) agreed to let the past remain the past. Combined with the results from the latest security test (Excellent in all fields), the situation at Site 19 was possibly the calmest it had been in years. The lack of tension was an odd feeling, but not an unwelcome one.\n\n\n\nThere was a low, electronic beep from his computer. Gears sat up straight and clicked on the incoming email. He scanned the contents and nodded. Just as he had expected.\n\n\n\nHe left his office and walked to the reception desk, where the new secretary guiltily clicked away from the game of Solitaire she was playing. Gears gave her a reassuring nod, then reached over her shoulder to click on the intercom system. \"Now, hear this,\" he intoned, over the site-wide Public Address system. \"As of 10:48 this morning the O-5 Council has changed the Foundation-Wide Alert Status to Condition Green. I say again, as of 10:48 this morning, the F-W-A-S has been updated to Condition Green.\" He paused and licked his lips. \"Standard protocols for Condition Green are now in effect. That is all.\"\n\n\n\nThere was a moment of silence, followed by a youthful, energetic, \"FUCK YES!\" from the computer lab down the hall, followed by a chorus of laughter: not the strained, desperate laughter that usually was heard in these rooms, but loud, joyful, genuine laughs.\n\n\n\nThe faintest hint of what could have been the ghost of a smile quirked Dr. Gears' thin, drawn lips, but just for a moment.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nDr. Clef waited for the announcement to end, then nodded to the classroom, closed up his laptop computer, and turned on the lights. \"I'll put the rest of the seminar online for you to see later,\" he said. \"Dismissed.\"\n\n\n\nHe left the classroom and walked, swiftly and with purpose, to his office the next wing over. He smiled as he took down the half-empty bottle of Jameson whisky down from the shelf, thought better of it, and went to the wall safe instead. After tapping in a twelve-digit combination of numbers and pushing aside the handgun and ammunition at the front of the safe, he pulled out a red velvet box containing a cut-glass bottle of R\u00e9my Martin. He poured himself a small glass, toasting the world, then paused before taking the first sip.\n\n\n\nIt didn't feel right to drink this alone.\n\n\n\nHe gathered up the bottle and a couple of snifters, and was just opening the door when he saw a very surprised and rather startled Strelnikov standing in the hallway with a glass bottle in one hand and two tumblers in the other. \"Dmitri. Just the man I was looking for. Come in, sit down. Help me drink this.\"\n\n\n\n\"Only if you help me drink this,\" Dmitri said, holding up his own bottle.\n\n\n\nThe two men sat down. Bottles were opened. Glasses were poured. Opinions were exchanged.\n\n\n\n\"Seriously, Dmitri? Horseradish vodka? This shit tastes like rocket fuel.\"\n\n\n\n\"Is a drink for men and soldiers. Not like this swill.\"\n\n\n\n\"This swill happens to be Louis XIII Remy Martin cognac. It goes for over a thousand dollars a bottle, and it's smoother than the silk panties on a high class hooker.\"\n\n\n\n\"Tastes like water. Liquor should burn as it goes down. It should hurt, so you know you're alive.\"\n\n\n\n\". . . are we talking about liquor or women here?\"\n\n\n\n\"There is difference?\"\n\n\n\n\"Maybe not. They're both best when they're ten years old and mixed up with coke.\"\n\n\n\n\"HA! I prefer women like beer! The best ones give good head, eh?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, but unlike women, people LIKE it when their beer is frigid.\" Clef laughed, then began to sing. \"//I love my beer! There is no doubt! If beer is flat, you pour it out. . .//\" \n\n\n\n\"Is not true. Flat women has their place too.\"\n\n\n\n\"True. How about. . . //Oooooh Danny Boooy. . . the pipes the pipes are caaalling. . .//\"\n\n\n\n\"Fuck that gay bullshits,\" Strelnikov growled, spilling some of his drink. \"We sing a REAL song!\"\n\n\n\n\"FINE!\" Clef snarled. The middle-aged man cleared his throat, then pulled off his tie and unbuttoned his shirt. Putting one foot up on his desk, rather unsteadily, he struck a rock-star pose, using his computer keyboard as a guitar, then half-sang, half-shouted, \"//WEEEEELL, IT'S ONE FOR THE MONEY!//\"\n\n\n\n\"//TWO FOR THE SHOWS!//\" Dmitri shouted back in reply, standing on the chair and miming an air guitar.\n\n\n\n\"//THREE TO GET READY AND GO CAT GO!//\" they sang in unison. \"//But don't you step on my blue suede shoes. You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes!//\"\n\n\n\nAbout an hour later, they'd drunkenly muddled through all the Elvis Presley songs they knew, had tried a little \"99 Luftballoons\" (but failed to remember the German lyrics), and were blearily belting out the Russian National Anthem in loud, drunken voices, when there was a knock on the door.\n\n\n\n\"I'll gets it!\" Clef slurred, and staggered to the doorway, opening it. \"WHAT!?\" he shouted, leaning against the door frame. \"Oh. Hi, Karen.\"\n\n\n\n\"I've been trying to reach you and Dmitri for the past twenty minutes. Why don't you answer your phone?\" Secretary Break asked, irritably.\n\n\n\n\"I tore my phone out of the wall last week,\" Clef admitted. \"What's up?\"\n\n\n\n\"Emergency situation,\" the stern-faced young woman said. \"We've got a crisis in the lunchroom.\"\n\n\n\nAll the color drained out of Clef and Dmitri's faces as they realized they'd been getting drunk in the middle of a possible emergency. Within moments, they were racing down the hallway, knocking over houseplants and (at one point) crashing through a cubicle divider in their haste. They burst into the lunchroom with ashen faces and pounding hearts. . .\n\n\n\n. . . to find a party in full swing. There were banners made of printer paper on the walls, saying things like, \"CONGRATULATIONS!\" and \"CONDITION GREEN!\" Along one wall, a vast buffet of various foods and drinks had been set up. A karaoke machine was set up on one end of the room, and Doctor Gerald was using it to belt out a spirited (if painfully off-key) rendition of \"Sweet Child o' Mine\" by Guns N' Roses. \n\n\n\nEveryone paused and stared at the two of them, who had tumbled through the doorway and were sitting on the floor. Clef looked up at the smirking secretary with annoyance in his eyes. \"I thought you said it was a crisis!\"\n\n\n\n\"It was,\" Bright said, knuckle-walking over and putting party hats on their heads. \"You guys weren't here!\"\n\n\n\nCheers and laughter.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nHalf an hour later, Clef had forgiven them enough to open up his liquor cabinet for public consumption. Then the party really got started.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n\"Well,\" Kain said, scratching behind his ear with one hind leg. \"This has to be the best Condition Green party since. . . when was the last one we had? Two years ago?\"\n\n\n\n\"One year, ten months, sixteen days,\" Gears said, taking a sip of a sparkling glass of something. He was standing in the corner, watching Dr. Rights corner several other senior staff members to show them pictures of her daughter.\n\n\n\n\"Yeah. That party didn't hold a candle to this one.\" He lapped up a bit more of his mai-tai. \"For one thing, the food is better.\"\n\n\n\n\"Good company is the best spice,\" Gears said, taking another sip of his drink.\n\n\n\n\"That's surprisingly maudlin coming from you,\" Kain pointed out.\n\n\n\n\"It only makes sense,\" Gears replied. \"All pleasure, including the pleasure of eating, is derived from endorphins, and being around friends releases endorphins into the bloodstream.\" \n\n\n\n\"Shoulda known, coming from you,\" Kain laughed.\n\n\n\n\"Of course.\" Gears put down his glass and straightened his tie. \"Now, if you will excuse me, I believe I will be needed soon. It seems a conga line is starting, and when a conga line is in progress, one congas. It only makes sense.\"\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n\"You know the best thing about having a party when you work at the Foundation? You save lots of money on pizza and drinks.\"\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nAround midnight, with the party petering down, a small group of people could be seen standing on the roof of the Foundation containment site. All of them were high-level site personnel. All of them were holding glasses of champagne.\n\n\n\n\"In the end,\" Dr. Mann said, \"All of us will face judgement. When that day comes. . . may I be judged by the quality of my friends.\"\n\n\n\n\"Hear hear,\" Light replied.\n\n\n\nWith a low murmur of agreement, all of them drank.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nIn an undisclosed location far away, a man and a woman sat on the balcony of an apartment building, staring up at the wide, full moon. The remnants of a bottle of fine port, and a wedge of Stilton cheese and some crackers, sat on the patio table between them.\n\n\n\nThere was a soft, electronic ping, and the cell phone on the patio table vibrated gently. The man reached out and flipped it open. \"Hello,\" he said softly.\n\n\n\nHe listened for a while, then pursed his lips. \"How urgent is it?\" The man listened a while longer, then nodded. \"Then let's live and let live. It will still be there in the morning. Maintain Condition Green for another eight hours, then dispatch a notice to Site 19, Priority Yellow.

A dull \"boom, boom\" in the distance that echoed over the landscape. She was half-asleep when it happened, before her phone rang.

Nope, just really goddamn early. And who the fuck was shooting off fireworks? The dull booming was constant, now, and she struggled to get up and pull on sweatpants, making her way downstairs. The TV was on, her husband before it, and she went to put a hand on his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\"Christopher, hey.\" She squeezed his shoulder. He didn't look up from the TV. She glanced at it, and froze, instantly awake. It was the local news channel, video of brilliant white fireworks in the sky. The camera panned down, to where the reporter, in a panic, was gesturing and shouting to a perfectly whitewashed sculpture of a human being, frozen in mid-run. It could have been a statue, were it not for the impossible detail. And the many other white-coated items in view. A house, cars, a bird in mid-flight.</p>\n<p>She hauled Christopher to his feet, snapping him out of his stupor. \"Get the kids!\" She barked, in his face, and he stared at her.</p>\n<p>\"We\u2026.we should stay inside.\"</p>\n<p>\"Nope!\" She released him, and motioned to the kids' rooms, turning to the door. She had to get the car started, dashing upstairs to grab her phone and keys, returning downstairs just as the cries of an interrupted toddler started to go through the house. Christopher stepped out, carrying the little boy, and she nodded to him, hustling to the garage. She waited in the car, checking her phone again. Low signal. Finally, he stepped into the garage, carting the still-bawling toddler and a frightened five-year-old girl behind him.</p>\n<p>\"Ophelia, you get in the front seat. You're riding like a big girl for this!\" She shouted out the window, and the girl perked up, a bit, hurrying around. \"Christopher, get in the back. You can put Chester in while we're moving.\" He nodded, and did so, frowning at his wife.</p>\n<p>\"\u2026I promise, I'll explain later,\" she said, softly, making sure Ophelia was buckled in and Christopher was getting the boy into his carseat before pulling out of the garage. Outside, the neighborhood was a mixture of panic and reserve. Most people were hiding inside. Some, though\u2026were out, sitting on rooftops, standing in yards, frantically packing cars.</p>\n<p>The second she heard Chester's restraint belt click into place, she floored it, steering the family van wildly around people and cars alike in the street. They came across a massive white splatter on the street, and she curved around it. Out of the neighborhood, out of the suburbs\u2026into the surrounding fields.</p>\n<p>The little boy fell back asleep. Christopher and Ophelia stared out the windows, uncertain and horrified. There were white items everywhere, splatters over cornfields, perfectly preserved white trees. A few people, here and there, cars, stopped in the street, the people inside frozen perfectly.</p>\n<p>Rights tried not to look, until she barreled through the gates of the compound, slowing only to roll down the window so the guard could see her. He waved her through, and she pulled into the parking lot, where several others were waiting, being led in. There weren't that many, actually, when she looked over it. Only a dozen or so, but there were several white splatters on the asphalt, a handful of white cars\u2026</p>\n<p>She skidded to a stop. \"Get the kids out!\" She shouted at Christopher, hopping out and looking around, finding herself face to face with Gears. He looked at her impassively, and checked her name off of a list. \"What the fuck is going on?!\"</p>\n<p>\"We believe SCP-7843-1 either breached containment, or was released by a hostile group.\"</p>\n<p>Dr. Rights gestured emphatically in the arm, trying to work up words, though now her lack of sleep and preparation were catching up to her. Christopher called from behind her.</p>\n<p>\"Honey!\"</p>\n<p>\"One moment!\" She shouted back. He must've been struggling with the child restraint, still. Ophelia opened the car door and sat there, legs swinging, looking around uncomfortably. Rights glanced at them, then back to Gears, wincing as several of the booming sounds grew louder, then faded again. She looked up, the white fireworks were starting to leave cracks in the sky, she could see them in the distance. Like cracks on a windshield, centered and spreading.</p>\n<p>\"Please make your way inside, to the designated shelter areas,\" Gears said. Rights glared at him.</p>\n<p>\"What are we doing?\"</p>\n<p>\"I am not certain what you mean by this question.\"</p>\n<p>\"This is nationwide, isn't it? Worldwide? What the <em>god damn hell</em> are we doing about this?!\"</p>\n<p>\"Mom! Mom!\" Ophelia shouted, upset.</p>\n<p>\"\u2026There will be a controlled release of SCP-7778 into the upper atmosphere, once the satellites reach optimum height.\" She stared. \"This will occur in thirty-seven minutes, approximately. Please retrieve your family and-\"</p>\n<p>BOOM</p>\n<p>BOOM</p>\n<p>BOOM</p>\n<p>He didn't finish his sentence, and she almost didn't see him react, so focused she was on his impassive, unmoving face, when his hand fisted in her shirt, and dragged her forwards, roughly. She hit the ground at his feet, hard, and cursed, tensing as she saw white splatter here and there, meters away but still too close. A scream was cut off, and she saw one of the splatters hit another researcher, and in a moment he was nothing, a blank white statue of himself, in mid-stride, his coat billowing behind him.</p>\n<p>Gears looked behind her.</p>\n<p>She didn't hear anything.</p>\n<p>She got to her feet slowly, taking in a very, very deep breath.</p>\n<p>\"Doctor Rights, please go indoors.\"</p>\n<p>\"\u2026\" She stared at him. The remaining few in the parking lot were bolting their way inside.</p>\n<p>\"\u2026Please go indoors, to the designated shelter area. Do not turn around.\"</p>\n<p>She didn't listen, and turned on her heel. The white had hit the van head-on, and it, and the short area surrounding it, were completely washed. Inside the open doors, she could see Christopher, hunched over Chester's peacefully sleeping face, his hands locked in mid-struggle with a twisted belt. Ophelia's mouth was open, mid-yell, brows low and fingers gripping the edge of her seat with concern.</p>\n<p>Every last detail of them, down to their eyelashes, perfectly preserved, and washed white.</p>\n<p>She was not entirely certain what happened next, other than that it was exceedingly rough, and she knew bruises were going to form on her arm where he grabbed her and hauled her inside, ignoring her kicks and screams. It wasn't until she was flung onto a couch that her thoughts seemed to catch up to her, and she decided to stop screaming and fighting and start curling up and crying. Going through the emotional training was not anything like the real thing, she thought in the back of her mind.</p>\n<p>A quarter-hour passed, and she felt good enough to sit up and look around. One of the lower lounges, re-purposed. The doors were shut, and there were a few dozen individuals waiting around.</p>\n<p>\"\u2026Where is everybody?\"</p>\n<p>\"There are nineteen designated safety areas for staff in Site 17.\" Gears was sitting next to her, looking over a checklist. She stole a glance and rubbed her bleary eyes. Names. Very few of them were checked off.</p>\n<p>\"What about the skips?\"</p>\n<p>\"SCP Containment is self-sealed under Emergency Protocols. They should remain unaffected, as us.\"</p>\n<p>She sat back against the couch, going over every question in her mind, trying to pick the important ones.</p>\n<p>\"\u2026When is the reset set for?\"</p>\n<p>\"The first instance of SCP-7843-1 was detected at Midnight, Central Time. The reset is set to return to one minute before the first detonation occurred, and the phenomenon became self-propagating.\"</p>\n<p>She forgot her questions, and another jag of crying hit her. A few of the other researchers looked at her with mixtures of pity and empathy. She caught her breath, and Gears handed her a pen.</p>\n<p>\"\u2026What's this for?\"</p>\n<p>\"Do you remember the report you submitted while applying for your current position? It was about the possibility for physical evidence to remain after preternaturally memetic or reality-altering events.\" She stared at him, blankly, as he stood and pulled more pens from his pocket, handing them out around the room. \"We are presented with a unique opportunity here, to retain information of an information-erasure event. While the Foundation already has pre-set means to record these hours, this will serve as a baseline test for the possibility of personal information retention.\"</p>\n<p>Everybody else seemed to get it at once, with a collective series of \"oh\"s and \"ah\"s and \"this is retarded\"s.</p>\n<p>Rights looked down at her hands.</p>\n<p>\"There are four to five minutes remaining until SCP-7778's release. Please take this opportunity to manufacture evidence.\" Gears announced, and sat back down, all out of pens, looking over his sheet again.</p>\n<p>Rights stared at her bare arms, still in her pajama top. She looked up. One researcher was frantically scrawling on the walls, another was opening magazines and writing inside of them, on every page, methodically and quick. One of them started writing on the inside of his labcoat. She looked at her arms again\u2026and began to write.</p>\n<p>Over the next several minutes, many things happened. Most importantly, though, the walls began to fade. They could be seen through, and before long they could see all the way to other saferooms. There was some waving and gesturing back and forth. She looked down, between her feet, and saw SCPs peering back up at her. The furniture went next. Some items were retaining, but many things, including the edge of Rights' slippers, were started to fade as well.</p>\n<p>She kept writing, they all did. There was little else to do. Dr. Gears' list disappeared out of his hands, and he sat there, eyes closed, arms at his side like a puppet with no strings. Finally, Rights ran out of important things to write. She had started at the elbow of her left arm, and extended down to the back of her hand, with her tiny, neat handwriting. Names, dates, appearances\u2026</p>\n<p>\"Hey, Gears?,\" Rights asked, looking down at her feet. Her ankles faded, revealing yellow fat and red muscle beneath. Her toes, just rapidly-fading bones, flexed. So weird.</p>\n<p>He didn't look at her, but opened his eyes.</p>\n<p>\"\u2026what about you?\"</p>\n<p>\"Erasure events typically use manipulation of the emotional connection with memories to alter an individual's perception of events, rather than manipulating the events themselves.\"</p>\n<p>\"Ah\u2026so\u2026will you be affected?\"</p>\n<p>\"In the case of an erasure event, I often am not. Other times, I am. It is variable.\"</p>\n<p>She sat back. Wait.</p>\n<p>\"Has this happened before?,\" she asked, suddenly.</p>\n<p>\"Yes.\"</p>\n<p>She stared at the ceiling. Maybe it would be okay.</p>\n<p>\"One minute.\" He said. Everybody sat down, tired\u2026and waited.</p>\n<p>It was the longest sixty seconds in the whole of her existence. Everything was fading to white. She couldn't feel her arms anymore, and when she glanced down, they were gone. The tip of her nose disappeared. She saw another researcher, fading faster, reduced down to bones and nerves and a cluster of half-there organs, before he vanished altogether.</p>\n<p>She closed her eyes.</p>\n<p>The darkness itself faded to white.</p>\n<p>And then.</p>\n<p>GOOD MORNING. DO DOO DOOO\u2026BUH BA BOP BAH BA DA DA DA DA BA- GOOD MORNING! DO DOO DOOO\u2026BUH BA BOP BAH BA DA DA-</p>\n<p>She flopped her arm to the bedside table like it was a dying fish, and managed to knock her alarm clock out of reach before she finally rolled across the empty bed and reached it, jamming on the off button violently. With a soft groan, she checked the time. 5:31.</p>\n<p>It took considerable effort to get out of bed that morning. Every thought seemed to drag like concrete, every movement ached. She stumbled to the shower, and winced at herself in the mirror after turning on the water. It was only after she stuck her hand under the flow to test the temperature that she noticed the smeared ink rapidly washing off her skin, and quickly pulled her arm back. Weird, had she been writing on herself in her sleep? She looked over the remaining words, smudged from sweat and sleep.</p>\n<p>\"\u2026Ophelia, November 1st, five years old, brown ha\u2026.hair? Is that hair?\" She read and mused aloud, squinting. \"Huh\u2026okay, more\u2026uhm\u2026Topher\u2026October 24, oh, well, that's easy.\" Her brain chugged to life. She heard her husband stir in the bedroom, and groan, rolling over in his sleep. As if on cue, she could hear her daughter darting around the hallway downstairs, to the TV. Weekend! Time for cartoons!</p>\n<p>After several minutes of squinting, she realized that there was nothing else decipherable on her arm. Why had she been writing about her husband and kid? There were only other words that didn't make sense. Daysitting? No, Ophelia was in kindergarten\u2026Blonde? No, everybody was Brunette.</p>\n<p>She shook her head. Probably not important, she rationalized, shuffling into the shower and scrubbing her arm clean. The rest of the morning went featurelessly. She complained to Christopher that the toddler bed was still set up in Ophelia's old room, now relegated to storage, and he asked her why there was a box of diapers in the closet. They didn't think about it.</p>\n<p>She didn't think about it until she arrived at work, smiling at the guard as she pulled through the gate leisurely. The only thing odd about the day was when they called for a meeting and announced that SCP-7778 had been released last night, and to report any suspicious behavior or items found, as they could be classified as evidence.</p>\n<p>She was glad she must've slept through that.

Dr. Gears' list disappeared out of his hands, and he sat there, eyes closed, arms at his side like a puppet with no strings. Finally, Rights ran out of important things to write. She had started at the elbow of her left arm, and extended down to the back of her hand, with her tiny, neat handwriting. Names, dates, appearances...\n\n\n\n\"Hey, Gears?,\" Rights asked, looking down at her feet. Her ankles faded, revealing yellow fat and red muscle beneath. Her toes, just rapidly-fading bones, flexed. So weird.\n\n\n\nHe didn't look at her, but opened his eyes.\n\n\n\n\"...what about you?\"\n\n\n\n\"Erasure events typically use manipulation of the emotional connection with memories to alter an individual's perception of events, rather than manipulating the events themselves.\"\n\n\n\n\"Ah...so...will you be affected?\"\n\n\n\n\"In the case of an erasure event, I often am not. Other times, I am. It is variable.\"\n\n\n\nShe sat back. Wait.\n\n\n\n\"Has this happened before?,\" she asked, suddenly.\n\n\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\n\nShe stared at the ceiling. Maybe it would be okay.\n\n\n\n\"One minute.\" He said. Everybody sat down, tired...and waited.\n\n\n\nIt was the longest sixty seconds in the whole of her existence. Everything was fading to white. She couldn't feel her arms anymore, and when she glanced down, they were gone. The tip of her nose disappeared. She saw another researcher, fading faster, reduced down to bones and nerves and a cluster of half-there organs, before he vanished altogether.\n\n\n\nShe closed her eyes.\n\n\n\nThe darkness itself faded to white.\n\n\n\nAnd then.\n\n\n\nGOOD MORNING. DO DOO DOOO...BUH BA BOP BAH BA DA DA DA DA BA- GOOD MORNING! DO DOO DOOO...BUH BA BOP BAH BA DA DA-\n\n\n\nShe flopped her arm to the bedside table like it was a dying fish, and managed to knock her alarm clock out of reach before she finally rolled across the empty bed and reached it, jamming on the off button violently. With a soft groan, she checked the time. 5:31.\n\n\n\nIt took considerable effort to get out of bed that morning. Every thought seemed to drag like concrete, every movement ached. She stumbled to the shower, and winced at herself in the mirror after turning on the water. It was only after she stuck her hand under the flow to test the temperature that she noticed the smeared ink rapidly washing off her skin, and quickly pulled her arm back. Weird, had she been writing on herself in her sleep? She looked over the remaining words, smudged from sweat and sleep.\n\n\n\n\"...Ophelia, November 1st, five years old, brown ha....hair? Is that hair?\" She read and mused aloud, squinting. \"Huh...okay, more...uhm...Topher...October 24, oh, well, that's easy.\" Her brain chugged to life. She heard her husband stir in the bedroom, and groan, rolling over in his sleep. As if on cue, she could hear her daughter darting around the hallway downstairs, to the TV. Weekend! Time for cartoons!\n\n\n\nAfter several minutes of squinting, she realized that there was nothing else decipherable on her arm. Why had she been writing about her husband and kid? There were only other words that didn't make sense. Daysitting? No, Ophelia was in kindergarten...Blonde? No, everybody was Brunette.\n\n\n\nShe shook her head. Probably not important, she rationalized, shuffling into the shower and scrubbing her arm clean. The rest of the morning went featurelessly. She complained to Christopher that the toddler bed was still set up in Ophelia's old room, now relegated to storage, and he asked her why there was a box of diapers in the closet. They didn't think about it.\n\n\n\nShe didn't think about it until she arrived at work, smiling at the guard as she pulled through the gate leisurely. The only thing odd about the day was when they called for a meeting and announced that SCP-7778 had been released last night, and to report any suspicious behavior or items found, as they could be classified as evidence.\n\n\n\nShe was glad she must've slept through that. Sounded like a real clusterfuck.\n", "references": [], "tags": ["doctor-gears", "doctor-rights", "tale"], "title": "ClusterfREDACTED - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/clusterfredacted", "year": 2011}, "communication-log-magenta": {"created_at": "2011-10-28T21:30:00", "creator": "Tanhony", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Tanhony", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/tanhony", "comment": "", "date": "2011-10-28T21:30:00"}, {"author": "Tanhony", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/tanhony", "comment": "", "date": "2011-10-28T21:38:00"}, {"author": "Tanhony", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/tanhony", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

Uh\u2026 Right. My name is Lament. Don\u2019t call me doctor. I\u2019m not a doctor. I work for a doctor, sometimes. Anyhow, they asked me to come and talk to you guys for a little bit today. Normally, someone else does this, so\u2026 just bear with me, I guess. Right? Right. So\u2026 Listen. I\u2019m going to do my level best to get this across to you in the nicest way that I can.</p>\n<p>A lot of you are going to die. And it\u2019s going to be your own fault. I\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s just how it is. And there\u2019s a really good reason for it, too. I hear it in the lunchroom <em>every</em> day.</p>\n<p>\u2018Have you seen 682? Man, that thing will annihilate you!\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Dude, I saw 173 snap a guy's neck during the last security breach. Scariest thing I\u2019ve ever seen\u2026\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018You hear about 835? Fuck, man, it\u2019s disturbing\u2026\u2019</p>\n<p>You care about the SCPs you guard. You will. It\u2019ll happen, because it's what always happens. You get an odd, possessive quality to yourself, something you can\u2019t easily describe. When you guard 914, it is <em>yours</em>, damn it. There\u2019s pride, there. You'll love your SCP, just don't, you know, <em>love</em> your SCP. Heh\u2026 Little\u2026 Little joke there\u2026 But\u2026 uh\u2026 but that\u2019s a good thing. You get into arguments about what would be the worst one to break free or who would win in a fight. You care about what you guard. You care about what it can do. On some level, you start to love them. And that\u2019s how we know how precious all this shit\u2014even that fucking mirror who talks to you\u2014how precious it is.</p>\n<p>And really\u2026 that\u2019s where <em>you</em> fuck up.</p>\n<p>See, the problem is this: we don\u2019t really give a <em>damn</em> what an object can do. Essentially, at the root of it all\u2026 We don\u2019t. We like to know, though. Hell, we <em>have</em> to know. But that\u2019s not as important.</p>\n<p>Containing it is what\u2019s important. Doing what we have to do to keep people safe. It's why the containment comes first in all the files. It's the most important thing. You guys can still remember your parents, right? Them. We\u2019re keeping them safe. Your grandparents, your old friends\u2026 We contain these things to protect <em>them</em>.</p>\n<p>See, this is where we always fuck it up. The second they make you forget about everyone\u2026 Ahh, well\u2026 It\u2019s not important. Just remember. Right now, remember <em>this</em> feeling. <em>Hold on to it</em>.</p>\n<p>Because eventually, you\u2019re going to slip.</p>\n<p>Eventually, some of these carefully crafted procedures, something that dozens of people died so we could make sure it worked\u2026 You\u2019re going to fuck up.</p>\n<p>People will die. Maybe even you. Don't let that happen, if you can. Remember the feeling of your parents. The emotions that are tied to all those people out there. You can forget memories, but it's hard to forget the emotions tied to it. You ever hear of Little Albert? Same thing.</p>\n<p>Anyhow, sorry to be such a downer. Doctor\u2026 Rights? Is that right?

I'll see you guys around the water cooler, right?</p>\n</div></body></html>", "raw_source": "\n\t[[>]]\n\n[[module Rate]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\nHey there, guys. Uh... Right. My name is Lament. Don\u2019t call me doctor. I\u2019m not a doctor.\u00a0\u00a0I work for a doctor, sometimes. Anyhow, they asked me to come and talk to you guys for a little bit today. Normally, someone else does this, so... just bear with me, I guess. Right? Right.\u00a0\u00a0So\u2026 Listen. I\u2019m going to do my level best to get this across to you in the nicest way that I can.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nA lot of you are going to die.\u00a0\u00a0And it\u2019s going to be your own fault.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s just how it is.\u00a0\u00a0And there\u2019s a really good reason for it, too. I hear it in the lunchroom //every// day.\n\n\n\n\u2018Have you seen 682? Man, that thing will annihilate you!\u2019\n\n\n\n\u2018Dude, I saw 173 snap a guy's neck during the last security breach. Scariest thing I\u2019ve ever seen\u2026\u2019\n\n\n\n\u2018You hear about 835? Fuck, man, it\u2019s disturbing\u2026\u2019\n\n\n\nYou care about the SCPs you guard.\u00a0\u00a0You will. It\u2019ll happen, because it's what always happens.\u00a0\u00a0You get an odd, possessive quality to yourself, something you can\u2019t easily describe.\u00a0\u00a0When you guard 914, it is //yours//, damn it.\u00a0\u00a0There\u2019s pride, there.\u00a0\u00a0You'll love your SCP, just don't, you know, //love// your SCP. Heh... Little... Little joke there... But... uh... but that\u2019s a good thing.\u00a0\u00a0You get into arguments about what would be the worst one to break free or who would win in a fight.\u00a0\u00a0You care about what you guard. You care about what it can do.\u00a0\u00a0On some level, you start to love them.\u00a0\u00a0And that\u2019s how we know how precious all this shit\u2014even that fucking mirror who talks to you\u2014how precious it is. \n\n\n\nAnd really... that\u2019s where //you// fuck up.\n\n\n\nSee, the problem is this: we don\u2019t really give a //damn// what an object can do.\u00a0\u00a0Essentially, at the root of it all\u2026 We don\u2019t.\u00a0\u00a0We like to know, though. Hell, we //have// to know.\u00a0\u00a0But that\u2019s not as important.\n\n\n\nContaining it is what\u2019s important. Doing what we have to do to keep people safe.\u00a0\u00a0It's why the containment comes first in all the files. It's the most important thing.\u00a0\u00a0You guys can still remember your parents, right?\u00a0\u00a0Them.\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019re keeping them safe.\u00a0\u00a0Your grandparents, your old friends\u2026 We contain these things to protect //them//.\n\n\n\nSee, this is where we always fuck it up. The second they make you forget about everyone\u2026 Ahh, well\u2026 It\u2019s not important.\u00a0\u00a0Just remember. Right now, remember //this// feeling. //Hold on to it//. \n\n\n\nBecause eventually, you\u2019re going to slip. \n\n\n\nEventually, some of these carefully crafted procedures, something that dozens of people died so we could make sure it worked\u2026 You\u2019re going to fuck up.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nPeople will die. Maybe even you.\u00a0\u00a0Don't let that happen, if you can. Remember the feeling of your parents.\u00a0\u00a0The emotions that are tied to all those people out there. You can forget memories, but it's hard to forget the emotions tied to it. You ever hear of Little Albert? Same thing.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nAnyhow, sorry to be such a downer.\u00a0\u00a0Doctor\u2026 Rights? Is that right? Doctor Rights is going to make sure you\u2019re all good and healthy, give you some drinks. Don't bite the pill, just swallow it. \n\n\n\nAnd remember, alright? Especially for the next little bit?\u00a0\u00a0Try?\n\n\n\nI... Uh... Yeah. Sorry, Doctor. Your show now. I'll see you guys around the water cooler, right?\n", "references": [], "tags": ["agent-lament", "doctor-rights", "orientation", "tale"], "title": "Contain Yourself - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/containing-yourself", "year": 2011}, "corn-starch": {"created_at": "2011-07-20T15:07:00", "creator": "tunedtoadeadchannel", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "tunedtoadeadchannel", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/tunedtoadeadchannel", "comment": "", "date": "2011-07-20T15:07:00"}, {"author": "tunedtoadeadchannel", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/tunedtoadeadchannel", "comment": "", "date": "2011-07-20T15:09:00"}, {"author": "tunedtoadeadchannel", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/tunedtoadeadchannel", "comment": "", "date": "2011-07-20T15:17:00"}, {"author": "tunedtoadeadchannel", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/tunedtoadeadchannel", "comment": "", "date": "2011-07-21T20:16:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

'Him' being Robert E. Brooks, chief of human resources at Site 19. \"We've been working on this SCP for the past four months and we've gotten nowhere. It doesn't do anything besides play shit with people's minds and act as a short-range microwave. My team is tired - <em>I'm tired</em> - of running test after pointless test, always getting nothing, because there is nothing. There isn't anything left to figure out.\"</p>\n<p>\"Dr. Daveson, I told you already, there is nothing we can do. You signed on for the term, you can't transfer until it's over. I'm sorry.\" His sausage fingers rifled through a stack of forms.</p>\n<p>\"Fine. Just look over the papers. Look over what we've done, look for openings anywhere. \" He tried to reply, I could see him forming 'No', with his lips. So I turned around and left. Nineteen has these enormous wooden doors leading into offices, I made sure to slam them on the way out.</p>\n<p>There was a hallway between me and the security checkpoint when I started noticing the assistants rushing up and down between labs weren't making eye contact with me, they probably thought I was about to kill someone. I walked down the checkpoint, two guards were ready to meet me. \"Intimidating\", that's one word to describe the security at nineteen. Massive men with jet-black body armour and face masks. They gave me the rub-down, I gave them a blank stare.</p>\n<p>I let out a heavy sigh when the garage lamps buzzed into life. I checked my watch, it was a half hour to midnight, I never realized how late it'd gotten. Lights flickered above me, and even though I couldn't see the outdoors it felt like the night. Most of the vehicles were gone, but the night staff's were still here. The stiff scent of old concrete covered everything, but I greeted the musty smell of my Cadillac with a sigh. I turned the key in the ignition, and frowned as the car started.</p>\n<p>I lied when I told Brooks that we had done all we could. The last experiment alone had given us plenty of questions that were still unanswered. We had Foundation grants to work with, enough D-Class to last us a decade. My team was happy with the work, and I liked it too. It's none of that which made me want to leave. It was what happened when I slept, it was the dreams.</p>\n<p>The same dream. Every. Single. Day.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I open my eyes.</p>\n<p>Everything is vivid, but blurry. Goddamn it, it's like broken glasses, giving me a headache. I try looking around, and realize that these 'glasses' are covered in paint. I blink, or at least I try to blink. It doesn't seem to work. I try wiping my eyes, my arms don't seem to work either.</p>\n<p>I feel like an observer, like I'm looking through my eyes but I don't control them. I see shapes move, and my - are they really mine? - eyes follow them. They all glow, softly, warmly. I can't make out their features, but I have the overwhelming feeling that they're good people. They all take seats in something in front of me. A table. A few more blurs shuffle into the room and sit down, they bow their heads. Something comes through the walls, these bright, yellow things. They sit around the corners of the room, they don't move much. I think they have wings. The blurs lift their heads, and suddenly everything changes.</p>\n<p>The sound of breaking glass, my vision clears. They're all people, I know now, all the blurs are people. Some young, children. They all look scared. The yellow things are sharper, whiter, golden. Feathery wings rest at their sides, hovering above the ground almost gracefully.</p>\n<p>Everything changes again, damnit the paint is all over my eyes, an explosion, all the people are rushing, screaming, shouting. I see panic on their faces, the little children cry. Figures in black. They come down the stairs two rooms over. Pain courses all over me, bullets fly, they kill one of the children. They kill all the innocent. It hurts so bad to see them die, but I can't even cry. The yellow things' wings fly out, they descend like enormous shields to protect all the blurs, the people. One of the dark men toss up a canister, it erupts in a red cloud. All the yellow things, all the - the, angels? they perish. Die, all the people choke, cough, collapse.</p>\n<p>The men come closer. They examine the bodies, check for life, but they already know that no one survived. I know it too. They come closer to me, I can see the insignia on their uniforms. It is that too familiar symbol of containment, circle and arrow, it is the Foundation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A few weeks passed, and then the day came. \"Tim!\" I knew that voice. Claire was a seasoned doctor, but she always seemed to have the enthusiasm of a junior researcher.</p>\n<p>My groggy eyes rose up from behind a pile of forms to see her \"Yes, Dr. Claire?\"</p>\n<p>\"Results from the latest spectrum analysis!\" She dumped a stack of papers onto my desk, her smile hovering slightly above the top of the pile. If it was any other person I would have thought they were trying to piss me off, but Claire was different. Besides, getting angry at her would have disrupted her walk out of my office, viewing her from behind was a highlight of my days.</p>\n<p>As the door shut, I felt the gentle gust of wind that accompanied it. Some papers caught it, their edges lifting up, but clips made sure they stayed in stacks. The room became silent again. I remember hating it. It was a tomb made of drywall, forms and similarity. Whenever I was in that room I looked forward to leaving it.</p>\n<p>I read into the sheets Claire had left behind. The SCP we had been working on, all data analysis of wavelength variation. After the last experiment resulted in a containment breach of half a dozen SCPs, O5 restricted personnel exposure. All we had left was wavelength analysis, and psychological testing. Everything else was off-limits, I appealed, I thought we could get more done if we had just a few more tests, but it was denied. The other doctors thought that preventing long-term exposure, and keeping the guards rotated would stop it from reaching out to other people. I don't believe that anymore.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Time doesn't work right in my dream. Sometimes things move faster, sometimes slower, sometimes not at all. You only get bits and pieces, you can grasp a few things but lose others. But most of it, I understand. All the pain when your family dies, all the anger, hate, suffering. I would be angry, too.</p>\n<p>A thousand things all pass at once. The time in my dream skips. Suddenly I arrive in a room, a white room, a single light illuminates the box around me. A bed colored gray is against the farthest wall, it lacks a pillow, and is just a thin cushion against a cold metal frame. But it is not for me, or the eyes which I see through, I don't have a body which could rest against that bed. A shelf and desk lay to the right of me, both cold, hard metal. The shelf is filled with mostly old, tasteless, and useless literature. The desk has only a pen and a stack of paper.</p>\n<p>I don't know the time, I only see half-formed shapes move outside the room. They move quickly, too quickly to be human. Or is it that I'm moving too quickly to see them as human? It doesn't matter. All I know is that this is alone, this is isolation. I don't like it.</p>\n<p>Across the room, in the reflection of the wall, I see myself. I don't have a body, I don't have arms or legs or anything. I - It is a symbol of love?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I looked at the stack of papers on my desk, graphs, charts, diagrams abundant. I slid them all to the side, and reached down to a low knob on my desk drawers, the wooden frame opening with a loud creak. A thick pile of melange folders bulged out of the wooden coffin. I carefully pushed them forward, searching for the lowest folder. Ah, there it was, just above an oddly-shaped lump I had placed there not long ago. I pulled the folder out, and laid it on my desk. Photographs spilled over the wood, accompanied by a number of written files.</p>\n<p>The drift of my hand caught the edge of the folder, it opened to let its contents be read. Pictures of the bodies of people killed, pictures of that SCP in that damned room. I was trapped in here by the Foundation, by our protocol, by our duty. We were supposed to safeguard mankind, but all we did was produced an imaginary farce for the world to live in while we stymied the tides of unknown, efforts which only made humanity more and more vulnerable. The SCP of my dreams was trapped by the Foundation, by our protocol, by our duty. It could have given so many gifts to our world, but all we did was lock it away.</p>\n<p>I didn't realize all this at first, the first time I had the dreams. It was three days before I authorized the first D-Class testing under the supervision of Dr. Dier that I first had them.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Suddenly the door flies open, a figure bursts in. Everything slows down to normal speed. It's a person. I see the face for a moment, before things start getting faster. He is a D-Class, he is a slave to the Foundation. He walks around, reads, leaves, returns, claws himself. I don't understand.</p>\n<p>I hear his voice, he calls out. His pain, he is so alone. Then I, I? Something responds, from me, but I didn't say it. It is the eyes I see through which speak to him. They tell him not to fear, that soon all the pain will be gone, that his suffering will serve to help him. He fears, but accepts my, my? The words. He accepts. He grows weaker, or is it stronger? His form changes, becoming closer and closer to the image in the metal mirror. He becomes closer to love? He contorts, his body is in agony. Somewhere, deep beneath his body something stirs, his soul?</p>\n<p>All the blurs think he suffers. But they don't understand. They watch, and despite all their safety, despite all their precautions, the symbol, I? It? enters them, enters into their memories. They don't realize it, but I do. Just through their sight of it, because they remember it, it will forever be with them. It will watch them. But there's something about the memory, something strange. It is diluted, unfinished, imperfect.</p>\n<p>Oh my god he changes, the man on the ground, he changes oh god he changes so different. I recognize that image, it's the same as the reflection, it's love. Everything relaxes. Heart stops. Brain stops. But he does not die.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Everyone thought D-3466 was going to die. Everyone thinks that D-3466 is dead. I <em>thought</em> that he would die. But as my eyes looked over those files, as I thought about my dreams, I realized, I did not give him death, I gave him eternal life.</p>\n<p>The dreams made me eager for work, eager to learn more. But they also made me afraid. I leaned back and forth, I wanted to stay but I had to <em>get out</em>. I went to try to get transferred, but Brooks put up a wall I could not pull down. The dreams got stronger, I started day dreaming them, they kept coming and coming. I didn't understand them, I didn't know what was happening to me. But on that afternoon all those days ago, Dr. Claire didn't stir me from work, she awoke me from my dreams. She awoke me from when my dreams changed, she awoke me and I understood what I had to do.</p>\n<p>I sighed, looked down onto old hardwood. I reached into the bottom of the opened drawer, and my hand drew out a Colt Single Action Army.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A fear in me grows, quickly, unstoppable. My dream should end when I see the angel of D-3466. No. This isn't right. Why is it going? Why do the men outside the room darken? I can feel their hatred, why won't it stop? Stop!

'Him' being Robert E. Brooks, chief of human resources at Site 19. \"We've been working on this SCP for the past four months and we've gotten nowhere. It doesn't do anything besides play shit with people's minds and act as a short-range microwave. My team is tired - //I'm tired// - of running test after pointless test, always getting nothing, because there is nothing. There isn't anything left to figure out.\"\n\n\n\n\"Dr. Daveson, I told you already, there is nothing we can do. You signed on for the term, you can't transfer until it's over. I'm sorry.\" His sausage fingers rifled through a stack of forms.\n\n\n\n\"Fine. Just look over the papers. Look over what we've done, look for openings anywhere. \" He tried to reply, I could see him forming 'No', with his lips. So I turned around and left. Nineteen has these enormous wooden doors leading into offices, I made sure to slam them on the way out.\n\n\n\nThere was a hallway between me and the security checkpoint when I started noticing the assistants rushing up and down between labs weren't making eye contact with me, they probably thought I was about to kill someone. I walked down the checkpoint, two guards were ready to meet me. \"Intimidating\", that's one word to describe the security at nineteen. Massive men with jet-black body armour and face masks. They gave me the rub-down, I gave them a blank stare.\n\n\n\nI let out a heavy sigh when the garage lamps buzzed into life. I checked my watch, it was a half hour to midnight, I never realized how late it'd gotten. Lights flickered above me, and even though I couldn't see the outdoors it felt like the night. Most of the vehicles were gone, but the night staff's were still here. The stiff scent of old concrete covered everything, but I greeted the musty smell of my Cadillac with a sigh. I turned the key in the ignition, and frowned as the car started. \n\n\n\nI lied when I told Brooks that we had done all we could. The last experiment alone had given us plenty of questions that were still unanswered. We had Foundation grants to work with, enough D-Class to last us a decade. My team was happy with the work, and I liked it too. It's none of that which made me want to leave. It was what happened when I slept, it was the dreams.\n\n\n\nThe same dream. Every. Single. Day.\n\n\n\n> I open my eyes.\n\n> \n\n> Everything is vivid, but blurry. Goddamn it, it's like broken glasses, giving me a headache. I try looking around, and realize that these 'glasses' are covered in paint. I blink, or at least I try to blink. It doesn't seem to work. I try wiping my eyes, my arms don't seem to work either. \n\n> \n\n> I feel like an observer, like I'm looking through my eyes but I don't control them. I see shapes move, and my - are they really mine? - eyes follow them. They all glow, softly, warmly. I can't make out their features, but I have the overwhelming feeling that they're good people. They all take seats in something in front of me. A table. A few more blurs shuffle into the room and sit down, they bow their heads. Something comes through the walls, these bright, yellow things. They sit around the corners of the room, they don't move much. I think they have wings. The blurs lift their heads, and suddenly everything changes. \n\n> \n\n> The sound of breaking glass, my vision clears. They're all people, I know now, all the blurs are people. Some young, children. They all look scared. The yellow things are sharper, whiter, golden. Feathery wings rest at their sides, hovering above the ground almost gracefully. \n\n> \n\n> Everything changes again, damnit the paint is all over my eyes, an explosion, all the people are rushing, screaming, shouting. I see panic on their faces, the little children cry. Figures in black. They come down the stairs two rooms over. Pain courses all over me, bullets fly, they kill one of the children. They kill all the innocent. It hurts so bad to see them die, but I can't even cry. The yellow things' wings fly out, they descend like enormous shields to protect all the blurs, the people. One of the dark men toss up a canister, it erupts in a red cloud. All the yellow things, all the - the, angels? they perish. Die, all the people choke, cough, collapse.\n\n> \n\n> The men come closer. They examine the bodies, check for life, but they already know that no one survived. I know it too. They come closer to me, I can see the insignia on their uniforms. It is that too familiar symbol of containment, circle and arrow, it is the Foundation.\n\n\n\nA few weeks passed, and then the day came. \"Tim!\" I knew that voice. Claire was a seasoned doctor, but she always seemed to have the enthusiasm of a junior researcher. \n\n\n\nMy groggy eyes rose up from behind a pile of forms to see her \"Yes, Dr. Claire?\"\n\n\n\n\"Results from the latest spectrum analysis!\" She dumped a stack of papers onto my desk, her smile hovering slightly above the top of the pile. If it was any other person I would have thought they were trying to piss me off, but Claire was different. Besides, getting angry at her would have disrupted her walk out of my office, viewing her from behind was a highlight of my days.\n\n\n\nAs the door shut, I felt the gentle gust of wind that accompanied it. Some papers caught it, their edges lifting up, but clips made sure they stayed in stacks. The room became silent again. I remember hating it. It was a tomb made of drywall, forms and similarity. Whenever I was in that room I looked forward to leaving it. \n\n\n\nI read into the sheets Claire had left behind. The SCP we had been working on, all data analysis of wavelength variation. After the last experiment resulted in a containment breach of half a dozen SCPs, O5 restricted personnel exposure. All we had left was wavelength analysis, and psychological testing. Everything else was off-limits, I appealed, I thought we could get more done if we had just a few more tests, but it was denied. The other doctors thought that preventing long-term exposure, and keeping the guards rotated would stop it from reaching out to other people. I don't believe that anymore.\n\n\n\n> Time doesn't work right in my dream. Sometimes things move faster, sometimes slower, sometimes not at all. You only get bits and pieces, you can grasp a few things but lose others. But most of it, I understand. All the pain when your family dies, all the anger, hate, suffering. I would be angry, too.\n\n> \n\n> A thousand things all pass at once. The time in my dream skips. Suddenly I arrive in a room, a white room, a single light illuminates the box around me. A bed colored gray is against the farthest wall, it lacks a pillow, and is just a thin cushion against a cold metal frame. But it is not for me, or the eyes which I see through, I don't have a body which could rest against that bed. A shelf and desk lay to the right of me, both cold, hard metal. The shelf is filled with mostly old, tasteless, and useless literature. The desk has only a pen and a stack of paper.\n\n> \n\n> I don't know the time, I only see half-formed shapes move outside the room. They move quickly, too quickly to be human. Or is it that I'm moving too quickly to see them as human? It doesn't matter. All I know is that this is alone, this is isolation. I don't like it.\n\n> \n\n> Across the room, in the reflection of the wall, I see myself. I don't have a body, I don't have arms or legs or anything. I - It is a symbol of love?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nI looked at the stack of papers on my desk, graphs, charts, diagrams abundant. I slid them all to the side, and reached down to a low knob on my desk drawers, the wooden frame opening with a loud creak. A thick pile of melange folders bulged out of the wooden coffin. I carefully pushed them forward, searching for the lowest folder. Ah, there it was, just above an oddly-shaped lump I had placed there not long ago. I pulled the folder out, and laid it on my desk. Photographs spilled over the wood, accompanied by a number of written files.\n\n\n\nThe drift of my hand caught the edge of the folder, it opened to let its contents be read. Pictures of the bodies of people killed, pictures of that SCP in that damned room. I was trapped in here by the Foundation, by our protocol, by our duty. We were supposed to safeguard mankind, but all we did was produced an imaginary farce for the world to live in while we stymied the tides of unknown, efforts which only made humanity more and more vulnerable. The SCP of my dreams was trapped by the Foundation, by our protocol, by our duty. It could have given so many gifts to our world, but all we did was lock it away. \n\n\n\nI didn't realize all this at first, the first time I had the dreams. It was three days before I authorized the first D-Class testing under the supervision of Dr. Dier that I first had them.\n\n\n\n> Suddenly the door flies open, a figure bursts in. Everything slows down to normal speed. It's a person. I see the face for a moment, before things start getting faster. He is a D-Class, he is a slave to the Foundation. He walks around, reads, leaves, returns, claws himself. I don't understand.\n\n> \n\n> I hear his voice, he calls out. His pain, he is so alone. Then I, I? Something responds, from me, but I didn't say it. It is the eyes I see through which speak to him. They tell him not to fear, that soon all the pain will be gone, that his suffering will serve to help him. He fears, but accepts my, my? The words. He accepts. He grows weaker, or is it stronger? His form changes, becoming closer and closer to the image in the metal mirror. He becomes closer to love? He contorts, his body is in agony. Somewhere, deep beneath his body something stirs, his soul?\n\n> \n\n> All the blurs think he suffers. But they don't understand. They watch, and despite all their safety, despite all their precautions, the symbol, I? It? enters them, enters into their memories. They don't realize it, but I do. Just through their sight of it, because they remember it, it will forever be with them. It will watch them. But there's something about the memory, something strange. It is diluted, unfinished, imperfect. \n\n> \n\n> Oh my god he changes, the man on the ground, he changes oh god he changes so different. I recognize that image, it's the same as the reflection, it's love. Everything relaxes. Heart stops. Brain stops. But he does not die.\n\n\n\nEveryone thought D-3466 was going to die. Everyone thinks that D-3466 is dead. I //thought// that he would die. But as my eyes looked over those files, as I thought about my dreams, I realized, I did not give him death, I gave him eternal life.\n\n\n\nThe dreams made me eager for work, eager to learn more. But they also made me afraid. I leaned back and forth, I wanted to stay but I had to //get out//. I went to try to get transferred, but Brooks put up a wall I could not pull down. The dreams got stronger, I started day dreaming them, they kept coming and coming. I didn't understand them, I didn't know what was happening to me. But on that afternoon all those days ago, Dr. Claire didn't stir me from work, she awoke me from my dreams. She awoke me from when my dreams changed, she awoke me and I understood what I had to do.\n\n\n\nI sighed, looked down onto old hardwood. I reached into the bottom of the opened drawer, and my hand drew out a Colt Single Action Army.\n\n\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0A fear in me grows, quickly, unstoppable. My dream should end when I see the angel of D-3466. No. This isn't right. Why is it going? Why do the men outside the room darken? I can feel their hatred, why won't it stop? Stop! STOP!\n\n> \n\n> I want to cry. I want to cry so badly, I don't understand why does it keep going. The lights are brighter, stronger, they flash and turn red, get erratic, spray the room in their glow. Alarms screech in the air, get louder and louder and louder. Shadows of men pass outside the room. What the fuck is that? Gunshots?\n\n\n\nThe door of my office closed, a tomb of drywall which I would never enter again. I felt my breath against my lips as I exhaled, as I stepped closer and closer to the point of no return. My mind leaked, the dreams entered by wakened mind. Oh my god. . . \n\n\n\n\"Sir? Are you alright?\" A young guard asked me as I passed through the checkpoint between me and my dreams.\n\n\n\n\"Get the fuck out of my way.\" His brains exploded into the wall.\n\n\n\n>\u00a0\u00a0Fucking bullets, fuck.

Now, imagine it suddenly being stabbed open by some invisible, incomprehensible thing.\u00a0\u00a0The world cracking open like a filthy, blue egg\u2014oceans falling down the sides helplessly, the lava generating huge gouts of steam. And an uneven keening sound.\u00a0\u00a0You may imagine that it's the sudden steam, but I've lived long enough to know better.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt's screaming.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nNow... imagine falling into that. Falling and falling and falling until you hit the ground. And when you get up... it looks like the same, damned place. The same people.\u00a0\u00a0Evolution is, if nothing else, remarkably consistent. \n\n\n\nNow, do that for a thousand lifetimes. And tell me you don't feel guilt. \n\n\n\nI feel old. And I am old. But I'm also nearly done.\u00a0\u00a0After this one, I should be able to put my work to use... To change things for the better.\u00a0\u00a0Which made it so much worse when you walked in my office.\u00a0\u00a0And I knew, when you looked at me, what you were about to do.\n\n\n\n\"I //can// explain,\" I say.\u00a0\u00a0But the gun is leveled at my chest. And I know that I'm out of supplies.\u00a0\u00a0I reach into my pocket quietly, pulling out the key card and my diary.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"You don't know what this means for you,\" I say.\n\n\n\n\"It means you aren't going to kill us all,\" you respond.\n\n\n\nI stand up. I look at you closely and shake my head. \"No. It means that //you'll// have to. The key code is Thaum\u2014\"\n\n\n\nThe shot echoes in the small room, and I feel the hollow point hitting my chest like a sledge hammer, feel ribs splintering and sinking into my lung, my organs being ravaged. And I smile. And I laugh. And through bloody spittle, I manage to barely gasp enough breath to speak.\n\n\n\n\"Good luck,\" I say. You're not smiling.\n\n\n\nAnd I hope, for the millionth time, that all universes share one heaven.\u00a0\u00a0And I hope, for the millionth time, that I can see you in it from [[[mackenzie-s-proposal|my special hell]]].\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["mackenzie-s-proposal", "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "licensing-guide", "licensing-master-list"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "project-thaumiel", "tale", "the-administrator"], "title": "Corvus - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/corvus", "year": 2011}, "critters": {"created_at": "2011-08-29T23:28:00", "creator": "Dexanote", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Dexanote", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dexanote", "comment": "", "date": "2011-08-29T23:28:00"}, {"author": "Dexanote", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dexanote", "comment": "", "date": "2011-08-29T23:38:00"}, {"author": "Dexanote", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dexanote", "comment": "", "date": "2011-08-29T23:53:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

If you would all just turn your attention\u2026 Okay, settle down now, I need to\u2026 If I could just have your-quiet! I said quiet! I said-will you all just please-I said-SHUT THE <strong>FUCK UP!</strong></p>\n<p>Ahem. Now that I have your attention, we may begin. I am Junior Assistant Researcher Doc-I SAID SHUT THE HELL UP! Okay, like I was saying, I will be leading your orientation today. Now, you may all be wondering where you are. That's classified. You may be wondering who we are. That is also classified. However, I <em>can</em> tell you that we are a form of a research facility.</p>\n<p>As you may remember, one of our agents approached each and every one of you and gave you an offer. You could either wait out your term on death row, or you could volunteer to participate in our testing facilities for the span of one month. Obviously, you agreed to cooperate. This entails-what? What do you mean you didn't agree? We told you that if you participate, you're free to go at the end of the month, who wouldn't take a deal like-guard, excuse me, guard, please take him-yeah, that one-to the, yeah, the third door on the left-thank you. Like I said, if you can make it through the testing procedures, we-no, I don't hear any screaming. If you can make it through the testing procedures, we let you go at the end of the month. You know, provided you cooperate fully. Sounds like a good deal, right? Was there anyone else who didn't agree? Okay then, moving on.</p>\n<p>Like I said, provided you can survive the entire month, you get to go free. No, of course it's not a death sentence. I-no, see, when I said \"survive\" I meant it like, \"cooperate with us\" you know? I mean, <em>yeah</em>, it's dangerous stuff, that's why we're using death row inmates. No, no, most of the stuff here is pretty harmless, I meant dangerous like, you know, the way a bomb is dangerous if you fuck around with it. I mean, you <em>will</em> be fucking around with it, but you should be pretty safe if you just do what we tell you. Worst thing that'll happen is your toes will tingle a few minutes afterwards. Last batch of D-Class? Not a single one died, all got to go free at the end of the month. I was there, too. Watched'em scamper back into the wilderness myself. Like a bunch of adorable, homicidal kittens. Just do what we tell you and you'll get to go home to see your loving wife and kids. Well, not you. Says here you killed your wife and kids. Must have been awkward to explain to the in-laws, eh? Heh, no, I really don't want you to tell us how you did it, I can guess.</p>\n<p>Right. At the end of this orientation you will be directed down the hall where you will get your numerical designation tattooed on your wrist and chest. This will be mostly painless, and once you-Hmm? Why your chest? Well, in the event of an explosion, it's most likely that it'll be the largest intact chunk of meat left.</p>\n<p>Hahahaha! I'm joking! Of course I'm joking! Yes I'm sure! That is very, <em>very</em> unlikely to happen. We haven't had an explosion for the past two months! Ha, look at him! He thought I was serious! Heh heh, but, ah, no. You will actually be getting your designation tattooed on your chest. I was not joking about that. Well, if you want, you can get it removed at the end of the month. No, no charge at all. It's a pretty painless procedure, actually.</p>\n<p>Okay, once you get your new tattoo, you will be escorted to D-Block Alpha-6. This will be your new dormitory; you will eat, sleep, and bathe there. No, you were spoiled in prison, you will not be getting your own cell. I don't even have my own office, and you want your own cell? Anyways, you will be under constant video surveillance to ensure no shenanigans. We don't want any of that funny jail-time business here; you shank someone, you will be escorted behind the chemical\u2026 back to death row. Pretty much, if you piss us off, you get sent back to death row. Yeah. Seriously. A month of testing, and you go free. Don't screw it up.</p>\n<p>Okay, that pretty much wraps it up. Any questions? You, with the-good LORD, man, did you take a round of buckshot to the face? Yeah, your question. Sure, we have a fantastic team of doctors here, best in the world. Don't worry about your medical insurance here, it won't matter anyways. Next?</p>\n<p>Uh\u2026 you, second to the back. No, it's too late to choose death row over here, I don't know why you would want to in the first place. Well, you've got a giant swastika carved into your face, so I don't think you're the best at making life decisions.</p>\n<p>One more\u2026 ahh\u2026 yes, you, the one missing the ear. That's not really a question. No, phrasing it to ask how many she can fit doesn't count as a question. You-my mother was a saint, if you say one more word-guard, please, if you could-there we go\u2026 No no, it's fine, I'll send the janitor down later. See? Just stay in line and cooperate. One month, and you're gone. Never have to see this place again. Really, that simple. Alright, the next batch of D's are coming down now, guards, if you could escort them out please. That's right, Alpha-6. Okay, thank you very much. Really, I don't care what he said, she was a saint. Yeah, let me know when this batch gets released this month, I want to watch.</p>\n<p>Ahem.

Fuck!\n\n\n\n> \n\n> You and your technology and hatred for the weak and unknown. You seek to maintain the status quo, to keep the lowest the lowest and the highest the highest. I gave love to the forgotten and now you strike them back down, you strike them to their death so that they are lost forever. I feel their deaths, their loss. You used your hateful cloud to burn my markings from their flesh, to burn their life away. You scorched my face from everything you found, because you did not know who I was, you only knew that those who once suffered no longer suffer, and you you must make them suffer once again again. They are all dying.\n\n\n\n**22:53 - 442 seconds post engagement**\n\n\n\nMTF-Pi-1-1: We have multiple casualties, Delta was killed in crossfire, Beta by shrapnel from the canister.

Look for suspect SCP.\n\n\n\n[low sobbing can be heard over the radio for the next 420 seconds, both remaining MTF members deny that it is coming from either of them]\n\n\n\nMTF-Pi-1-1: Numerous symbols on posters, clothing, the walls, their skin, all emit energy in the high EM bandwidth.\n\n\n\nOP-Sigma-5: Alpha, retrieve two articles of clothing and one poster. We have Intel that local residents are reporting a disturbance at your location, you may be compromised. Zeta prepare contingency plan 540-CHARLIE-BURNOUT. We don't want any more exposure, so Alpha sweep the East side and retrieve any possible explosives, otherwise the fire may cause detonation.

You killed all of them. I can feel them drifting away. Dozens of men women children souls, all of them lost, hurting, alone. I loved them. I love them them all so much and you you you take them away from me. I cared for them. I help loved them. Now they are dead dead all dead, to what ends? You call me a monster a dark monster a horrible monster? No, you are the monster. You killed them. You you are the ONE WHO slaughters SLAUGHTERS to build a fortress from bodies of INNOCENCE innocence only the innocent you killed them. you killed all of them they are dead now they are gone only gone forever gone. you took their lives away, you kill undo all the good UNDO kill what i tried to accomplish undo so now i undo you\n\n> \n\n> [[=]]\n\n> [[image reallyud2.jpg]]\n\n> [[/=]]\n\n\n\n**Addendum-Sigma-5**: Shortly after operation Sigma-5 a file entitled 'Dear Cavalier' was discovered by researcher \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 within Site \u2588\u2588's database.

Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 externally manipulated and transferred the file into a 500MB CD-ROM, which is now stored in Site-46.

Recording options alone could cover a good portion of this budget hemorrhage.</p>\n<p>Dark's lips curled in a wintery, predatory smile. He played with a pen, doodling blasphemy as he looked over a small spray of photos on his desk. He lifted one, depicting a hulking brute with a bag head, blurry and unaware of the observation\u2026 or uncaring. The Bagman had been content to do its own business for some time now, rising from time to time to devil those witless enough to still hold to magic and faith. Rogue, yes, dangerous, yes, but sometimes a mad dog was better then no dog at all. Perhaps others should be made aware of its \"usefulness.\" No need to mention the absolute disdain for authority and control.</p>\n<p>Dark hated to travel. He had not enjoyed any of his visits to the States since helping that Anderson fellow set up his factory. Too bad Anderson was gone; HE wouldn\u2019t have let things get out of control like this, or at the bloody least, gleaned a profit from it. He prepared a note to Marshall and Carter. They would not be pleased \u2013 they liked Dark out of day-to-day operations as much as he wished to stay out of them, warmly ensconced in The Museum. Still his best \"purchase\" to date, regardless of the undying animosity of The Library and its parasites. Still, sometimes it was required to stir the ashes, remind everyone of what their damn jobs were. They were here to provide wonders beyond limit for their discerning club members.</p>\n<p>It was about bloody time to cause some wonder.</p>\n<p>He snatched up a glossy black phone headset, punching numbers and causing a distant phone to ring. Dark sighed, tapping fingers on the smooth dome of a yeti skull. Finally the other end picked up, and he shifted forward, starting to scribble.</p>\n<p>\"Were you off for a bloody coffee break, Cheryl? So sorry to upset your routine, but I need the New York club notified to have my rooms ready within the hour. I'll be flying out shortly, have Mr. McCreedy ready up a ten-man team for quick action, have Bobby head it up.\"</p>\n<p>\"\u2026 What? Why the bloody, bloody hell was he committed? \u2026 Really? That's tragic, Cheryl, but that's no reason to take him off active roll. Get him loose and cleaned up and over to the club immediately. I'm going to get this goddamn rubbish back on track manually, and I want him right on the point.\"</p>\n<p>\"\u2026 That's a good girl, Cheryl. Oh, and one more thing, dearie. Call Boomer, and have him blow a little kiss to Agent Harken. He's thumbed his sodding nose at us a bit too much, it's time he knows that we have taken notice.\"</p>\n<p>He hung up, leaning back and looking up to the bust of Caligula over the door. Mr. Dark smiled with true warmth, tapping his lips. That dear boy Boomer\u2026 not the sharpest razor in the apple, but a sweet lad all the same. He had the rather useful opinion that anything worth doing was worth doing with massive property damage. Inelegant, yes, but the idea of Harken burning or splattering in his bed was enough to warm even Mr. Dark's pinched heart.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Carter was waiting on the tarmac when Dark's jet landed. Various attendants, along with the New York club director were ranked behind him, every one of them with the same strained, nervous smile. Nothing good ever came from Mr. Dark visiting the States. It immediately put him in poor humor at the best of times, and with things as they were right now\u2026</p>\n<p>Carter repressed a shiver as the door slowly opened. Two tiny Asian attendants (identical female twins) scrambled out, carrying a cigar case and a opened umbrella. Next was Dark's longest-running secretary Cheryl, looking harried but still hard as a iron wrecking ball.</p>\n<p>And then the puppeteer himself, Mr. Dark, elegantly shabby, like a bitter old owl, snapping at everyone in reach, hitting his attendants with the tip of his cane when they fell so much as a step behind. Staff swarmed to the jet to get his voluminous luggage as Dark snatched up a cigar, the attendant ready with the match almost before he had it in his mouth. He turned, and caught sight of Carter standing at attention. He turned and faced him, a thick cloud of smoke pouring slowly from his nostrils. Carter stiffened, swallowing thickly.</p>\n<p>Oh shit, here we go.</p>\n<p>Dark crossed in a haze of smoke. Behind him, an unlucky porter dropped a heavy steamer trunk of luggage with a loud crash. \"Fire him,\" Dark said, without breaking stride. Carter felt some of the tension leave him. Dark was in a good mood: the last man to damage one of his possessions had been shot in the head.</p>\n<p>All too soon he was there, glaring up at Carter, the thick and oddly spicy smell of his cigars curling around him like strangling hands. \"Well, so good to see you, old boy,\" he said. \"The way things have been I'd assumed you were dead.\"</p>\n<p>\"It's nice to see you too, Dark. No need to be snide.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, but I feel there is, my good man. You see, I give you and Marshall all the rope you need, and it seems you've made a noose, put it around your own necks, and are ready to jump off the bloody chair with it. You're letting these bastards run circles around you, and you're ignoring it because everything is all right at the club. Just because the fire hasn't reached the back yard yet doesn't mean it's not still on the way.\u201d He hissed, pulling deeply on his cigar and glaring.</p>\n<p>\"I understand that Dark, we've just been forced to move a little slower because of the publicity. I have a team-\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, bugger your team. Who do you have, Finnegan and that twat Logan on it? It is, isn't it? Those two wastes of tissue aren't worth the air they breathe. I've got a ten-man staging now, and I'm putting Bobby on this.\"</p>\n<p>\"Bobby?\" Carter almost gasped, eyes wide. \"Isn't that a little\u2026 much? I mean, think of the Thanksgiving incident, I'm not sure if he's comp-\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh sod off, you twit, Bobby's on this now, and I want your fat fingers out of it. A fox girl who can shape-shift into any desire or dalliance is running around free, and you've sat. A woman who can cause or end any sickness is strutting about like a goddamn starlet, and you've twiddled your thumbs. You begged me to be here, Carter, your silence screamed to me again, and I'm going to handle things for you.\"</p>\n<p>\"Dark, goddammit, enough wi-\"</p>\n<p>Dark smiled then, and Carter didn't feel nervous or angry anymore. He was afraid. That was a smile of a man who knew too much about you, who was fumbling your dirty secrets about in his dirty head. Dark slid closer, his cold hand pulling Carter down to look him in the eye, close enough to kiss.</p>\n<p>\"You called me before, Carter, and I fixed things then too. I've always done right by you, dearie, even if I am a bit\u2026 gruff. So tell me, sweetheart, do you have something to say?\"</p>\n<p>\"\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"I asked if you had any opinion to express, Carter.\"</p>\n<p>\"\u2026 none at all, Mister Dark.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's a good lad.\" Dark released him then, patting his chest. \"Have the girls draw a bath for me, I need a cup of coffee and I have to piss.\" He steamed away in a haze of smoke, throwing the lit cigar at a staff member who he felt was moving too slowly. Carter watched, breathing slowly with effort. Now, win, lose or draw, he'd been benched. Dark was calling the shots now, he'd been pushed aside, like a child who'd been playing in the kitchen. There was no telling what Dark would do now\u2026 there was so much to collect.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"This is Kramer.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hey, sweetie. Are you still at the store?\"</p>\n<p>\"I am going to punch you in the throat. No, I'm on the way back.\"</p>\n<p>\"Can you get me a burger and a cup of coffee? The machine at the hotel doesn't have shit in it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Harken, are you drunk?\"</p>\n<p>\"No, no, no\u2026 well, maybe, why, do I sound drunk? I was drunk last night I think, does that count?\"</p>\n<p>\"Damn it Harken, you need to be lucid.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh come on, I'm as lucid as I ever am. You were gone for two days, what am I supposed to do to keep amused? A man can only masturbate so much.\"</p>\n<p>\"Sweet lord, Harken, sober the hell up fast. If you're like this when I get there, I'm getting a transfer. After I beat you senseless.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh stop\u2026 get me food, please? Please? No booze for the rest of the week, I swear.\"</p>\n<p>\"It's Saturday, Harken.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh\u2026 well, for a while then, OK? I'm really\u2026 Kramer, I need to go.\"</p>\n<p>\"What? What the hell is going on?\"</p>\n<p>\"There's a fat man with no shirt yelling in the parking lot, and he said my name.\"</p>\n<p>\"Harken, wh-\"</p>\n<p>He hung up without looking at the phone, eyes glued to the fat man on the ground floor. The hotel was a big, cheap horseshoe-shaped building on four levels. He'd gone to the third floor on the opposite side to hunt for snacks (and, ideally, medication for his throbbing head), and had an excellent view of his hotel room on the ground floor. The big man with no shirt was standing in front of the door to Harken and Kramer's hotel room. Harken leaned on the railing, squinting in the sun and watching with more amusement then fear.</p>\n<p>The big man hammered at the door, then stepped back. He was rather fat, long hair, scraggly beard\u2026 he looked like he'd had a rough go at life\u2026 missing three fingers on his left hand, too. Something about him rang a bell, somewhere. The fat man laughed, then yelled in a strained voice.</p>\n<p>\"Wakey Wakey, Harken! Mr. Dark sends his love!\"</p>\n<p>Mr. Dark? As in MC &amp; D? As in the people-</p>\n<p>Why would this slob know about th-</p>\n<p>Missing three fingers.</p>\n<p>Seemed unstable.</p>\n<p>Boomer.</p>\n<p>FUCK.</p>\n<p>Harken tried to take cover, but the exposed walkways offered nothing for protection. The fat man pressed a small device in his hand, and the entire left side of the hotel vanished in a oily black explosion. The walkway, held up by little more then rusty bolts and hope, dropped with a shrieking crash, taking Harken with it. He screamed, trying to find something soft to hit in the kaleidoscope of concrete and metal. He failed, crashing to the ground flat, most likely cracking several ribs, plus a few other things he would have preferred uncracked.</p>\n<p>He lay there, the wind knocked out of him, groaning and slowly trying to turn over. He didn't have to, as a meaty hand grabbed and hauled him up like a side of beef. He was suddenly looking into Boomer's sweaty, giggling face as he gripped Harken's now-bloody shirt. Boomer smiled and giggled more, then smashed his thick, stupid skull into Harken's face. It was like being hit by a car.</p>\n<p>\"Huh. I knew you'd be here, Harken, I knew it. Mister Dark never tells me wrong, Harken. Do you feel bad, Harken? You look bad, Harken. Huh.\"</p>\n<p>Harken was working on something witty when Boomer's fleshy fist smashed into his cheekbone. He moaned, feeling his eye already starting to swell, ears still ringing from the blast. Boomer slapped him twice. Each hit was like getting hit with a cutting board wrapped in a thin layer of padding.</p>\n<p>\"Mister Dark wants me to tell you to stop it, Harken. He says that you're being too mean and need to stop it, Harken. You got lucky, but if you keep it up he's gonna kill you dirty and slow, Harken. Huh. Heh. He's so mad at you, Harken. I think I'll kill you, Harken, and make Mister Dark happy with me. OK?\"</p>\n<p>Boomer followed up this with another fist to his face, then his throat, making Harken gasp and croak, trying to wheeze down breath. Over the ringing in his ears was an even more annoying and lovely sound\u2026 sirens. Boomer heard them too, swearing breathlessly as he pounded out a few more meaty hits, finally spitting in his face and knocking his head on the blacktop.</p>\n<p>\"You have a good day, Harken. Huh. Be seeing you later.\"</p>\n<p>He rose and ran off, leaving Harken pounded and bloody on the ground. It seemed like hours later, but finally someone came and started fussing over him. He could feel the heat from the burning hotel, the throbbing of his own bruised and smashed flesh. Not just beaten, no, but beaten by that giggling retard Boomer. He was almost unsure what hurt more, his ego or his body.</p>\n<p>Someone he couldn't see washed his face, swabbing away blood and grime.</p>\n<p>\"What the hell happened?\"</p>\n<p>Harken smiled painfully, trying to laugh through pulped ribs.</p>\n<p>\"Man, I just got here myself.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Kramer drove too fast, looking in the rear-view mirror every few minutes. Harken looked like a man who'd rode inside a cement mixer full of gravel. He moaned occasionally, turning over in his deep, drugged sleep.</p>\n<p>She'd seen the explosion just as she pulled off the freeway and realized something had gone wrong. Getting to the hotel wasn't hard: she'd fought the urge to speed there and proceeded to the site at a normal pace. Upon seeing the flashing lights, she'd driven on past. Kramer had parked in an alleyway a mile up the road, waited for more people to respond, readied her FBI credentials and twisted her face to match. After a reasonable delay, she'd threaded her way in, drifting to the ambulances with random flash of ID here and there.</p>\n<p>Getting Harken out had been more difficult. She'd been forced to create a distraction. Just a little disconnected heart monitor in another ambulance, enough to make the focus shift. She'd piggy-backed him out through the still-smoking rubble, tossing him into the back seat of her car with as much grace as she could muster.</p>\n<p>No way Harken could go to a civvie hospital. Grims was already in the wind, the last thing they needed was another Agent in public hands. Site 46 was close, and had full medical facilities: a bit far, but Harken was tough as a cockroach (despite his near-constant whining). He turned over with a groan, waving a hand feebly. \u201cJesus, I feel like ass.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"You don't look much better.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm hurt\u2026 aren't you obligated\u2026 to be nice\u2026 to me?\"</p>\n<p>\"No.\"</p>\n<p>Harken hissed in pain and pressed a hand to his forehead \"\u2026it was that\u2026 tubby bitch\u2026 Boomer\u2026 Dark's private\u2026 dog. Oooh, shit\u2026\" Harken rolled over and vomited. There were flecks of blood in it. \"He blew the room\u2026 moron\u2026 thought I\u2026 was in it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Shut up. We'll be on-site soon.\"</p>\n<p>\"\u2026hey, Kramer?\"</p>\n<p>\"\u2026yeah?\"</p>\n<p>\"How about\u2026 we leave the\u2026 rich boys\u2026 alone\u2026 for a bit? Go\u2026 fuck around\u2026 with the Hand\u2026 or the Insurgency\u2026 or some shit?\"</p>\n<p>\"Before or after we carve up Boomer like a flabby ham?\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh.\" Harken's blood-flecked lips curved up into a feral grin. \"After\u2026 obviously.\"</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/discovered-attack\">Discovered Attack</a>\" by DrClef, Dr Gears, and eric_h, from the <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Inelegant, yes, but the idea of Harken burning or splattering in his bed was enough to warm even Mr. Dark's pinched heart.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nCarter was waiting on the tarmac when Dark's jet landed. Various attendants, along with the New York club director were ranked behind him, every one of them with the same strained, nervous smile. Nothing good ever came from Mr. Dark visiting the States. It immediately put him in poor humor at the best of times, and with things as they were right now\u2026\n\n\n\nCarter repressed a shiver as the door slowly opened. Two tiny Asian attendants (identical female twins) scrambled out, carrying a cigar case and a opened umbrella. Next was Dark's longest-running secretary Cheryl, looking harried but still hard as a iron wrecking ball.\n\n\n\nAnd then the puppeteer himself, Mr. Dark, elegantly shabby, like a bitter old owl, snapping at everyone in reach, hitting his attendants with the tip of his cane when they fell so much as a step behind. Staff swarmed to the jet to get his voluminous luggage as Dark snatched up a cigar, the attendant ready with the match almost before he had it in his mouth. He turned, and caught sight of Carter standing at attention. He turned and faced him, a thick cloud of smoke pouring slowly from his nostrils. Carter stiffened, swallowing thickly. \n\n\n\nOh shit, here we go.\n\n\n\nDark crossed in a haze of smoke. Behind him, an unlucky porter dropped a heavy steamer trunk of luggage with a loud crash. \"Fire him,\" Dark said, without breaking stride. Carter felt some of the tension leave him. Dark was in a good mood: the last man to damage one of his possessions had been shot in the head.\n\n\n\nAll too soon he was there, glaring up at Carter, the thick and oddly spicy smell of his cigars curling around him like strangling hands. \"Well, so good to see you, old boy,\" he said. \"The way things have been I'd assumed you were dead.\"\n\n\n\n\"It's nice to see you too, Dark. No need to be snide.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, but I feel there is, my good man. You see, I give you and Marshall all the rope you need, and it seems you've made a noose, put it around your own necks, and are ready to jump off the bloody chair with it. You're letting these bastards run circles around you, and you're ignoring it because everything is all right at the club. Just because the fire hasn't reached the back yard yet doesn't mean it's not still on the way.\u201d He hissed, pulling deeply on his cigar and glaring.\n\n\n\n\"I understand that Dark, we've just been forced to move a little slower because of the publicity. I have a team-\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, bugger your team. Who do you have, Finnegan and that twat Logan on it? It is, isn't it? Those two wastes of tissue aren't worth the air they breathe. I've got a ten-man staging now, and I'm putting Bobby on this.\"\n\n\n\n\"Bobby?\" Carter almost gasped, eyes wide. \"Isn't that a little\u2026 much? I mean, think of the Thanksgiving incident, I'm not sure if he's comp-\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh sod off, you twit, Bobby's on this now, and I want your fat fingers out of it. A fox girl who can shape-shift into any desire or dalliance is running around free, and you've sat. A woman who can cause or end any sickness is strutting about like a goddamn starlet, and you've twiddled your thumbs. You begged me to be here, Carter, your silence screamed to me again, and I'm going to handle things for you.\"\n\n\n\n\"Dark, goddammit, enough wi-\"\n\n\n\nDark smiled then, and Carter didn't feel nervous or angry anymore. He was afraid. That was a smile of a man who knew too much about you, who was fumbling your dirty secrets about in his dirty head. Dark slid closer, his cold hand pulling Carter down to look him in the eye, close enough to kiss.\n\n\n\n\"You called me before, Carter, and I fixed things then too. I've always done right by you, dearie, even if I am a bit\u2026 gruff. So tell me, sweetheart, do you have something to say?\"\n\n\n\n\"\u2026\"\n\n\n\n\"I asked if you had any opinion to express, Carter.\"\n\n\n\n\"\u2026 none at all, Mister Dark.\"\n\n\n\n\"That's a good lad.\" Dark released him then, patting his chest. \"Have the girls draw a bath for me, I need a cup of coffee and I have to piss.\" He steamed away in a haze of smoke, throwing the lit cigar at a staff member who he felt was moving too slowly. Carter watched, breathing slowly with effort. Now, win, lose or draw, he'd been benched. Dark was calling the shots now, he'd been pushed aside, like a child who'd been playing in the kitchen. There was no telling what Dark would do now\u2026 there was so much to collect.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n\"This is Kramer.\"\n\n\n\n\"Hey, sweetie. Are you still at the store?\"\n\n\n\n\"I am going to punch you in the throat. No, I'm on the way back.\"\n\n\n\n\"Can you get me a burger and a cup of coffee? The machine at the hotel doesn't have shit in it.\"\n\n\n\n\"Harken, are you drunk?\"\n\n\n\n\"No, no, no\u2026 well, maybe, why, do I sound drunk? I was drunk last night I think, does that count?\"\n\n\n\n\"Damn it Harken, you need to be lucid.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh come on, I'm as lucid as I ever am. You were gone for two days, what am I supposed to do to keep amused? A man can only masturbate so much.\"\n\n\n\n\"Sweet lord, Harken, sober the hell up fast. If you're like this when I get there, I'm getting a transfer. After I beat you senseless.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh stop\u2026 get me food, please? Please? No booze for the rest of the week, I swear.\"\n\n\n\n\"It's Saturday, Harken.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh\u2026 well, for a while then, OK? I'm really\u2026 Kramer, I need to go.\"\n\n\n\n\"What? What the hell is going on?\"\n\n\n\n\"There's a fat man with no shirt yelling in the parking lot, and he said my name.\"\n\n\n\n\"Harken, wh-\"\n\n\n\nHe hung up without looking at the phone, eyes glued to the fat man on the ground floor. The hotel was a big, cheap horseshoe-shaped building on four levels. He'd gone to the third floor on the opposite side to hunt for snacks (and, ideally, medication for his throbbing head), and had an excellent view of his hotel room on the ground floor. The big man with no shirt was standing in front of the door to Harken and Kramer's hotel room. Harken leaned on the railing, squinting in the sun and watching with more amusement then fear.\n\n\n\nThe big man hammered at the door, then stepped back. He was rather fat, long hair, scraggly beard\u2026 he looked like he'd had a rough go at life\u2026 missing three fingers on his left hand, too. Something about him rang a bell, somewhere. The fat man laughed, then yelled in a strained voice.\n\n\n\n\"Wakey Wakey, Harken! Mr. Dark sends his love!\"\n\n\n\nMr. Dark? As in MC & D? As in the people-\n\n\n\nWhy would this slob know about th-\n\n\n\nMissing three fingers.\n\n\n\nSeemed unstable.\n\n\n\nBoomer.\n\n\n\nFUCK.\n\n\n\nHarken tried to take cover, but the exposed walkways offered nothing for protection. The fat man pressed a small device in his hand, and the entire left side of the hotel vanished in a oily black explosion. The walkway, held up by little more then rusty bolts and hope, dropped with a shrieking crash, taking Harken with it. He screamed, trying to find something soft to hit in the kaleidoscope of concrete and metal. He failed, crashing to the ground flat, most likely cracking several ribs, plus a few other things he would have preferred uncracked.\n\n\n\nHe lay there, the wind knocked out of him, groaning and slowly trying to turn over. He didn't have to, as a meaty hand grabbed and hauled him up like a side of beef. He was suddenly looking into Boomer's sweaty, giggling face as he gripped Harken's now-bloody shirt. Boomer smiled and giggled more, then smashed his thick, stupid skull into Harken's face. It was like being hit by a car.\n\n\n\n\"Huh. I knew you'd be here, Harken, I knew it. Mister Dark never tells me wrong, Harken. Do you feel bad, Harken? You look bad, Harken. Huh.\"\n\n\n\nHarken was working on something witty when Boomer's fleshy fist smashed into his cheekbone. He moaned, feeling his eye already starting to swell, ears still ringing from the blast. Boomer slapped him twice. Each hit was like getting hit with a cutting board wrapped in a thin layer of padding.\n\n\n\n\"Mister Dark wants me to tell you to stop it, Harken. He says that you're being too mean and need to stop it, Harken. You got lucky, but if you keep it up he's gonna kill you dirty and slow, Harken. Huh. Heh. He's so mad at you, Harken. I think I'll kill you, Harken, and make Mister Dark happy with me. OK?\"\n\n\n\nBoomer followed up this with another fist to his face, then his throat, making Harken gasp and croak, trying to wheeze down breath. Over the ringing in his ears was an even more annoying and lovely sound\u2026 sirens. Boomer heard them too, swearing breathlessly as he pounded out a few more meaty hits, finally spitting in his face and knocking his head on the blacktop.\n\n\n\n\"You have a good day, Harken. Huh. Be seeing you later.\"\n\n\n\nHe rose and ran off, leaving Harken pounded and bloody on the ground. It seemed like hours later, but finally someone came and started fussing over him. He could feel the heat from the burning hotel, the throbbing of his own bruised and smashed flesh. Not just beaten, no, but beaten by that giggling retard Boomer. He was almost unsure what hurt more, his ego or his body.\n\n\n\nSomeone he couldn't see washed his face, swabbing away blood and grime.\n\n\n\n\"What the hell happened?\"\n\n\n\nHarken smiled painfully, trying to laugh through pulped ribs.\n\n\n\n\"Man, I just got here myself.\"\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nKramer drove too fast, looking in the rear-view mirror every few minutes. Harken looked like a man who'd rode inside a cement mixer full of gravel. He moaned occasionally, turning over in his deep, drugged sleep.\n\n\n\nShe'd seen the explosion just as she pulled off the freeway and realized something had gone wrong. Getting to the hotel wasn't hard: she'd fought the urge to speed there and proceeded to the site at a normal pace. Upon seeing the flashing lights, she'd driven on past. Kramer had parked in an alleyway a mile up the road, waited for more people to respond, readied her FBI credentials and twisted her face to match. After a reasonable delay, she'd threaded her way in, drifting to the ambulances with random flash of ID here and there.\n\n\n\nGetting Harken out had been more difficult. She'd been forced to create a distraction. Just a little disconnected heart monitor in another ambulance, enough to make the focus shift. She'd piggy-backed him out through the still-smoking rubble, tossing him into the back seat of her car with as much grace as she could muster.\n\n\n\nNo way Harken could go to a civvie hospital. Grims was already in the wind, the last thing they needed was another Agent in public hands. Site 46 was close, and had full medical facilities: a bit far, but Harken was tough as a cockroach (despite his near-constant whining). He turned over with a groan, waving a hand feebly. \u201cJesus, I feel like ass.\u201d\n\n\n\n\"You don't look much better.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm hurt\u2026 aren't you obligated\u2026 to be nice\u2026 to me?\"\n\n\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\n\nHarken hissed in pain and pressed a hand to his forehead \"\u2026it was that\u2026 tubby bitch\u2026 Boomer\u2026 Dark's private\u2026 dog. Oooh, shit\u2026\" Harken rolled over and vomited. There were flecks of blood in it. \"He blew the room\u2026 moron\u2026 thought I\u2026 was in it.\"\n\n\n\n\"Shut up. We'll be on-site soon.\"\n\n\n\n\"\u2026hey, Kramer?\"\n\n\n\n\"\u2026yeah?\"\n\n\n\n\"How about\u2026 we leave the\u2026 rich boys\u2026 alone\u2026 for a bit? Go\u2026 fuck around\u2026 with the Hand\u2026 or the Insurgency\u2026 or some shit?\"\n\n\n\n\"Before or after we carve up Boomer like a flabby ham?\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh.\" Harken's blood-flecked lips curved up into a feral grin. \"After\u2026 obviously.\"\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>\n\n|author=DrClef, Dr Gears, and eric_h]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "licensing-guide", "licensing-master-list"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "co-authored", "game-day", "marshall-carter-and-dark", "tale"], "title": "Discovered Attack - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/discovered-attack", "year": 2011}, "discussion": {"created_at": "2011-02-17T00:41:00", "creator": "Gargus", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Gargus", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/gargus", "comment": "Note: I'm doing this without Crow's permission on the will of the chat.

Though he insists that I have authority over the village, the fact remains that he is in command of the men with weapons while the rest of us are defenseless. Until Captain Trubaiev conclusively shows that he is no threat, I will continue to withold my trust of him. He has kept a very large secret from us before, after all.</p>\n<p>We have to begin considering how to ration our supplies. We are fortunate that this happened in autumn, allowing us to work with [\u2026]</p>\n<p>[ILLEGIBLE MATERIAL FOLLOWED BY A MINIMUM OF EIGHT DESTROYED PAGES]</p>\n<p>[\u2026] brutal than that were the actions of the Captain when he learned of it. I would not call it a trial. Only the Captain spoke, listing off every one of the soldier's faults. He was then left tied in the central square for four hours until the Captain returned with the rest of his men and personally executed him with his own sidearm. His words will never leave me:</p>\n<p>\"Stand up! Even if you've never lived like a man, at least die like one! Stand up and look me in the eyes!\"</p>\n<p>Could such a ruthless man be trusted to protect the village? Even if it was for the Jewish girl, it may not stop with one death. What will happen if one of us commits a crime against one of the soldiers? Will he demand that they be disposed of in the same way? With all of the armed men under his control, we could do [\u2026]</p>\n<p>[BETWEEN TEN AND THIRTEEN DAMAGED OR ILLEGIBLE PAGES]</p>\n<p>[\u2026] dare call me the tyrant! Do they even understand that this was for their own well being? Without my militia, only the Captain wields true power. And, while we continue to consolidate our position, we have to follow the same example that the Captain had made of that traitor of his. It is the only way that we can avoid arousing his suspicion.</p>\n<p>And now people are leaving with the Uzbek. The punk and the hippies won't be missed. We can even make do without a few of the families. But, with no engineer, we won't be able to keep the generator [\u2026]</p>\n<p>[FOLLOWING PAGE]</p>\n<p>[\u2026] is well.

The boy probably won't survive if the militia did what they said they did to him. And the Uzbek is too old to cause any further trouble.

Day after day, week after week, they had come to him. Talking to him. Telling him their lies, trying to see where he broke. They'd never realized how much they had told him instead.

He'd had it in place for quite some time. Plans, plots, and schemes, all ready to go, when everything was right. In the end, all it took to spark it off was a simple cold. The old lady had already been quite weak, refusing to indulge in treatments like the others. An illness introduced into her system by a well-placed cough, and she passed away in her sleep. The numbers above and below her had came to him and offered him her numbers. He accepted, with a show of reluctance. Those who are shown to desire power are those least likely to be trusted with it.</p>\n<p>And now O5-4 sat in his office. He had been given his mark of office. A foot-long length of bone, polished smooth. His name had been erased, not just from Foundation databanks, but from the minds of all who had known him. He was sure the other numbers knew his name, but soon enough, they wouldn't matter. He let his fingers drift towards the keyboard before him, and a half smile rose to his lips. Alone, with no one watching, he still felt the need to say, well, something. For posterity. \"I feel like a super villain. Like Lex Luthor, or Adrian Veidt. Heh. 'Do it, Dr. Bright? I did it 35 minutes ago.'\" As good a set of words as any.</p>\n<p>Four touched a series of buttons, setting into motion the events that would place the entirety of the Foundation into his hands. Then he sat back and waited. Fifteen minutes, and everything would be his.</p>\n<h1 id=\"toc0\"><span>13</span></h1>\n<p>Thirteen was easiest. Mainly because O5-13 didn't really exist. Oh, the Senior Staff were told he did. There were memos, handed down by 'O5-13,' but it was just one more lie. Thirteen's vote was rotated to the other O5's, moving up a step any time there was a tie vote and the tie breaker was needed. But there was a power there. Knowledge, that only those who held Thirteen's vote could access. A simple (actually quite complex) computer virus snuck past the Overseers' firewalls, and bestowed the power of Thirteen to Four. Easy as that.</p>\n<h1 id=\"toc1\"><span>12</span></h1>\n<p>A large African man sat in his chair, behind an expensive desk. The room he used as his office could also quite easily be described as 'expensive.' The man himself could be described the same. Silk tie. Gold cufflinks. Armani suit. Shoes made from the skin of a very rare reptile. He wore dark wrap-around glasses, smoked glass framed in ivory, perhaps to hide his eyes, perhaps to keep him from looking too closely at the things he had to. Although he had once borne another name, these days he was known to one and all as O5-12. He was the accountant for the Overseer council, making sure the numbers added up, everywhere.</p>\n<p>His assistant entered the office on schedule. Everything Twelve did was on schedule. From the moment he woke up, to the moment he went to sleep, and perhaps even his dreams, followed a precise, practical order. To do things otherwise invited chaos, and with chaos came death. The assistant walked calmly to the drink cabinet, opening it as he had done every day for years. Somewhere in his head, things were turning. A thing had been planted in his head, before he became Twelve's right-hand man. And now, this thing made him pick a different bottle than the one he normally did.</p>\n<p>The glass was poured, and it looked like whiskey. It even smelled like whiskey. When the brainwashed assistant dropped an ice cube in it, it even bubbled a little, like whiskey. But, when O5-12 raised it to his lips and gulped it down, it didn't act like whiskey. Contact with the soft, wet flesh of his tongue and throat resulted in a chemical reaction. Instead of the sweet soothing burn of alcohol, Twelve was rewarded with the swift, horrible burn of acid.</p>\n<p>He was dead before the glass left his lips.</p>\n<h1 id=\"toc2\"><span>11</span></h1>\n<p>The two men sat across from each other, separated only by a chessboard. It was an old board, but they were old men. O5-11 was a pleasant enough looking Caucasian gentlemen, one of those old men who sit on their porch and offer candy to little children. Not the creepy kind. Eleven fiddled with a bracelet made from human teeth as he considered both the board, and his opponent.</p>\n<p>\"It's still your move, 'Leven,\" Agent Alto Clef teased his superior. Maybe the Devil, maybe a reality bender, one thing could be said for certain: Clef enjoyed these monthly games with Eleven. When his phone beeped to alert him to an incoming text, he almost ignored it. Almost. But he'd expected this. Sure enough, the text merely read 'Now.'</p>\n<p>\"Check.\"</p>\n<p>\"Where? You don't have check anywhere!\" O5-11 leaned across the chessboard, searching for his opponent's move, his hands touching both sides of the board.</p>\n<p>A sad smile on his face, Clef spoke. \"There.\" He calmly tipped over his own king, and 300 amps of electricity charged into Eleven's body, frying his brain to a crisp.</p>\n<p>\"Checkmate.\"</p>\n<h1 id=\"toc3\"><span>10</span></h1>\n<p>O5-10 didn't notice when the air conditioning kicked on. It was just another distraction from the endless paperwork that filled her life these days. She was a strong, capable woman, a brunette, dressed in a functional long skirt and jacket. Every five minutes she'd raise her hand to the necklace around her throat, a carved marble eyeball, dangling to stare at her paperwork with the same disgust she felt for it.</p>\n<p>Her first indication that anything was wrong was when she realized she'd read the same page 4 times without comprehending it. By then it was too late. She could hear the clicking and hissing sounds being made by her body. Her hand refused to let go of the paper. Her hand refused to let go of the paper. Her hand refused to let go. Her hand refused. Her hand. Her.</p>\n<h1 id=\"toc4\"><span>9</span></h1>\n<p>He always claimed he was the unluckiest O5. The only one who didn't get to be a world-traveling jetsetter. Oh no. Nine was stuck deep in the middle of the ocean. Sure, he could travel to any of the water Sites, all couple dozen of them, but most of the time, he ended up here, deep beneath the sea, where no natural light could find its way. He was a pale man, small, always looking lost in the suits he tried to make look good. A bone-handled knife rested in his hands at this moment in time, as he stared into the abyss. It would have been poetic to say something gazed back, but the only thing outside the window in his office was water, lots and lots of water.</p>\n<p>Several seconds later, the only thing inside his office was lots and lots of water. Between the water in his lungs, and the pressure so deep, O5-9 was the unluckiest O5.</p>\n<h1 id=\"toc5\"><span>8</span></h1>\n<p>A shower could never make her feel clean. No matter how many times she washed, she could still feel those things crawling across her skin, could still see all the people she'd condemned to death. Eight was not a pretty woman. Despite being one of a handful of all-powerful Overseers, she'd never gotten any work done, no surgery to fix her sloped forehead, her craggy brow, no lap band to cut back on her weight. Somehow, despite having no appetite, she'd still gained weight. Even naked under the water, she still wore a braided ring of sinew on her left ring finger.</p>\n<p>She turned the water up hotter, trying to blast away the horrible memories, boil them off. The heat felt very nice. Until there was nothing but heat. She didn't even manage a scream when her flesh boiled away. In fact, she may have smiled, because the memories, at last, were gone.</p>\n<h1 id=\"toc6\"><span>7</span></h1>\n<p>\"I'm sorry, driver, I don't think I've seen you before. What did you say your name was?\" Seven asked absently, fiddling with the ivory chopstick in her hair.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, it's Rodney. But most people call me Dr. Gerald.\"</p>\n<h1 id=\"toc7\"><span>6</span></h1>\n<p>He had been an Agent, once upon a time. When he worked the field, they called him Cowboy. People still remembered the agent, even if no one knew he was now the Overseer known as Six. He had been the best.</p>\n<p>And now, he was an old man. Dressed as always in an immaculate white suit, his long grey hair pulled back in a ponytail, his trademark Stetson tilted at an angle on his head. Between his gnarled old hands he held a white cane, the handle carved into the shape of a howling wolf. At his back were his two trusted bodyguards, Thompson and Black. They were almost as good as him. One day, they'd be better. When they were, well, one of them could take his number, and he could retire. Maybe spend some time with his granddaughter.</p>\n<p>He didn't look back when Black got a text. He never knew that O5-4 had once been Agent Black's personal physician. Or, if he had known, it wouldn't have mattered. He did, however, feel it when Black drew his guns. He began to turn, but, no, too slow. As he fell to the floor, he noticed Thompson falling beside him. But the hole in the back of his head prevented him from noticing any more.</p>\n<h1 id=\"toc8\"><span>5</span></h1>\n<p>\"It's an emergency, sir! We have to get you out of here!\" The security guard hurried O5-5 and his secretary into the nearest airlock, and slammed the door shut behind the three of them. The guard leaned against the door, panting. \"Keter, sir. It sounds bad.\" The secretary sniffed, but then, she always had pneumonia, or some other sinus problem.</p>\n<p>O5-5 was nondescript. He dressed nice, but not well. His hair was\u2026 enh. His face was\u2026 blah. He didn't stand out. In fact, the only thing that was noticeable about him was the leather shoes. A nice, tanned leather. His secretary was an African-American woman, about 51 years old, quiet, with a rather large nose. She had always been his emergency escape, even if she didn't know it.</p>\n<p>As the room proceeded to move upwards, the guard frowned, turning to look at the two of them. \"Do either of you hear a hissing sound?\"</p>\n<p>The gas was fast-acting, invisible, unscented. It poured out of 108's nose at a furious pace, killing them all as they rode to safety.</p>\n<h1 id=\"toc9\"><span>3</span></h1>\n<p>\"Well hey guys, how are you today? It's fantastic to see you!\" Three looked like a teenage boy, late teens, blond hair down to his collar, jean jacket filled with patches, geek-style glasses. O5-3 never let himself be seen in person, or, at least, not for many years. He always showed up on a monitor, broadcasting from a white room, a fancy desk and old-fashioned computer beside him. While he always had a prop or two at hand, it was never anything real. In fact, O5-3 wasn't real. He'd died, decades ago, plugged into a prototype computer he'd invented. He just didn't go away.</p>\n<p>The Overseer council took a vote, and decided they didn't care. He was still their best coder. He could still do the job. So, they set his bone earring on the mainframe, installed some safety programs, and let him work.</p>\n<p>An electromagnetic pulse set off inside the hardware that carried him removed him from this world at last.</p>\n<h1 id=\"toc10\"><span>2</span></h1>\n<p>60\u00a0km west of Astrakhan, a garden was in bloom. O5-2 took great pride in her garden. Of course, she was cheating, a little. She didn't mind. Once you get old enough, you don't mind using a few cheat codes to get things done. Two was the type of woman you pictured when you heard the word 'Grandma.' She always had a blonde shawl on, no matter the weather, and usually a pair of gardening gloves. She had a fantastic gardening hat a friend had made for her, pushed down tightly on her grey curls.</p>\n<p>Her helper was an old friend, a man old well before his time, and maybe after it as well. He glanced up, a slight frown on his face, and pointed, looking uncomfortable. He wasn't used to this much attention on him.</p>\n<p>Two had the time to look up and smile at the Russian satellite that was screaming down through the sky at her. She could have moved. She could have run. She noticed the 'rogue' satellite too early, and she could have made it to the spring, saved herself. But she didn't.</p>\n<p>If anyone had been around to hear her last words, they might have been confused that what she chose to say was \"It's about time.\"</p>\n<h1 id=\"toc11\"><span>1</span></h1>\n<p>And One. The first. Once upon a time, he had been known as the Administrator. All the power in the Foundation had been his. But he didn't trust himself. He knew that absolute power corrupts absolutely. So, he parceled off his power. Handed out badges of responsibility. Numbered them, and made sure they could balance each other. Set up a system, so that if one died, the authority, the votes, were passed to another, so the balance would never be uneven for long.</p>\n<p>And then he retreated from the world. Buried himself down deep, with only electronic means to keep him in touch with the outside. Which means that O5-1, still looking like a 13-year-old boy, still clad in the rags and bones that hadn't been used to mark the other 12, was completely alone. When his systems shut down, he didn't panic. When the liquid concrete began seeping out of the air vents, he didn't panic. He just lay down, and accepted it. After all, he'd been expecting it.</p>\n<h1 id=\"toc12\"><span>4</span></h1>\n<p>O5-4 stared at the screen before him, as the 13 lights shifted, back and forth, here and there. One dies a little ahead of another, so the vote goes to her, then she dies, so vote travels here\u2026 until, finally, at last, the votes were all his. The power was all his. The Foundation was all his.</p>\n<p>Dr. Everett Mann, the Administrator, allowed himself one appreciative cackle. Just one. No sense going all maniacal about it. Besides, he had so much work to do. His fingers flew across the keyboards, as he prepared to change everything. As he typed, he muttered to himself.</p>\n<p>\"Good evening, Doctor. No, no, don't stand up\u2026\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"/annon\">...</a></p>\n</div></body></html>", "raw_source": "\n\t[[>]]\n\n[[module Rate]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd so, at last, it had come to this. Day after day, week after week, they had come to him. Talking to him. Telling him their lies, trying to see where he broke. They'd never realized how much they had told him instead. When you hear enough lies, you get a feeling for the truth. You can see the shape of the truth, by how the lies outline it.\n\n\n\nHe had everything in place.

O5-2 took great pride in her garden. Of course, she was cheating, a little. She didn't mind. Once you get old enough, you don't mind using a few cheat codes to get things done. Two was the type of woman you pictured when you heard the word 'Grandma.' She always had a blonde shawl on, no matter the weather, and usually a pair of gardening gloves. She had a fantastic gardening hat a friend had made for her, pushed down tightly on her grey curls.\n\n\n\nHer helper was an old friend, a man old well before his time, and maybe after it as well. He glanced up, a slight frown on his face, and pointed, looking uncomfortable. He wasn't used to this much attention on him.\n\n\n\nTwo had the time to look up and smile at the Russian satellite that was screaming down through the sky at her. She could have moved. She could have run. She noticed the 'rogue' satellite too early, and she could have made it to the spring, saved herself. But she didn't.\n\n\n\nIf anyone had been around to hear her last words, they might have been confused that what she chose to say was \"It's about time.\"\n\n\n\n+ 1\n\n\n\nAnd One. The first. Once upon a time, he had been known as the Administrator. All the power in the Foundation had been his. But he didn't trust himself. He knew that absolute power corrupts absolutely. So, he parceled off his power. Handed out badges of responsibility.\u00a0\u00a0Numbered them, and made sure they could balance each other. Set up a system, so that if one died, the authority, the votes, were passed to another, so the balance would never be uneven for long.\n\n\n\nAnd then he retreated from the world. Buried himself down deep, with only electronic means to keep him in touch with the outside. Which means that O5-1, still looking like a 13-year-old boy, still clad in the rags and bones that hadn't been used to mark the other 12, was completely alone. When his systems shut down, he didn't panic. When the liquid concrete began seeping out of the air vents, he didn't panic. He just lay down, and accepted it. After all, he'd been expecting it.\n\n\n\n+ 4\n\n\n\nO5-4 stared at the screen before him, as the 13 lights shifted, back and forth, here and there. One dies a little ahead of another, so the vote goes to her, then she dies, so vote travels here... until, finally, at last, the votes were all his. The power was all his. The Foundation was all his.\n\n\n\nDr. Everett Mann, the Administrator, allowed himself one appreciative cackle. Just one. No sense going all maniacal about it. Besides, he had so much work to do. His fingers flew across the keyboards, as he prepared to change everything. As he typed, he muttered to himself.\n\n\n\n\"Good evening, Doctor. No, no, don't stand up...\"\n\n\n\n[[[annon |...]]]\n", "references": ["annon"], "tags": ["doctor-clef", "doctor-gerald", "doctor-mann", "featured", "tale", "the-administrator"], "title": "Ecce Perago - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ecceperago", "year": 2011}, "eldritch-application": {"created_at": "2011-03-27T23:06:00", "creator": "Gargus", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Gargus", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/gargus", "comment": "An idea I had the other day.

Or as hell, one of the two. He'd kicked and screamed to get here, and now he just wanted it to be over. Two days of computer and technology stuff, in a nice big hotel, with lots of food and drink. His girlfriend had been less than thrilled, to say the least, but he'd prevailed with a minimum of tears. It all seemed like such a good idea at the time. Now, he felt shell-shocked. Too many people, everything so expensive, rude and snide jerks everywhere, and the growing, acidic tension between him and his girlfriend was starting to come to a head.</p>\n<p>He'd managed to drag her down to look at cell phones, but he'd run into an ex-girlfriend running a seminar registration table. She'd sort of cornered him, immediately pouring out her heart, how sorry she was, how much she missed him. By the time he'd gotten away, his girlfriend was well gone, only the aura of her rage hanging behind. He searched, demoralized, but she hadn't even returned to the room. He'd had to narrowly dodge the Ex a couple more times, reminding himself easily of why he left her to begin with. At least their car was still in the lot.</p>\n<p>Slithering through the crush of people, he wormed out to the relative calm of the lobby. He just wanted to rest, to let the clock spin to the end of this nightmare, even if he knew it'd lose him position in the great argument to come. The elevators were packed tight, a hefty and unruly line pressed against them, and he sighed, looking around for stairs. He spotted a small, dingy set of elevator doors set against the far wall just as his Ex spotted him across the lobby. He dived for the call button like a drowning man.</p>\n<p>The doors hummed, his foot tapping in a panic. If she caught him in a enclosed space, things could go badly quickly. The door bonged, and the tarnished steel door slid half-way open before stopping with a jerk. He slipped in, just as his Ex cleared the crush of people, the door shuddering shut on her disappointed face. He sighed, leaning against the back wall, then wrinkled his nose at the sudden smell. He looked, and quickly recoiled from the wall. The metal booth was filthy, sticky with urine and something melted, the floor stained and scuffed, some mass of soft, filthy material making a small pile in the corner.</p>\n<p>The booth was small. Very small. Barely big enough for one, let alone two. He looked to the door, and had a sudden flutter of panic. There were no buttons. No up, no down, no numbers, no emergency stop. Nothing. He felt a click and a hum, the car starting to rattle its way up, the flutter of panic growing as he contemplated being trapped here, but lost it almost instantly as the car stopped again. This had to be some kind of service elevator or something, which went to every floor in sequence. He had no idea if such a thing existed, but for him, now, it did. He'd just get off, apologize, and hike to the room.</p>\n<p>For several seconds the door stayed closed, eating at his slim ledge of calm. Finally, one door shuddered a quarter of the way open, revealing a dark hall. He pressed hard, pushing through the slim gap just as someone emerged from the dark. He seemed tired, haggard, and totally ignored his half-stated apologies. The pale man shoved in the the elevator he'd just left, quickly disappearing behind the shivering door. As he watched the man leave, he saw no call buttons of any kind on the door frame. He sighed, looking around, the gloom illuminated by just a few bare bulbs strung along the ceiling. The walls, floor, everything seemed to be made of a dark, crumbling brick, slightly moist and\u2026</p>\n<p>Wait. What?</p>\n<p>He'd gone up, not down. This sure as hell looked like a basement room, with the damp bricks, the uneven floor, the walls chipped and missing bricks in places, the\u2026what the hell. The short hall ended in what looked like a \u201cT\u201d junction. The left side seemed to have a handrail, so that was probably stairs. There was a bulge in the brick on the left-hand wall, just before the junction, as if they'd bricked around a large pipe, and for some reason it scared the hell out of him. He started, nearly on tip-toe, sneaking silently down the dim hall. He reached the stairs without incident, no hisses or arms or anything leaping from the dark to tear him to bits, and grabbed the slightly pitted handrail. He was three steps up before he heard the chuff.</p>\n<p>It was the sound a sick dog makes. Phlegmy and echoing through a snout. He turned slightly, not wanting to at all but feeling compelled to do so. Opposite the stairs, down the other junction, a thing shivered. It was low and squat, about the size of a person laying down. It had four short, oozing legs, massive back eyes, and sawblade teeth. It looked like a partially-skinned possum, frizzy hair around large patched of black, rotten-looking muscle. It started to lurch up to the stairs, seeming to be in a great deal of pain, but still very fast. He flew up the creaking stairs, not realizing he was screaming for almost a half hour.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>He ran. Insanely, he ran, up and up and up, trying halls at random, finding locked doors, bare rooms full of teeth, pulpy floors with large patches of rot, all sending him back to the stairs with hoarse screams, always the thing just behind him, leaving a dripping trail of slime and blood. He beat at the walls of the stairwell, clawing, watching as the bricks bled just as much as his cracked fingernails. A hallway choked with lines that felt like tendon ended in a flat mass of hard jelly the color of a cataract. He ran, and ran, voice gone, only a drip of blood from shredded vocal cords, stumbling and crawling like a drunk.</p>\n<p>Lurching up, he found the ceiling of the stairwell, the stairs smashed against the wall as if the ceiling had suddenly slammed in against them. He turned silently in to the nearest hall, too numb to rejoice or despair, feeling the floor sag and wobble under his feet, glancing in a open doorway to see a massive mound of flesh that seemed to be absorbing smaller ones, barely noticing as a brick fell loose from the ceiling, clouting him on the back and letting loose a slow waterfall of pus from the now open gap. He stumbled, feet sludgy in the floor, half-swimming along to the vague light at the end of the hall.</p>\n<p>He looked up, focusing dim eyes on a window to life. Grass blew in a night breeze around a packed parking lot, a hotel lit up like a tower of salvation behind it, people walking to and from cars, laughing happily. He flailed, crawling, croaking bloody yelps as he reached, straining, fingers stretching as a flabby, oozing paw sank hard into his back, the flesh instantly turning black and flaking at the rotten touch. He screamed then, the ragged, broken howl of a deer with a wolf in its throat, the chuffing muzzle starting to search through the flabby bags and soggy tubes of its catch for sweetbreads.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The janitor sighed, edging up on the reeking mess. These goddamn kids, no respect at all, just wandering wherever they please. This says \u201cstaff only\u201d on the fucking door, yet look there. He scowled, looking down at the pile of bloody vomit and shit. Honestly, what the fucking hell? Still, not his business to deal with the punks, just clean up after them. He did so, swearing all the while, hoping whoever did this was having a fucking hell of a bad time. The janitor scowled at the now mostly clean floor, pushing his bucket along to the stupid service stairs. They really needed to put a fucking elevator down here, but who cares about the wants of one old man? He shook his head, hearing the sounds of pounding and screams far off, some wild party or another to clean up tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Fucking kids.</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/elevator\">Elevator</a>\" by Dr Gears, from the <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

He sighed, looking around, the gloom illuminated by just a few bare bulbs strung along the ceiling.\u00a0\u00a0The walls, floor, everything seemed to be made of a dark, crumbling brick, slightly moist and...\n\n\n\nWait.\u00a0\u00a0What?\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He'd gone up, not down.\u00a0\u00a0This sure as hell looked like a basement room, with the damp bricks, the uneven floor, the walls chipped and missing bricks in places, the...what the hell.\u00a0\u00a0The short hall ended in what looked like a \u201cT\u201d junction.\u00a0\u00a0The left side seemed to have a handrail, so that was probably stairs.\u00a0\u00a0There was a bulge in the brick on the left-hand wall, just before the junction, as if they'd bricked around a large pipe, and for some reason it scared the hell out of him.\u00a0\u00a0He started, nearly on tip-toe, sneaking silently down the dim hall.\u00a0\u00a0He reached the stairs without incident, no hisses or arms or anything leaping from the dark to tear him to bits, and grabbed the slightly pitted handrail.\u00a0\u00a0He was three steps up before he heard the chuff.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was the sound a sick dog makes.\u00a0\u00a0Phlegmy and echoing through a snout.\u00a0\u00a0He turned slightly, not wanting to at all but feeling compelled to do so.\u00a0\u00a0Opposite the stairs, down the other junction, a thing shivered.\u00a0\u00a0It was low and squat, about the size of a person laying down.\u00a0\u00a0It had four short, oozing legs, massive back eyes, and sawblade teeth.\u00a0\u00a0It looked like a partially-skinned possum, frizzy hair around large patched of black, rotten-looking muscle.\u00a0\u00a0It started to lurch up to the stairs, seeming to be in a great deal of pain, but still very fast.\u00a0\u00a0He flew up the creaking stairs, not realizing he was screaming for almost a half hour.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n\u00a0\tHe ran.\u00a0\u00a0Insanely, he ran, up and up and up, trying halls at random, finding locked doors, bare rooms full of teeth, pulpy floors with large patches of rot, all sending him back to the stairs with hoarse screams, always the thing just behind him, leaving a dripping trail of slime and

Still, there were other ways out.\n\n\n\n\"I've done my job.\"\u00a0\u00a0I could give less of a shit about how much they want to study me, I was getting out.\n\n\n\n\"Ah, yes, but you're an SCP object yourself.\"\n\n\n\n\"Boss, please.\" I placed a look of desperation on my face. Just biding my time.\n\n\n\n\"Listen, you've done us good, you'll get your own furnishings and cell with the best service.\" The man walked over to me as he spoke. Good. I placed my grip on my knife.\n\n\n\n\"Boss, I'm asking you from the bottom of my heart.\" I began to pull out my knife, ready to place it at his throat.\n\n\n\nI saw a flash of movement towards my thigh, followed by a sudden pain. I looked down to see a needle sticking in it. Quick guy. Quicker than me. I hadn't thought anyone was quicker.\n\n\n\nI stumbled and collapsed against the doorway.

Are we sure we're in the right place? How do we know these aren't just random people waiting for a ride or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>Agent Four grinned, his lean face masked by a massive set of binoculars. \u201cOh no, it's them. See the one with the stack of books wrapped in a belt? We've seen him before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"What do you suppose is in those books anyway?\"</p>\n<p>\"Not sure. But one of them we recovered was the complete works of Samuel Coleridge, including the full version of 'Kubla Khan.' All three hundred lines.\"</p>\n<p>\"Is that a big deal?\"</p>\n<p>Four sighed. \"Just keep your eye on the targets.\"</p>\n<p>Agent Grims squinted, shifting. He'd been staring down a scope roughly the size of a two-liter, attached to a high-powered, accurate, and very heavy rifle for nearly a hour now. He exhaled loudly, wiping his dark brow and re-fitting it to the eye cup. \u201cWhy are we on lookout? Why isn't the rest of the team moving in?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause we need to see what happens first, Grims. Otherwise I'd have you smoke the lot of them and go get a damn beer. They're not supposed to be here, and we just got the info from Scud yesterday. If this pans out, we can figure out what the hell the Serpent's Hand is suddenly on the move for the first time in a year. Now shut up and watch.\u201d</p>\n<p>Grims grumbled under his breath, finger twitching a bit on the trigger. He was sick and tired of being attached to this damn squad. Since the attack, everyone had been shuffled, teams expanded and re-manned, to allow for instant autonomy in case of another communication blackout. Or some such bullshit. All he knew is that he hated working with these damn spooks. At least on the MTF squads, he could joke around, these people-</p>\n<p>\u201cMovement\u2026 movement on the librarian\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Grims snapped to instantly, sighting in on the target. The man with the books had risen, moving from the sidewalk and down to a small side-alley. The other three people followed close behind, looking very nervous, checking up and down the street.</p>\n<p>\u201cFour, the guy in the blue shirt looks like he's on a phone\u2026 what sho-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cForget it, Smith already has an intercept\u2026\u201d Agent Four paused, touching his finger to the tiny earbud in his right ear. \u201c\u2026sounds like\u2026 someone's late. They had to change the meeting spot, because they'd been exposed too long\u2026 bah, he hung up.\" Four frowned. \"This is odd.\"</p>\n<p>\"How so?\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, the Hand normally uses their mumbo jumbo to arrange stuff. Cell phones and back alleys seem\u2026 cheesy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Grims ignored Four as he mused, eyes locked on the tiny group. The rooflines were at least out of the way, he could keep plain-sight contact with them. They were nervous, fidgeting, and it was traveling up the scope to him. Groups like this bolted, he'd seen it a hundred times, and taking pot-shots at a fleeing group on a city sidewalk was not his idea of a good time. Not that he minded, but it was the principle of the thing. He had a certain reputation to ke-</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck is that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Grims silently shifted his hand a fraction, scanning the alleyway. He scoped the back wall of the alley, and froze, blinking quickly to make sure his vision was clear. A huge man stood in the shadows at the end of the alley. Had to be 7 feet tall, at least. Old suit, gloves\u2026 and a burlap bag pulled tight over his head. There was blood on his tie.</p>\n<p>\u201cFour, what in the hell am I looking at?\u201d</p>\n<p>Four ignored him, touching his earbud again. He nodded once, eyes going wide, and nudged Grims with his foot. \u201cShit, keep eyes on him. He was there when Site Seventeen got attacked. They think he might have stolen some stuff, or even been part of the attack\u2026\u201d he trailed off, looking through the binoculars again.</p>\n<p>Grims watched as the big man walked up to the group. They calmed down instantly, nervousness replaced by what looked like fear. The \"librarian\" pulled one of the other group members forward, practically shoving him at the stranger. The kid couldn't have been more then fourteen\u2026 he could almost hear him stuttering from here. Whatever was going on, this kid sure as hell wanted no part of it.</p>\n<p>Four chattered in to his earbud, one hand still on his binoculars. \u201cSmith, do we have ears on them? \u2026what? Say again\u2026 well, fix it!\u201d he hissed, gritting his teeth. \u201cGoddammit, what the hell is going on?\u201d</p>\n<p>Grims ignored him, eyes wide and staring. The big guy had grabbed the kid around the back of the neck, and the kid looked\u2026 wrong, now. His arms were slack, his eyes glassy\u2026 he was talking, but his body looked asleep\u2026 or dead.</p>\n<p>\u201cGrims, do you have a shot?\u201d</p>\n<p>He paused, blinking and focusing on the big man. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSmith is blind, the equipment is fogged out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026sir?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTake it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Grims breathed deep, eye wide, pinning the razor-thin black cross on the brown bag. The kid was still talking in that drugged daze. He squeezed slow, exhaling in a controlled stream-</p>\n<p>The bag turned, it was tilted, it-</p>\n<p>It could see him.</p>\n<p>The finger squeezed on its own, even as Grims croaked a strangled yelp of surprise and horror. The big man pulled the kid up like he was a doll, shifting to the side as the high-velocity round turned the kid's brain to jelly, splattering it on to the alley. It'd taken less then a tenth of a second. Grims panicked, throwing training down a well and started firing wild. Somewhere, someone was screaming at him, hitting him, but it didn't matter. The running shapes didn't matter.</p>\n<p>He had to make that thing die.</p>\n<p>He'd seen some shit, SCP monsters and massacres, torture and moral black areas, but he'd never felt so\u2026 observed. It had looked down that scope, and\u2026 handled him. Like a nasty little boy with sticky, grimy fingers handling a mildly amusing trinket. Whatever the hell that was, it needed to die right the hell now. He kept firing, even as the sirens started and Four abandoned the roof to recover his team, even as his bolt locked back on an empty chamber, he just kept pulling the trigger.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u201cGrims cracked, the Hand is in the wind, we have a possible skip on the way, bag it NOW!\u201d</p>\n<p>Smith didn't even unplug anything, just pressed a switch that fired a electromagnet the size of a mini fridge, frying every single computer in a fifty yard radius. He grabbed up the baseball bat labeled \"The Last Resort,\" and started smashing everything they didn't want the civilians seeing. Howard and Sickle threw down their cards and unslung rifles, moving quickly to the doors. Eighteen started closing up cases and getting the essentials packed. Four was barking orders at any back he saw. The Hand agents were tipped and hauling, and some big bastard had just crossed a busy street and barreled through the boarded up doorway like a bomb.</p>\n<p>Four guessed they had maybe two minutes until whatever the hell the big guy was got up to them on the third floor. Most of the stairs were under construction, so it should slow him down a bit. Howard and Sickle were covering the only two ways in to the room. Smith was getting his gear broken down, and Eighteen was ready to book with the remaining gear the second shit started going down. He thought about trying to recover Grims again. Fuck him, he was fried anyway.</p>\n<p>He was smiling with self-righteous warmth when the wall behind him exploded out around a huge, dark-suited form.</p>\n<p>The big man fell on Four like a thrown couch. As they fell in a heap, two of the Hand agents scrambled through the hole, crying and screaming as they launched at Howard and Sickle. Sickle caught the worst of it, still shocked by the monster who'd blown through the wall, and caught a sharp point of rebar in the neck.

Four tried to scream, or move, but his neck felt like a numb, dead thing, and he couldn't make his arms work. He was still trying to make a fist when the rebar suddenly intruded in to his brain.

As you can see behind me, police are still sifting through what has become one of the worst and most senseless acts of violence in recent memory. Several men, as yet unidentified, broke in to this apartment building, and used it as a \u201csniper's roost\u201d for picking off innocent people. In addition, it appears they killed a work crew who was in one of the remodeled apartments. In total, eight people are dead, with three more injured. One of the shooters, in a bid to escape, attempted to shoot his way through the police blockade and was shot and killed by officers. A second is in custody, found on the roof next to what is presumed to be the murder weapon.</p>\n<p>It's unclear at this point what the goal of the shooters was, or whether it relates to the recent terrorist attacks, however the FBI and Department of Homeland Security have been working closely with police. We'll have more on this story as it develops.

Are we sure we're in the right place? How do we know these aren't just random people waiting for a ride or something?\u201d\n\n\n\nAgent Four grinned, his lean face masked by a massive set of binoculars. \u201cOh no, it's them. See the one with the stack of books wrapped in a belt? We've seen him before.\u201d\n\n\n\n\"What do you suppose is in those books anyway?\"\n\n\n\n\"Not sure. But one of them we recovered was the complete works of Samuel Coleridge, including the full version of 'Kubla Khan.' All three hundred lines.\"\n\n\n\n\"Is that a big deal?\"\n\n\n\nFour sighed. \"Just keep your eye on the targets.\"\n\n\n\nAgent Grims squinted, shifting. He'd been staring down a scope roughly the size of a two-liter, attached to a high-powered, accurate, and very heavy rifle for nearly a hour now. He exhaled loudly, wiping his dark brow and re-fitting it to the eye cup. \u201cWhy are we on lookout? Why isn't the rest of the team moving in?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBecause we need to see what happens first, Grims. Otherwise I'd have you smoke the lot of them and go get a damn beer. They're not supposed to be here, and we just got the info from Scud yesterday. If this pans out, we can figure out what the hell the Serpent's Hand is suddenly on the move for the first time in a year. Now shut up and watch.\u201d\n\n\n\nGrims grumbled under his breath, finger twitching a bit on the trigger. He was sick and tired of being attached to this damn squad. Since the attack, everyone had been shuffled, teams expanded and re-manned, to allow for instant autonomy in case of another communication blackout. Or some such bullshit. All he knew is that he hated working with these damn spooks. At least on the MTF squads, he could joke around, these people-\n\n\n\n\u201cMovement\u2026 movement on the librarian\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nGrims snapped to instantly, sighting in on the target. The man with the books had risen, moving from the sidewalk and down to a small side-alley. The other three people followed close behind, looking very nervous, checking up and down the street.\n\n\n\n\u201cFour, the guy in the blue shirt looks like he's on a phone\u2026 what sho-\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cForget it, Smith already has an intercept\u2026\u201d Agent Four paused, touching his finger to the tiny earbud in his right ear. \u201c\u2026sounds like\u2026 someone's late. They had to change the meeting spot, because they'd been exposed too long\u2026 bah, he hung up.\" Four frowned. \"This is odd.\"\n\n\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, the Hand normally uses their mumbo jumbo to arrange stuff. Cell phones and back alleys seem\u2026 cheesy.\u201d\n\n\n\nGrims ignored Four as he mused, eyes locked on the tiny group. The rooflines were at least out of the way, he could keep plain-sight contact with them. They were nervous, fidgeting, and it was traveling up the scope to him. Groups like this bolted, he'd seen it a hundred times, and taking pot-shots at a fleeing group on a city sidewalk was not his idea of a good time. Not that he minded, but it was the principle of the thing. He had a certain reputation to ke-\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck is that?\u201d\n\n\n\nGrims silently shifted his hand a fraction, scanning the alleyway. He scoped the back wall of the alley, and froze, blinking quickly to make sure his vision was clear. A huge man stood in the shadows at the end of the alley. Had to be 7 feet tall, at least. Old suit, gloves\u2026 and a burlap bag pulled tight over his head. There was blood on his tie.\n\n\n\n\u201cFour, what in the hell am I looking at?\u201d\n\n\n\nFour ignored him, touching his earbud again. He nodded once, eyes going wide, and nudged Grims with his foot. \u201cShit, keep eyes on him. He was there when Site Seventeen got attacked. They think he might have stolen some stuff, or even been part of the attack\u2026\u201d he trailed off, looking through the binoculars again.\n\n\n\nGrims watched as the big man walked up to the group. They calmed down instantly, nervousness replaced by what looked like fear. The \"librarian\" pulled one of the other group members forward, practically shoving him at the stranger. The kid couldn't have been more then fourteen\u2026 he could almost hear him stuttering from here. Whatever was going on, this kid sure as hell wanted no part of it.\n\n\n\nFour chattered in to his earbud, one hand still on his binoculars. \u201cSmith, do we have ears on them? \u2026what? Say again\u2026 well, fix it!\u201d he hissed, gritting his teeth. \u201cGoddammit, what the hell is going on?\u201d\n\n\n\nGrims ignored him, eyes wide and staring. The big guy had grabbed the kid around the back of the neck, and the kid looked\u2026 wrong, now. His arms were slack, his eyes glassy\u2026 he was talking, but his body looked asleep\u2026 or dead.\n\n\n\n\u201cGrims, do you have a shot?\u201d\n\n\n\nHe paused, blinking and focusing on the big man. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSmith is blind, the equipment is fogged out.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026sir?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cTake it.\u201d\n\n\n\nGrims breathed deep, eye wide, pinning the razor-thin black cross on the brown bag. The kid was still talking in that drugged daze. He squeezed slow, exhaling in a controlled stream-\n\n\n\nThe bag turned, it was tilted, it-\n\n\n\nIt could see him.\n\n\n\nThe finger squeezed on its own, even as Grims croaked a strangled yelp of surprise and horror. The big man pulled the kid up like he was a doll, shifting to the side as the high-velocity round turned the kid's brain to jelly, splattering it on to the alley. It'd taken less then a tenth of a second. Grims panicked, throwing training down a well and started firing wild. Somewhere, someone was screaming at him, hitting him, but it didn't matter. The running shapes didn't matter.\n\n\n\nHe had to make that thing die.\n\n\n\nHe'd seen some shit, SCP monsters and massacres, torture and moral black areas, but he'd never felt so\u2026 observed. It had looked down that scope, and\u2026 handled him. Like a nasty little boy with sticky, grimy fingers handling a mildly amusing trinket. Whatever the hell that was, it needed to die right the hell now. He kept firing, even as the sirens started and Four abandoned the roof to recover his team, even as his bolt locked back on an empty chamber, he just kept pulling the trigger.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n\u201cGrims cracked, the Hand is in the wind, we have a possible skip on the way, bag it NOW!\u201d\n\n\n\nSmith didn't even unplug anything, just pressed a switch that fired a electromagnet the size of a mini fridge, frying every single computer in a fifty yard radius. He grabbed up the baseball bat labeled \"The Last Resort,\" and started smashing everything they didn't want the civilians seeing. Howard and Sickle threw down their cards and unslung rifles, moving quickly to the doors. Eighteen started closing up cases and getting the essentials packed. Four was barking orders at any back he saw. The Hand agents were tipped and hauling, and some big bastard had just crossed a busy street and barreled through the boarded up doorway like a bomb.\n\n\n\nFour guessed they had maybe two minutes until whatever the hell the big guy was got up to them on the third floor. Most of the stairs were under construction, so it should slow him down a bit. Howard and Sickle were covering the only two ways in to the room. Smith was getting his gear broken down, and Eighteen was ready to book with the remaining gear the second shit started going down. He thought about trying to recover Grims again. Fuck him, he was fried anyway.\n\n\n\nHe was smiling with self-righteous warmth when the wall behind him exploded out around a huge, dark-suited form.\n\n\n\nThe big man fell on Four like a thrown couch. As they fell in a heap, two of the Hand agents scrambled through the hole, crying and screaming as they launched at Howard and Sickle. Sickle caught the worst of it, still shocked by the monster who'd blown through the wall, and caught a sharp point of rebar in the neck. Howard had time to fire, but in the hazy plaster dust his shot went wild and buried itself in the other Hand agent's leg.\n\n\n\nThe big man held Four by the throat, rising to a crouch and throwing him over to the rebar-armed agent. Four tried to scream, or move, but his neck felt like a numb, dead thing, and he couldn't make his arms work. He was still trying to make a fist when the rebar suddenly intruded in to his brain. Smith and Eighteen were huddled behind Howard, trying to edge out a doorway as the big man stood, plaster and dust turning him into a towering ghost.\n\n\n\nHoward started firing and screaming with equal intensity, shoving Smith and Eighteen out the doorway. The big man dropped like a shot, only to rise with the still-moaning body of the wounded Hand agent held one-handed like a shield. Howard paused a moment, mental gears clicking as he considered, then fired, peppering the agent with slugs as the big man charged. The other Hand agent, still crying pitifully, rose from his bloody work and followed close behind.\n\n\n\nSmith and Eighteen were already nearly halfway down the partial stairs, heading for the presumed safety of the open streets when the gunfire stopped. They looked at each other for a second, exchanging a mutual look of \u201cfuck.\u201d before thundering down the stairs double-time. Smith kept running even when Eighteen screamed, but was forced to turn around when he heard the wet, fleshy thud. Howard's body had hit Eighteen like a nightmare snowball, smashing him in to the wall in a bloody heap, leaving him moaning and broken.\n\n\n\nSmith grabbed Eighteen's cases and ran, ran like a squirrel, ran like the bitch the kids in school had called him, and did so with no qualms at all.\n\n\n\nHe hit the ruined doorway to find a clutch of police and gawkers assembled outside. He froze, trying to think of\u2026 something, anything, some story to use, even as the police aimed guns, screaming for him to freeze, drop what he had. But he had to keep the cases safe, that was his job, his whole reason for being here.\n\n\n\nHe only realized that he had his pistol in hand still when they shot him, and by then it didn't really matter.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nGrims sat on the roof, watching Smith get turned to burger. He'd heard the team get chewed up\u2026now the cops were swarming on Smith's body and his cases. Hopefully he'd armed the detonator inside. Probably not.\n\n\n\nGrims rubbed his face, sighing. For some reason, he'd stayed, just put down the gun after firing it empty, and put his face in his hands. Something was stuck in him, like a glassy little fishbone in his brain. It'd been when that\u2026 thing\u2026 had looked at him. It'd done something. That goddamn \u201cM\u201d word thing they always hammered home in training, he was sure of it.\n\n\n\nThe rooftop door slammed open, the big bag-headed horror stomping out in a haze of white dust. Behind him trailed one of the Hand kids, dragging a length of rebar and wheezing \u201cletmestopletmestop\u201d like a broken recording. Blood was dripping from his eyes.\n\n\n\nGrims leaned back, looking up as the big thing loomed up over him. \u201cSo now what. Tear out my heart, dance around?\u201d he snickered, jerking his chin at the bloody kid. \u201cWhat they hell did they do? Eh? Tell me that, where do they figure?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe big man stayed still, looking down at Grims. He couldn't feel that\u2026 touching.

Humans entering this place are met with warm welcomes and friendly greetings, accompanied by polite requests to \"check your skin at the door\". Subjects who do not immediately flee the place will discover they are in fact able to shed their skin and organs in a similar manner to a heavy overcoat, while still retaining all their former senses and mobility. Interviewed subjects usually describe it as feeling \"liberating\" or other such terms indicating that this absence of flesh is somewhat pleasant, akin to removing restricting clothes. Subjects also report feeling more \"open\"- both literally and metaphorically- and often find it easier to speak freely about themselves or their thoughts amongst other skeletal subjects. While there does not appear to be any compulsion from the grounds itself or its staff forcing goers to remain in the club until it closes, many of them do unless serious obligations (job, family etc.) would require otherwise, though some exceptions to this rule exist (usually where the subject is seriously displeased with said obligation, e.g. dead-end job or unfaithful spouse). In any case, subjects desiring to leave are prevented from doing so without first putting back on their skin and organs, which analysis suggests does not dry out or decay while in storage. Donning a skin is done just as easily as removing it was (seals around its corresponding bones only when applied properly) and does not appear to damage the skin in any way (though direct damage to a vital organ still affects its wearer when they attempt to put it back on). Skeletal subjects that manage to leave the grounds skinless immediately perish- even their skin hanging up in storage ceases to function once its \"owner\" collapses outside the club grounds.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>By <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/kretchsteamclaw\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(1958036); return false;\"><img alt=\"KretchSteamclaw\" class=\"small\" src=\"https://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=1958036&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1656466006\" style=\"background-image:url(https://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=1958036)\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/kretchsteamclaw\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(1958036); return false;\">KretchSteamclaw</a></span></p>\n<p>Do some skip involving platypuses with human faces on their backs.

One or both of the suspects will either claim responsibility for the murders themselves or blame the other suspect, and will give an account of the crime that supports their claim, while the other will assert said account cannot be true, giving their own account of the event that conflicts with or contradicts the first. In any case, evidence recovered at the crime scene will be compatible with both accounts, but may be insufficient to give a clear picture of what happened. If the crime is not correctly \"solved\", i.e. authorities figured out exactly what happened during the event (who was responsible for which death, which details of either story are true, whose idea was it, etc.), within a certain amount of time, both suspects will self-terminate in a manner consistent between incidents, usually with a murder tactic or implement they or the other supposedly used during the crime, and the event will repeat itself some time later.\n\n\n\nEach instance of the crime will have some elements that denote it as an instance of the SCP, i.e. implements used or manner of death of at least one victim, but will otherwise create an entirely new scenario so study of previous instances does not provide any clues to subsequent ones.\n\n\n\nNot exactly sure how this would be contained, or even if it is contained, what makes it spread, how it would recognize having been \"solved\", how the Foundation finds out it needs to be solved, etc.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nBy [[*user MrCobalt]]\n\n\n\nA small-scale replica/floor plan of [your choice of city here] made of dominoes.

For one thing, once the chemicals enter your blood stream, they cannot be turned \"off\"; you'll always be super humanly strong and have to hear people's thoughts, for example. Secondly, real world physics apply; go too fast and your organs get liquefied, or you just catch on fire.

Before you shoot me, these are not your typical werewolves. Firstly, this particular type of lycanthropy is a genetic condition that is only carried by females; the presence of a Y chromosome, for some reason, makes it inactive. Secondly, they do not change with the lunar cycle, but with their menstrual cycle, and gradually change from 100% human to 100% lupine over the course of the cycle. Thirdly, they never stop undergoing oogenesis (the act of creating eggs, which is supposed to stop at birth), meaning they never run out of eggs and therefore never go through menopause. They're also fatally allergic to silver, and can more easily be killed with it, but anything fatal to a human will kill them just as easily.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nBy [[*user Adam Henderson]]\n\n\n\nA horrific body-horror inducing plague which forces its victims into homicidal rampages against the uninfected.

Unforgettably for any would-be astronaut, Wondertainment has shown his/her/its normal disregard for safety, the rocket can at maximum acceleration turn its pilot into gory slime on the floor of its cabin, and while its cabin seems to be radiation-proof and somehow maintain a self-renewing supply of air there's no room for food supplies, no bathroom, and steering the thing in space to the extent of getting home alive is exactly as hard as you'd expect.\n\n\n\nThe foundation got it after it crash landed in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 carrying an unidentified child's corpse, starved to death or crushed by acceleration.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nBy [[*user Adam Henderson]]\n\n\n\nSome kind of creature which has an instinctive ability to control and/or build complex mechanical stuff.

Humans entering this place are met with warm welcomes and friendly greetings, accompanied by polite requests to \"check your skin at the door\". Subjects who do not immediately flee the place will discover they are in fact able to shed their skin and organs in a similar manner to a heavy overcoat, while still retaining all their former senses and mobility. Interviewed subjects usually describe it as feeling \"liberating\" or other such terms indicating that this absence of flesh is somewhat pleasant, akin to removing restricting clothes. Subjects also report feeling more \"open\"- both literally and metaphorically- and often find it easier to speak freely about themselves or their thoughts amongst other skeletal subjects. While there does not appear to be any compulsion from the grounds itself or its staff forcing goers to remain in the club until it closes, many of them do unless serious obligations (job, family etc.) would require otherwise, though some exceptions to this rule exist (usually where the subject is seriously displeased with said obligation, e.g. dead-end job or unfaithful spouse). In any case, subjects desiring to leave are prevented from doing so without first putting back on their skin and organs, which analysis suggests does not dry out or decay while in storage. Donning a skin is done just as easily as removing it was (seals around its corresponding bones only when applied properly) and does not appear to damage the skin in any way (though direct damage to a vital organ still affects its wearer when they attempt to put it back on). Skeletal subjects that manage to leave the grounds skinless immediately perish- even their skin hanging up in storage ceases to function once its \"owner\" collapses outside the club grounds.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nBy [[*user KretchSteamclaw]]\n\n\n\nDo some skip involving platypuses with human faces on their backs.

I have a few questions to ask you.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Edison:</strong> \u2026I\u2019m not in trouble, am I?</p>\n<p><strong>O5-\u2588:</strong> No, of course not. This is simply standard procedure.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Edison:</strong> Oh. Okay then. That\u2019s fine, I guess.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-\u2588:</strong> Glad to hear it. Now, tell me, exactly where were you when the incident began?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Edison:</strong> Well let\u2019s see\u2026 I believe I was in the middle of feeding <a href=\"/scp-391\">SCP-391</a> when I heard the blast. Fearing for my safety, I fled to the nearest security station only to find that the security personnel inside had died prior to my arrival.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-\u2588:</strong> Do you have any idea how they died?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Edison:</strong> No idea, sir. Everyone had a big gash in the back of the head, but it looked like they didn\u2019t have their weapons drawn or anything so I guess they didn\u2019t fight back.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-\u2588:</strong> Interesting. So what did you do?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Edison:</strong> Well, I took one good look at the security monitors and quickly realized how [EXPLETIVE REDACTED] we all\u2026 um, I mean, that we were in the middle of a wide-scale Class-\u2588 containment breach. I tried to activate the self-destruct sequence manually, but the detonation system was apparently too damaged to respond. So I sent a message over the intercom ordering all essential personnel to evacuate, and ordering all remaining security personnel to enter high alert.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-\u2588:</strong> And then what?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Edison:</strong> Well, then I noticed that <a href=\"/scp-353\">SCP-353</a> (who had breached containment), was being escorted by a number of masked men towards section [REDACTED], where we were keeping all the biohazardous materials from Site 19. So I\u2026 um\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>O5-\u2588:</strong> Well? What did you do?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Edison:</strong> I\u2026 went after them. Die Hard style.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-\u2588:</strong> \u2026I beg your pardon?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Edison:</strong> I mean I went after them. Alone. I ran around the site grabbing everything that looked even remotely useful, picked off the masked men one by one using my superior knowledge of Site-17, and squared off with SCP-353 in a climactic showdown inside of the decontamination chamber.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-\u2588:</strong> \u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Edison:</strong> \u2026</p>\n<p><strong>O5-\u2588:</strong> \u2026Is there any chance you \"forgot\" to take your medicine that day?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Edison:</strong> \u2026maybe?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<p>Dr. Edison stared at his watch anxiously. He knew there wasn\u2019t much time, and the rhythmic clacking of 914 only made him even more aware of it.</p>\n<p>And then the clicking stopped. Edison\u2019s heart skipped at beat as the tiny bell rang, letting him know that it was time to check on his little \u201cexperiment\u201d. Nervously, he slid the door open to take a look at the results.</p>\n<p>At first, he didn\u2019t know what to think. At first glance, it appeared to be an orange helmet, similar in form to the bulletproof SWAT helmet he was currently wearing. It even had the kind same \u201cProperty Of\u2026\u201d sticker that his own helmet was labeled with. But upon further inspection, he noticed that the accompanying balaclava appeared to be made of rubber, and that there was some form of breathing apparatus in the spot where one\u2019s mouth would be should be.</p>\n<p>The doctor scratched his head. \u201cWell, it\u2019s getting there, certainly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the radio Edison was carrying on his belt sprung to life. <em>\u201cHey! You!\u201d</em> it said, <em>\u201cYou there! By 914!\u201d</em></p>\n<p>With a sigh, Edison handed the orange helmet to his assistant, who was similarly decked out in SWAT armor. \u201cPlease run this through 914 with helmet 3 on \u2018very fine\u2019, will you? I need to take this call.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wordlessly, the assistant accepted the helmet and stiffly carried it to 914\u2019s input chamber.</p>\n<p>Edison, meanwhile, took the opportunity to answer the radio. \u201cHello\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doing!?\u201d</em> screamed the man on the other end. <em>\u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a containment breach and you\u2019re playing dress up! Does that seem like a good idea to you?!\"</em></p>\n<p>\u201cHey, hey, don\u2019t worry about me,\u201d replied Edison. \u201cLook, everything\u2019s under contro- okay, everything isn\u2019t under control, but you have better things to do than worry about some lone-wolf renegade action movie star type\u2026 thing. You should get out of here before the shit hits the fan, because if I can\u2019t stop Vector, we ALL die.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cWell I\u2019d love to\u2026 but I\u2019m trapped in a security station. The ceiling behind me collapsed, so the door\u2019s jammed behind a huge pile of\u2026 er\u2026\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026What?

Did you just say you were stuck behind a pile of apple-\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cYES, APPLESEEDS!\u201d</em> the man screamed. <em>\u201cTHE DOOR IS STUCK BEHIND A FUCKING PILE OF FUCKING APPLESEEDS! WHY THE HELL ARE THERE SO MANY APPLESEEDS I CANT TAKE ALL THESE APPLESEEDS AND ALL THE APPLESEEDS DAY AND NIGHT AND NIGHT AND DAY AND I CAN\u2019T STAND IT ANYMORE WHY WON\u2019T THEY JUST APPLESEEDS APPLESEEDS APPLESEEDS!!!!!\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Edison paused for a moment to let the man cool off. He could hear a faint sobbing through the radio. \u201c\u2026nice to see you too, Dr. King.\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Debriefing: Dr. King</strong></p>\n<p><em>Excerpt from Interview conducted by O5-\u2588, regarding Dr. King\u2019s involvement in Incident 234-900-Tempest Night-1.</em><br/>\n<strong>O5-\u2588:</strong> Now, Dr. King. From what I\u2019ve heard, you played an instrumental role in directing the flow of information during the incident. Can you please describe exactly what you were trying to accomplish?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. King:</strong> Well, I was mostly just trying to find something to keep my mind off the\u2026 the\u2026 the you-know-whats that were keeping me cooped up in there. I mean, it\u2019s not like there was much else I could do other than watch the monitors and call people with the radio. I\u2019ve really got to hand it to the guys who designed the security system, that security system was state of the art! I don\u2019t think there was a single blind spot in the entire base. I mean-</p>\n<p><strong>O5-\u2588:</strong> \u2026Yes, yes, the art of security is a fascinating one, but I\u2019d much rather hear about your involvement with Dr. Edison\u2019s recent\u2026 \u201cadventure\u201d.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. King:</strong> Oh, that\u2026 <em>[NOTE: Dr. King appears to be visibly distressed at this point]</em> Well\u2026 I found Edison with <a href=\"/scp-912\">SCP-912</a>, making some kind of \u201cSuper-Armor\u201d or something using <a href=\"/scp-914\">SCP-914</a>. He explained that <a href=\"/scp-353\">SCP-353</a> was making her way section [REDACTED], and that unless he stopped her things would get a million times worse.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-\u2588:</strong> \u2026I see\u2026 and how did he plan on doing this?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. King:</strong> Well\u2026 he never explained the whole plan, but he assured me it was extremely clever, intricate, and well-thought-out.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u2003<br/>\n\u201cI\u2019m going to do something extremely clever, intricate, and well-thought-out that\u2019s going to stop Vector and save the world!\u201d Dr. Edison said as he continued to sprint down the hallway. \u201cI\u2019ll get back to you when I know exactly what it is.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cWell I hate to burst your bubble, kid,\u201d</em> said Dr. King, <em>\u201cbut Vector is five stories down, and the insurgents are practically there. You\u2019d have to move at the speed of sound to make it down the stairs in time.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Edison chuckled. \u201cWho said anything about stairs?\u201d He screeched to a halt in front of the doorway he\u2019d been looking for, stepped inside, and found himself in an enormous white room, whose only feature was a small, blue pinwheel, sitting upon a pedestal.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cOh no\u2026\u201d</em> said Dr. King. <em>\u201cYou have GOT to be kidding me\u2026\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cYep!\u201d said Edison. \u201cI\u2019m going to use 161 to drill a hole down to section [REDACTED], one floor at a time, and assault them from the front, holding them off until 912 catches up and surprises them from the back.\u201d Edison reached into his pockets, and pulled out a small squirt bottle, which he used to make a series of red security lasers visible. \u201cBut first, I need to perform some death-defying acrobatics in order to get past this array of invisible crisscrossing lasers, or else I will be fried to a crisp!\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cUh, Ed? You do realize I can just-\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Slowly, Edison backed up to the doorway, and began to swing his arms and count. \u201cOne\u2026 two\u2026 THREE!\u201d</p>\n<p>And with that, the doctor broke into a mad dash, and completely failed to launch himself into a series of amazing front flips that allowed Edison to weave through the beams like a graceful butterfly. The doctor turned red with embarrassment as he fell flat on his face a good ten feet from the nearest laser.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cYeah\u2026 I\u2019m just going to turn these things off before you kill yourself. Why do we even have a room like this?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cNo idea. It was probably one of Bright\u2019s projects.\u201d Edison said as he pulled himself upright. \u201cBut regardless, now 161 is about to within my grasp, there is nothing left to stop me from saving the Foundation!\u201d</p>\n<p>And then a nine-tailed fox tried to bite Dr. Edison\u2019s testicles off.</p>\n<hr/>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Excerpt from security footage of SCP-161\u2019s temporary containment cell (formerly the containment cell of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588), detailing an encounter between Dr. Edison and SCP-953 (in vulpine form), accompanied by Dr. King\u2019s comments via radio from Security Station \u2588.</em></p>\n<p><em>SCP-953 (in vulpine form) tackles Dr. Edison from behind, knocking him over. 953 then attempts to remove Dr. Edison's armor so it can [DATA EXPUNGED].</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Edison:</strong> OH GOD WHERE THE HELL DID SHE COME FROM WHY DIDN\u2019T YOU TELL ME?!</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-953</strong>: [EXPLETIVE]!

Just outside the doorway.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cProbably waiting for me to start running\u2026 dammit\u2026\u201d The doctor slowly began to push himself off the floor, only to have the tip of his nose burnt off by one of the containment beams. \u201cWell, at least I can still move\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cJust hang tight, Ed. I\u2019ll try and find someone to pick you up.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cNo way, doc.\u201d Edison wheezed. \u201cWe\u2019re on the clock here, remember?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cYeah, but\u2026\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cJUST LISTEN TO ME, DAMMIT!\u201d the doctor shouted. \u201cEverything\u2019s going to hell anyway, so what do you care if I die attempting some sort of ridiculous \u2018Action Movie Hero\u2019 plan?

I have a few questions to ask you.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Edison:** \u2026I\u2019m not in trouble, am I?\n\n> \n\n> **O5-\u2588:** No, of course not. This is simply standard procedure.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Edison:** Oh. Okay then. That\u2019s fine, I guess.\n\n> \n\n> **O5-\u2588:** Glad to hear it. Now, tell me, exactly where were you when the incident began?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Edison:** Well let\u2019s see\u2026 I believe I was in the middle of feeding [[[SCP-391]]] when I heard the blast. Fearing for my safety, I fled to the nearest security station only to find that the security personnel inside had died prior to my arrival.\n\n> \n\n> **O5-\u2588:** Do you have any idea how they died?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Edison:** No idea, sir. Everyone had a big gash in the back of the head, but it looked like they didn\u2019t have their weapons drawn or anything so I guess they didn\u2019t fight back.\n\n> \n\n> **O5-\u2588:** Interesting. So what did you do?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Edison:** Well, I took one good look at the security monitors and quickly realized how [EXPLETIVE REDACTED] we all... um, I mean, that we were in the middle of a wide-scale Class-\u2588 containment breach. I tried to activate the self-destruct sequence manually, but the detonation system was apparently too damaged to respond. So I sent a message over the intercom ordering all essential personnel to evacuate, and ordering all remaining security personnel to enter high alert. \n\n> \n\n> **O5-\u2588:** And then what?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Edison:** Well, then I noticed that [[[SCP-353]]] (who had breached containment), was being escorted by a number of masked men towards section [REDACTED], where we were keeping all the biohazardous materials from Site 19. So I\u2026 um\u2026\n\n> \n\n> **O5-\u2588:** Well? What did you do?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Edison:** I... went after them. Die Hard style.\n\n> \n\n> **O5-\u2588:** ...I beg your pardon?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Edison:** I mean I went after them. Alone. I ran around the site grabbing everything that looked even remotely useful, picked off the masked men one by one using my superior knowledge of Site-17, and squared off with SCP-353 in a climactic showdown inside of the decontamination chamber.\n\n> \n\n> **O5-\u2588:** \u2026\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Edison:** \u2026\n\n> \n\n> **O5-\u2588:** \u2026Is there any chance you \"forgot\" to take your medicine that day?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Edison:** \u2026maybe?\n\n-----\n\n\n\nDr. Edison stared at his watch anxiously.\u00a0\u00a0He knew there wasn\u2019t much time, and the rhythmic clacking of 914 only made him even more aware of it. \n\n\n\nAnd then the clicking stopped. Edison\u2019s heart skipped at beat as the tiny bell rang, letting him know that it was time to check on his little \u201cexperiment\u201d. Nervously, he slid the door open to take a look at the results.\n\n\n\nAt first, he didn\u2019t know what to think. At first glance, it appeared to be an orange helmet, similar in form to the bulletproof SWAT helmet he was currently wearing. It even had the kind same \u201cProperty Of\u2026\u201d sticker that his own helmet was labeled with. But upon further inspection, he noticed that the accompanying balaclava appeared to be made of rubber, and that there was some form of breathing apparatus in the spot where one\u2019s mouth would be should be. \n\n\n\nThe doctor scratched his head. \u201cWell, it\u2019s getting there, certainly.\u201d \n\n\n\nSuddenly, the radio Edison was carrying on his belt sprung to life. //\u201cHey! You!\u201d//\u00a0\u00a0it said, //\u201cYou there! By 914!\u201d//\n\n\n\nWith a sigh, Edison handed the orange helmet to his assistant, who was similarly decked out in SWAT armor. \u201cPlease run this through 914 with helmet 3 on \u2018very fine\u2019, will you? I need to take this call.\u201d \n\n\n\nWordlessly, the assistant accepted the helmet and stiffly carried it to 914\u2019s input chamber. \n\n\n\nEdison, meanwhile, took the opportunity to answer the radio. \u201cHello\u2026?\u201d\n\n\n\n//\u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doing!?\u201d// screamed the man on the other end. //\u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a containment breach and you\u2019re playing dress up! Does that seem like a good idea to you?!\"//\n\n\n\n\u201cHey, hey, don\u2019t worry about me,\u201d replied Edison. \u201cLook, everything\u2019s under contro- okay, everything isn\u2019t under control, but you have better things to do than worry about some lone-wolf renegade action movie star type... thing. You should get out of here before the shit hits the fan, because if I can\u2019t stop Vector, we ALL die.\u201d\n\n\n\n//\u201cWell I\u2019d love to\u2026 but I\u2019m trapped in a security station.\u00a0\u00a0The ceiling behind me collapsed, so the door\u2019s jammed behind a huge pile of\u2026 er\u2026\u201d//\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026What? What is it?\u201d\n\n\n\n//\u201cappleseeds.\u201d//\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\n//\u201ca huge pile of appleseeds.\u201d//\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t quite hear that. Did you just say you were stuck behind a pile of apple-\u201d\n\n\n\n//\u201cYES, APPLESEEDS!\u201d// the man screamed. //\u201cTHE DOOR IS STUCK BEHIND A FUCKING PILE OF FUCKING APPLESEEDS! WHY THE HELL ARE THERE SO MANY APPLESEEDS I CANT TAKE ALL THESE APPLESEEDS AND ALL THE APPLESEEDS DAY AND NIGHT AND NIGHT AND DAY AND I CAN\u2019T STAND IT ANYMORE WHY WON\u2019T THEY JUST APPLESEEDS APPLESEEDS APPLESEEDS!!!!!\u201d//\n\n\n\nEdison paused for a moment to let the man cool off. He could hear a faint sobbing through the radio.\u00a0\u00a0\u201c\u2026nice to see you too, Dr. King.\u201d\n\n\n\n------\n\n> \n\n> **Debriefing: Dr. King**\n\n> \n\n> //Excerpt from Interview conducted by O5-\u2588, regarding Dr. King\u2019s involvement in Incident 234-900-Tempest Night-1.//\n\n>\n\n> **O5-\u2588:** Now, Dr. King. From what I\u2019ve heard, you played an instrumental role in directing the flow of information during the incident. Can you please describe exactly what you were trying to accomplish?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. King:** Well, I was mostly just trying to find something to keep my mind off the\u2026 the\u2026 the you-know-whats that were keeping me cooped up in there. I mean, it\u2019s not like there was much else I could do other than watch the monitors and call people with the radio. I\u2019ve really got to hand it to the guys who designed the security system, that security system was state of the art! I don\u2019t think there was a single blind spot in the entire base. I mean-\n\n> \n\n> **O5-\u2588:** \u2026Yes, yes, the art of security is a fascinating one, but I\u2019d much rather hear about your involvement with Dr. Edison\u2019s recent\u2026 \u201cadventure\u201d.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. King:** Oh, that\u2026 //[NOTE: Dr. King appears to be visibly distressed at this point]// Well\u2026 I found Edison with [[[SCP-912]]], making some kind of\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSuper-Armor\u201d or something using [[[SCP-914]]]. He explained that [[[SCP-353]]] was making her way section [REDACTED], and that unless he stopped her things would get a million times worse.\n\n> \n\n> **O5-\u2588:** \u2026I see\u2026 and how did he plan on doing this?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. King:** Well\u2026 he never explained the whole plan, but he assured me it was extremely clever, intricate, and well-thought-out.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\u2003\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to do something extremely clever, intricate, and well-thought-out that\u2019s going to stop Vector and save the world!\u201d Dr. Edison said as he continued to sprint down the hallway. \u201cI\u2019ll get back to you when I know exactly what it is.\u201d\n\n\n\n//\u201cWell I hate to burst your bubble, kid,\u201d// said Dr. King, //\u201cbut Vector is five stories down, and the insurgents are practically there. You\u2019d have to move at the speed of sound to make it down the stairs in time.\u201d//\n\n\u00a0\n\nEdison chuckled. \u201cWho said anything about stairs?\u201d He screeched to a halt in front of the doorway he\u2019d been looking for, stepped inside, and found himself in an enormous white room, whose only feature was a small, blue pinwheel, sitting upon a pedestal.\n\n\n\n//\u201cOh no\u2026\u201d// said Dr. King. //\u201cYou have GOT to be kidding me\u2026\u201d//\n\n\n\n\u201cYep!\u201d said Edison. \u201cI\u2019m going to use 161 to drill a hole down to section [REDACTED], one floor at a time, and assault them from the front, holding them off until 912 catches up and surprises them from the back.\u201d Edison reached into his pockets, and pulled out a small squirt bottle, which he used to make a series of red security lasers visible. \u201cBut first, I need to perform some death-defying acrobatics in order to get past this array of invisible crisscrossing lasers, or else I will be fried to a crisp!\u201d \n\n\n\n//\u201cUh, Ed? You do realize I can just-\u201d//\n\n\n\nSlowly, Edison backed up to the doorway, and began to swing his arms and count. \u201cOne\u2026 two\u2026 THREE!\u201d \n\n\n\nAnd with that, the doctor broke into a mad dash, and completely failed to launch himself into a series of amazing front flips that allowed Edison to weave through the beams like a graceful butterfly. The doctor turned red with embarrassment as he fell flat on his face a good ten feet from the nearest laser.\n\n\n\n//\u201cYeah\u2026 I\u2019m just going to turn these things off before you kill yourself. Why do we even have a room like this?\u201d//\n\n\n\n\u201cNo idea. It was probably one of Bright\u2019s projects.\u201d Edison said as he pulled himself upright. \u201cBut regardless, now 161 is about to within my grasp, there is nothing left to stop me from saving the Foundation!\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd then a nine-tailed fox tried to bite Dr. Edison\u2019s testicles off.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n> //Excerpt from security footage of SCP-161\u2019s temporary containment cell (formerly the containment cell of SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588), detailing an encounter between Dr. Edison and SCP-953 (in vulpine form), accompanied by Dr. King\u2019s comments via radio from Security Station \u2588.//\n\n> \n\n> //SCP-953 (in vulpine form) tackles Dr. Edison from behind, knocking him over. 953 then attempts to remove Dr. Edison's armor so it can [DATA EXPUNGED].//\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Edison:** OH GOD WHERE THE HELL DID SHE COME FROM WHY DIDN\u2019T YOU TELL ME?!\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-953**: [EXPLETIVE]! How dare you [REDACTED]!\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. King**: Why does she hate you so much?!\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Edison:** HOW SHOULD I KNOW [EXPLETIVE] DO SOMETHING MAN!\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. King**: I could turn the lasers back on, but-\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Edison:** I DON\u2019T CARE JUST- OH GOD, MY [REDACTED]! SHE\u2019S GOT MY [REDACTED]!\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n//\u201cYou okay?\u201d// said Dr. King, his voice slightly distorted by radio static.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you mean, \u2018am I still alive\u2019, then just barely.\u201d Dr. Edison groaned. \u201cMan, I can\u2019t believe that bitch is still worked up about that\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n//\u201cAbout what?\u201d// said Dr. King.\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, you know that little disclaimer about not calling 953 a \u2018Kitsune\u2019?\u201d\n\n\n\n//\u201cYeah?\u201d//\n\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say I watch too much anime and leave it at that.\u201d Dr. Edison attempted to produce a faint chuckle from his lame joke, followed by a deep, hacking cough. \u201cShe\u2019s still there isn\u2019t she?\"\n\n\n\n//\u201cYep. Just outside the doorway.\u201d//\n\n\n\n\u201cProbably waiting for me to start running\u2026 dammit\u2026\u201d The doctor slowly began to push himself off the floor, only to have the tip of his nose burnt off by one of the containment beams. \u201cWell, at least I can still move\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n//\u201cJust hang tight, Ed. I\u2019ll try and find someone to pick you up.\u201d//\n\n\n\n\u201cNo way, doc.\u201d Edison wheezed. \u201cWe\u2019re on the clock here, remember?\u201d \n\n\n\n//\u201cYeah, but\u2026\u201d//\n\n\n\n\u201cJUST LISTEN TO ME, DAMMIT!\u201d the doctor shouted. \u201cEverything\u2019s going to hell anyway, so what do you care if I die attempting some sort of ridiculous \u2018Action Movie Hero\u2019 plan? This sort of disaster happens only once in a lifetime, and I\u2019ll be damned if I spend it sitting in a corner holding my eyes closed.\u201d\n\n\n\n//\u201cAre you trying to tell me something?\u201d//\n\n\n\n\u201cAm I trying to tell you something? AM I TRYING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING!? Yeah, I\u2019m trying to tell you something all right!\" Dr. Edison took a deep breath. \"It\u2019s Game Day, King. And it\u2019s not just any game, King, it\u2019s the World Series and we\u2019re playing for the Stanley Cup. The other team\u2019s up by a field goal, It\u2019s the bottom of the ninth, bases loaded, 4th down, our star player is in the penalty box, and the big man's about 2 WREAK SOME HAVOC on the court!\u201d\n\n\n\nDr. King was speechless.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo do you want that gold medal, or are you going to take a penalty kick with the rest of those losers?!\u201d\n\n\n\n//\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t even know where to begin with that.\u201d// said Dr. King.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I like to hear!\u201d said Dr. Edison. \u201cNow, on the count of three, I want you to turn off the containment beams so I can grab 161. Ready?\u201d\n\n\n\n//\u201cNow wait a second, I never said I would-\u201d//\n\n\n\n\u201c1\u2026 2\u2026 3!\u201d\n\n\n\nIn a flash, Dr. Edison jolted upright, and sprinting towards the pinwheel, ignoring the stinging from his numerous wounds. Moments later, 953 burst though the door, and began to chase after him.\n\n\n\n//\u201cGet out of there, Ed!\u201d// said Dr. King.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo! I got a head start!

Agent Rose and Agent Walker, security. They did that every time Dr. Drake opened his mouth, each time tingling with almost animalistic animosity. The two ex-members of the Children of the Sun were objectively creepy as shit, she reflected. The way they did so many things in synchronization. You'd think they were twins, but they didn't even look alike, even if their mannerisms tended to be identical Rose (a man) was pale and androgynous, and Walker (a woman) was attractive in a classical fashion and had skin dark as pitch. She'd been working with them almost two years now, and she felt the same affection for them that she might feel for a pair of cats.

They wore identical expressions of barely repressed fury. Mause, for her part, only felt mild annoyance. Most people knew better than to make that joke in front of Rose and Walker, but Mause heard the joke about every other day. She'd long gotten over cursing Fate for the timing of her transfer to the Special Reconnaissance-and-Research Task Force M-Omega-773 - or, as it was now so wittily referred to by other members of the Foundation, \"the Deadly Moose team\".</p>\n<p>She'd been dumped from Research Team MO3-Gloria with everyone else when the O5s decided they didn't want anyone else poking at 003 and landed her directly in M-Omega-773 just in time for the disaster in which she - and every other member of the team - had stumbled through the corridors of Site 19 crazily warning everyone they came in to \"beware the deadly moose\". She herself had set up shop in the cafeteria with a shotgun for two hours before security tranquilized her and strapped her to a bed until the effects passed.</p>\n<p>Memetics. She hated memetics.</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" she said. \"Alaskan moose, actually. <em>A. a. gigas</em>. Which fits with where we picked it up. Naturally.\"</p>\n<p>\"No Bigfoot bones in there?\"</p>\n<p>\"No.\" She glared at her monitor. \"We're not so sure that this thing has any connection to 1000 after all, I'm sorry to say.\"</p>\n<p>Drake looked at the video monitor. \"But just look at it. It looks like a big green ape.\"</p>\n<p>\"SCP-1000 instances are brown, black, red, and white in color,\" Mause said. \"They don't come in green.\"</p>\n<p>\"Still,\" Drake said. \"My gut tells me there's some connection. Keep looking.\"</p>\n<p>Mause stifled her sigh. Technically, Drake did outrank her. Being on the Deadly Moose team meant you got ridiculously high clearance to a few fairly important SCPs, but outside of those small spheres you were left at basic level 1 access. And the respect that went with that. It didn't help that most of the team's assignments sounded inherently mockable. 'The Bloodstone.' (Also known as the bad-trip ruby, even though it wasn't actually a ruby.) The glorified mechanical people-eating fishing worms. Organic motherboard. ('So can 003 run Crysis?' Jesus, you'd think these people never grew out of the 90's.) Bigfoot, for chrissake. And, of course, the goddamn moose\u2026 <em>thing</em>.</p>\n<p>And now, the weird thing pacing about in the temporary containment cell on the monitor, provisionally classified as Anomalous Humanoid TXCD-R.</p>\n<p>The thing whose vomit she was analyzing for the last half hour. TXCD-R was picked up in Alaska only days ago, and had slaughtered half the task force sent to capture it before suddenly going docile and allowing the rattled survivors to bind it in a net and transport it to Site 17's temporary containment auxiliary facility.</p>\n<p>It really was beautiful vomit, full of living things she'd never seen, in a rainbow array of colors. Even TXCD-R was beautiful in its own way. She watched it pace, a hulking seven-foot-tall thing shaped vaguely like an ape, covered in what might be a living growth of moss, wide teeth like spades sticking out of its mouth like reversed elephant tusks. The \"moss\" was growing so fast you could actually see it move if you had the patience. Tiny glittering eyes peered out from under the moss curtains - not just from its \"head\", either. Tiny auxiliary limbs moved and twitched, peeking out now and then to groom the ever-growing moss.</p>\n<p>As she watched, TXCD-R bent double and vomited for the ninth time that day.</p>\n<p>\"Again?\" Mause scratched her head. \"It's vomited up almost the entire bodies of everything it's eaten so far. And judging by the bones I see, that would be the last of its meals for the past week.\" She looked at the screen again. \"It's not digesting anything. None of the things in here have been broken down like you'd expect if they'd been in stomach acid for hours. They have signs of chewing, and not much else. Is it sick or something?\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm telling you,\" Drake said. \"It's got Bigfoot's fingerprints all over it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Tomorrow,\" Mause said.

Agent Rose and Agent Walker, security. They did that every time Dr. Drake opened his mouth, each time tingling with almost animalistic animosity. The two ex-members of the Children of the Sun were objectively creepy as shit, she reflected. The way they did so many things in synchronization. You'd think they were twins, but they didn't even look alike, even if their mannerisms tended to be identical Rose (a man) was pale and androgynous, and Walker (a woman) was attractive in a classical fashion and had skin dark as pitch. She'd been working with them almost two years now, and she felt the same affection for them that she might feel for a pair of cats. A pair of extremely murderous cats, anyway. \n\n\n\nPlus, they hated Drake almost as much as she did. \n\n\n\n\"Yes,\" she agreed, \"it's vomit. But that doesn't preclude beauty.\" \n\n\n\nShe zoomed out again. Drake pointed at a structure in the gray-green mess. \"Is that a bone?\"\n\n\n\n\"Indeed,\" Mause said. \"//Alces alces.// And they're not the only thing our green friend has been eating. I've found at least three different species of squirrel. And what's probably a squirrel. But most of the bones are //Alces alces//.\"\n\n\n\nDrake leaned back in his chair, propped his legs up on the desk in front of him. \"What's an //Alces alces//?\"\n\n\n\nShe rolled her eyes in advance. \"One of the cervids, a capreoline. Known in North America, of course, as... the moose.\"\n\n\n\nDrake sniggered. \"Moose, eh?\" Then sniggered again. \"Moose.\"\n\n\n\nMause's eyes flicked to Rose and Walker. They wore identical expressions of barely repressed fury. Mause, for her part, only felt mild annoyance. Most people knew better than to make that joke in front of Rose and Walker, but Mause heard the joke about every other day. She'd long gotten over cursing Fate for the timing of her transfer to the Special Reconnaissance-and-Research Task Force M-Omega-773 - or, as it was now so wittily referred to by other members of the Foundation, \"the Deadly Moose team\".\n\n\n\nShe'd been dumped from Research Team MO3-Gloria with everyone else when the O5s decided they didn't want anyone else poking at 003 and landed her directly in M-Omega-773 just in time for the disaster in which she - and every other member of the team - had stumbled through the corridors of Site 19 crazily warning everyone they came in to \"beware the deadly moose\".

Dr. Drake places the circlet on his head while shouting \"Crown of Thorns, activate!\" Anomalous Item 56428609 emits a nimbus of glowing light.\n\n> \n\n> **1159:** TXCD-R removes the top of Dr. Drake's head via aggressive mastication. TXCD-R consumes both the top of Dr. Drake's head and Anomalous Item 56428609. TXCD-R exits through the open service entrance.\n\n> \n\n> **1200:** No further activity.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n\"It's eating SCPs,\" Rose said, as a group of other agents carried away Dr. Drake's body. \"That's why it killed an instance of SCP-870. And took SCP-472. It's a food source.\"\n\n\n\n\"Quite a theory,\" Mause said. \"Maybe that's why it vomited everything it ate... Maybe it wasn't built to be eating ... uh, //natural// things, for lack of a better word. Of course, why would it be able to keep down SCP items? It's not like 472 and 870 have anything in common. Or that anomalous item. Natural things have much more in common than anomalous things. How could something evolve to eat anomalous items?\"\n\n\n\n\"Maybe it didn't evolve,\" Walker said. \"Maybe it was created.\"\n\n\n\nMause shrugged. \"I guess we won't know until we get it back.\"\n\n\n\n\"Then let's get started,\" Rose said.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["scp-472", "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "licensing-guide", "licensing-master-list"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "game-day", "tale"], "title": "Game Day Part 1: Mastication, Deglutition, Emesis - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/game-day-1-dr-mause", "year": 2011}, "game-day-1-johannes-sorts": {"created_at": "2011-10-04T21:12:00", "creator": "Sorts", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Sorts", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sorts", "comment": "", "date": "2011-10-04T21:12:00"}, {"author": "Sorts", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sorts", "comment": "You successfully renamed the page: \"game-day-part-1:attack-of-the-replicas\" to \"game-day-1:johannes-sorts\".", "date": "2011-10-04T21:13:00"}, {"author": "Sorts", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sorts", "comment": "", "date": "2011-10-04T22:44:00"}, {"author": "DrClef", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drclef", "comment": "Added tags: game_day.

At this point, the method by which the devices were placed in the facility is unknown, as no security breaches were reported for several months before the incident. The most likely method (internal security breach) may never be proven, as any suborned personnel and/or evidence of their wrongdoing may have been destroyed in the attack.</p>\n<p>One explosive device, placed in Conference Room 9b, resulted in death or injury to several key senior staff members, resulting in the loss of the top three levels of site leadership. This particular device would contribute significantly to the chaos which ensued: due to the severe breakdown in the chain of command, individual Foundation personnel would be forced to respond to the attack without coordination. In most cases, they performed admirably given the situation: especially during the early moments of the attack, when the nature of the containment breach was then unknown.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Surveillance Log 17-CR9b-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, 0805</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>&lt;A.

I woke up when they went off, of course.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:</strong> What was your initial reaction?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Vang:</strong> I just laid there a bit until the gunfire started, then I decided to report to the infirmary to get an amnestic. You see, the SCP I was working on, some of the initial tests indicate that the symptoms include auditory hallucinations. I figured an amnestic might fix it.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:</strong> I see. Carry on.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Vang:</strong> So, I was approaching an intersection in the hallway when I saw one of our security guards trading fire with someone I couldn't see. It dawned on me that it was all real when the top half of his head got blown up.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:</strong> And then?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Vang:</strong> I ran the other direction, hid in the closet, and hyperventilated for a while. When I calmed down, I ran back into the MRI lab to get my laptop.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:</strong> Why?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Vang:</strong> Well, I fell asleep last night before I could log out, and I had neglected to log out when I had woken up, so anyone could have gotten sensitive information off of it. Anyways, when I got back, my laptop was gone, and so was one of the desktops.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:</strong> What was on those computers?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Vang:</strong> I don't know about the desktop, but my laptop had some of my project files on it. Most of my projects involve abnormal memorability, so about ninety percent of it was just particularly catchy songs. In addition to that, there was a copy of the Communist Manifesto written entirely in pig latin, and there were nine variations of-</p>\n<p><strong>Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:</strong> Anything <em>important</em>?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Vang:</strong> Sorry, sir. One of my USBs had a minute-long clip of <a href=\"/scp-444\">SCP-444</a>, and my laptop had a photo that makes you dizzy for a minute or so when you look at it. Those are the only things I can think of that would be of any real importance.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:</strong> Very good. Now, back to the MRI Lab. What was your course of action?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Vang:</strong> Well, I realized that it would be a pretty bad thing if someone attacking the site had four forty-four, considering that a good portion of <em>our</em> work with it is weaponization. I looked around, and none of the rooms around me looked like anything was stolen from them, so I figured that whoever took my computer had a good idea of what they were looking for. I heard someone coming, so I ducked into the break room.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:</strong> What happened next?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Vang:</strong> Whoever it was, they ran past, so I sat down and thought for a minute or so. I went to the fridge, grabbed a bottle of root beer, and broke it. To get a weapon, you know. I changed into my backup pants, then I stuffed my pockets with as many of the emergency ear plugs as I could find and went out to distribute them to our guys.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:</strong> Emergency ear plugs?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Vang:</strong> It's the memetics department, sir.

Well, until the klaxon went off, anyways. Then all the guards started scrambling for the doors into the rest of site.</p>\n<p><strong>SA:</strong> And what did you do?</p>\n<p><strong>AB:</strong> What any good boy scout would do: I decided to investigate the SCPs that nobody had yet bothered to pick up.

Unidentified assailant runs from behind the holder of the cell phone towards Prof. Bjornsen, screaming and brandishing a large knife in each hand. Two (2) cellulose tentacles emerge from SCP-262 and grab weaponry from the bodies of the guards. The tentacles rapidly retreat towards Prof. Bjornsen and two human arms emerge to take the firearms. These arms immediately proceed to fire the weapons indiscrimately. Analysis of the recovered footage reveals that shots fired struck the ceiling, floor, both walls, the oncoming assailant and at least one round grazed Prof. Bjornsen's left cheek. The holder of the cell-phone is apparently wounded by the weaponsfire and drops the cell-phone. Remaining footage is taken approximately twelve (12) centimeters from the base of a wall before ending.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>*AUDIO/VIDEO TRANSCRIPT - TRACKING INDIVIDUALS DESIGNATE \"Senior Staff Dr. A.

Ironically, a significant portion of the containment breaches were caused by Foundation personnel themselves, in an attempt to stop the incursion by the unknown hostile force. Secondary containment breaches followed, resulting in the Foundation-Wide Alert Status being upgraded to Red.</p>\n<p>The result was complete loss of situational control. Without a central coordinating authority, individual Foundation personnel were working at cross-purposes, interfering with and even counteracting each others' actions. In at least one case, a Foundation scientist's heroic sacrifice in maintaining containment of a Euclid-Class artifact was immediately rendered null and void when another Foundation researcher immediately breached containment of said artifact with the intent to use it as a weapon against the insurgent forces.</p>\n<p>The situation would continue until the re-establishment of intra-site communications by Secretary Adams. By that point, however, the situation had proceeded past the point of no return. Many of the SCP artifacts had broken through the site lockdown and escaped into the wild.

Adams</strong> leaves the room.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Excerpt from debriefing of Prof. Anders Bjornsen</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>SA:</strong> What were you doing when you encountered Ms. Adams?</p>\n<p><strong>AB:</strong> I was outside Decon 6, wrestling with one of the arms, trying to pry loose the last of the guns. I'm pretty sure it was already out of ammo, but I didn't want one of the others to pick up a clip somewhere and reload it.</p>\n<p><strong>SA:</strong> Decontamination Wing 6 is quite a distance from the transport depot or your designated containment breach evacuation point. Why were you there?</p>\n<p><strong>AB:</strong> The explosions had filled a lot of the hallways with rubble and I was trying to get to the containment chamber of SCP-200. It was the only place I could think of that was reasonably secure, assuming that it hadn't been collapsed. Decon 6 was on the quickest path to get there.</p>\n<p><strong>SA:</strong> How did you recognize Ms. Adams?</p>\n<p><strong>AB:</strong> I'd seen her in the cafeteria a couple of times before, once with Director Clef, so I figured she belonged. She was headed straight for the doors into Decon, but I stopped her before she went in.</p>\n<p><strong>SA:</strong> Why was that?</p>\n<p><strong>AB:</strong> I'd already peeked in there and it was fucking chaos. All safe or euclid class SCPs have to go through it, even if they're well-documented, but it's only supposed to be temporary containment and the explosions must've cracked some of the walls. At least half the chamber doors were open and I saw about 8 or 10 people in what looked like riot gear, piling a ton of shit into some metal boxes. Paperwork, at least one laptop, and I think I saw a birdcage with something moving in it. Their gear didn't have any of the guards' markings on them, so I figured that they weren't part of the Foundation.</p>\n<p><strong>SA:</strong> What did Ms. Adams do when you told her this?</p>\n<p><strong>AB:</strong> What do you think she did? She cursed and asked if there was any other way around it.</p>\n<p><strong>SA:</strong> Was there?</p>\n<p><strong>AB:</strong> She obviously found one, or we wouldn't be here. I told her to follow me and we took the long way around until we got to the security station outside the Safe Humanoids wing. It took us about 20 minutes, since we had to backtrack a couple of times when we hit blocked hallways or more groups of those riot-gear guys. One time they were carrying something in a body bag that was struggling pretty fiercely.</p>\n<p><strong>SA:</strong> Did you encounter any SCPs on your way?</p>\n<p><strong>AB:</strong> Not that I know of. I smelled something burning a couple of times and I was told later that there was a loose SCP made of fire. And when we finally got to the security station outside the Safe Humanoids wing, we found that all the guards had been decapitated and burned. I was almost at SCP-200's chamber, so I figured that I was almost as safe as I was going to get, and pointed her down to Protective Materials. Assuming that she didn't encounter anything else, she should've been there in about 10 minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>SA:</strong> After Ms. Adams left you, what did you do?</p>\n<p><strong>AB:</strong> I went into the Humanoids wing. Unfortunately, it'd been pretty trashed too, although I don't know if it was from the explosions, from the invading force, or one of the escaped SCPs. I do know that when I got to SCP-200's chamber, the door was wide open and the damn cocoon was ripped to shreds. And I couldn't even hole up there because the damn handle was ripped off and the door wouldn't close.</p>\n<p><strong>SA:</strong> Security camera footage shows that you didn't stay in the Humanoids Wing very long. If you were looking for a safe place to hole up, why did you leave?</p>\n<p><strong>AB:</strong> Well, like I said, the place was pretty trashed, so it wasn't really any safer than the rest of the Site. Also\u2026 I kinda felt responsible for SCP-200, even though I wasn't on that project any more. I'd spent over a year studying it and if it had finally emerged, I sorta wanted to see what it was. If it was moderately harmless, I could hopefully herd it back into containment and if it wasn't\u2026 well, I figured I could at least get some observations for the next guy to review.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Audio Log from Hallway 34</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Agent Lombardi:</strong> \"Hold up.

Around 0832, it is estimated that Containment Breach 13-34 occurred at Temporary Containment Area 17-Gamma. Assistant Researcher Huang was an eyewitness of Containment Breach 13-34 and the immediate aftermath.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>O5-\u2588:</strong> Describe the events leading up to Containment Breach 13-34.</p>\n<p><strong>Huang:</strong> People flocked to 17-Gamma for safety. The logic was that if it could contain a Keter-class SCP object, then it could protect them from the attackers. Though communication with the main Site had been disabled, 17-Gamma was believed to be one of the safest places in Site-17. Basic security had remained uncompromised, and there were plenty of weapons. At 0823, of course, the attack by\u2014</p>\n<p><em>Huang coughs.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Huang:</strong> Excuse me. 17-Gamma came under attack. Many Foundation personnel, having\u2026collected SCP objects from Site-17, began to use those objects in order to repel the attackers.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-\u2588:</strong> They intentionally breached containment for those objects?</p>\n<p><strong>Huang:</strong> Not everybody. The explosions had already breached containment for some objects, which were just picked up off the ground.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-\u2588:</strong> Did you do that?</p>\n<p><strong>Huang:</strong> No.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-\u2588:</strong> Please continue.</p>\n<p><strong>Huang:</strong> The exact details escape me. However, approximately thirty seconds into the firefight, I became aware of somebody using <a href=\"/scp-399\">SCP-399</a> as an enhanced stunner by producing what I presume to be some sort of pressure shockwave. Perhaps unauthorized usage of SCP-914 provided a power source.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-\u2588:</strong> Do you know exactly how 17-Gamma\u2019s containment unit was breached?</p>\n<p><strong>Huang:</strong> No. I didn\u2019t even see it happen. Maybe a stray grenade caused structural damage. But even if I had seen the breach occur, I wouldn\u2019t have understood the significance. I didn\u2019t know what 17-Gamma was containing. I didn\u2019t have the clearance. I assume that many others were similarly unaware. In the absence of a chain of command, we simply didn\u2019t know where not to go and what not to do.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-\u2588:</strong> What happened during Containment Breach 13-34?</p>\n<p><strong>Huang:</strong> The shockwaves were very loud, which already exacerbated the situation. However, that alone was not enough to cause the destruction associated with Containment Breach 13-34. I am not entirely certain, but I have my suspicions about what did. A piece of metal debris that resonated with a shockwave in just the right way, producing a sound quite like a bell\u2026we all know what happened next. I remember an explosion of wings, and then, nothing. I woke up a few minutes later. <a href=\"/scp-469\">SCP-469</a> was nowhere in sight.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-\u2588:</strong> So Containment Breach 13-34 was the result of unfortunate coincidence?</p>\n<p><strong>Huang:</strong> Maybe. But fifty-two people died in Containment Breach 13-34. If you wish to attribute that to unfortunate coincidence, that\u2019s your decision, sir.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<h4 id=\"toc3\"><span>0916 to 1103: Disorder</span></h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This period of the crisis can be considered the nadir of the incident: due to complete loss of containment and the presence of the hostile party, Foundation elements were rendered both operational and combat ineffective. Hostile elements had free reign of the facility, and many priceless artifacts were lost. The situation was further exacerbated by a complete release of D-Class personnel when confinement protocols failed. The presence of several hundred hardened criminals in this crisis situation was, to put it mildly, not optimally conducive to maintaining order.</p>\n<p>It is at this point that certain facts about the hostile force became evident. Firstly, the training and skill level of the hostiles were widely disparate: certain elements displayed paramilitary levels of combat and tactical expertise, while others were clearly untrained civilians. Secondly, the goal of the hostile force was not capture, but release of the contained artifacts: although some opportunistic looting took place, escaping SCP artifacts were not pursued, but allowed to escape.</p>\n<p>It is for this reason that I believe that the hostile force were not directed by Marshall, Carter, and Dark: MC&amp;D would not have passed up the opportunity to retrieve several key artifacts that could have proven lucrative to their private efforts. The modus operandi is also inconsistent with the GOC or the Chaos Insurgency: Among other things, the Global Occult Coalition would have simply eradicated the entire site, while the Insurgency would not have passed up the opportunity to capture several easily weaponized artifacts for private use. Although the goals seem consistent with the group called the Serpent's Hand, the brazen nature of the attack (and the lack of SCP-class artifacts among the attackers) are not characteristic of that organization's modus operandi. Further research is required.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Archived email message</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Sent: \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 10:24 GMT<br/>\nFrom: skatz@\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.org<br/>\nTo: facilitiesmanager@\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.org<br/>\nRe: Parking lot</em></p>\n<p>Jerry\u2014 when I went back to the parking lot to head back to my office in the city, my car was gone and there was just this smoking crater where my parking spot used to be.

Surveillance of experiment 966-\u2588\u2588, regarding the possibility of sapience in SCP-966 specimens.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</strong>: Describe what happened following the beginning of the incident.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Izumi</strong>: The incident began as the doors to 966 chamber were opened in order to conduct the experiment. The explosions caused a momentary malfunction of the surveillance cameras and light equipment inside the room. Showing previously unknown cognitive capacity, the four 966 specimens contained overwhelmed the security guard in the room, removed his lead-lined helmet and appeared to continuously expose him to their \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 waves for 10 seconds. As I equipped infrared goggles and entered the room in order to terminate them, the guard began to shout incoherently and shoot in all directions. I dived for cover and waited for his bullets to end. Unfortunately, this brief window of time allowed the four specimens to escape.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</strong>: The guard didn't hit any of them?</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Izumi</strong>: He seems to have hit at least one, as I could see splatters and a trail of what I deduced to be blood; it is hard to tell in infrared.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</strong>: I see. What did you do?</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Izumi</strong>: I locked the doors to the chamber and followed the blood trail, hoping to find and neutralize the escaped specimens. The explosions still seemed to be going off; one happened approximately 300 meters away from me. After that one, I heard a loud, inhuman scream that was suddenly cut short. Walking in its direction, I verified that two instances of 966 had been killed by the explosion.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</strong>: And there were no traces of the two remaining specimens?</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Izumi</strong>: No. There were traces of something else, though. It was hard to notice it because of my goggles, but it was clear what it was once it grabbed my arm.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Video log, Hallway 23.

A rotted humanoid arm suddenly appears and grabs the agent's left arm. She proceeds to immediately turn and shoot SCP-106's arm, which maintains his hold on her. After running out of bullets, agent Izumi proceeds to grab a rock and repeatedly hit 106's arm with it. At this point, 106 begins to slowly pull her in the direction of the wall.</em></p>\n<p><em>This proceeds for half a minute, until the agent proceeds to beat her own arm with the rock. Due to the corrosion caused by contact with 106, her arm is severed after 6 hits.

Flames/O5-\u2588</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>O5-\u2588:</strong> Now, where were you when the incident began?</p>\n<p><strong>Flames:</strong> I was in Laboratory K-13 at the time, working on the new <em>Capsicum chinense</em> cultivars I'd obtained from Chelsea, ah, that is, Dr. Elliott. We had been jokingly calling them Liche Chilis, since they were descended from the more common Ghosts\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>O5-\u2588:</strong> Yes, thank you. And what did you do when the alert happened.</p>\n<p><strong>Flames:</strong> Honestly, I didn't give it much thought. I sighed, set up the dragon, and went back to work.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-\u2588:</strong> Excuse me?</p>\n<p><strong>Flames:</strong> Well, they had given me K-13 to work with because it was so remote from everything else, because people kept complaining about eye irritation and their sinuses, so I figured either everything would work out, and I'd be fine, or it wouldn't and the site nuke would go off and there'd be nothing else to do. So, I went back to work.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-\u2588:</strong> And \"the dragon\"?</p>\n<p><strong>Flames:</strong> My pet name for the fire extinguisher I modified to spray out my Garlic Fission sauce. It's a delicious sauce, and rates at about 1.7 million Scovilles. The amusing thing about Garlic Fission is that gas masks only offer limited resistance. I like adding it to soup for a little kick.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-\u2588:</strong> Yes\u2026 continue.</p>\n<p><strong>Flames:</strong> About fifty minutes later, I started feeling a little odd. I felt, I don't know, like my chilis weren't really worth it, and that nothing was. I recognized it as a possible memetic effect, of course, but I just didn't care. That was when my door opened, and the insurgent walked in.</p>\n<p>She was drenched in blood up to her shoulders, and had a look of\u2026 satisfaction, I suppose. She was enjoying herself, and she held a chef's knife in her hands. I figured afterwards it was <a href=\"/scp-668\">six sixty-eight</a>, but I just didn't care enough to do anything about it.</p>\n<p>Fortunately for me, that was when the dragon went off, and sprayed her with the Garlic Fission sauce. She dropped the knife and my mind cleared, so I brained her with a lab stool. I did not want her to get back up again, so I grabbed the knife and slit her throat. She stopped struggling, of course, when I picked up the knife, so I knew it was six sixty-eight.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-\u2588:</strong> I see. So why did you head to the main cafeteria at that point?</p>\n<p><strong>Flames:</strong> Well, I thought it over like this while cleaning up the mess. I have a knife that will let me kill anyone and stop them from killing me, but only when it's in my hand and I'm actively thinking about mayhem. I do have a bit of a temper, of course, because I loathe interruptions to my work, and the solution presented itself. I'd head to the main cafeteria and finally make some good food that the whole site could enjoy. I had some recipes I'd found online that I'd been wanting to try, and finally I'd be able to use the big ovens to make my grandma's corn bread recipe.</p>\n<p>I figured it would make a sort of safe haven for people and a bit of a honey pot, because any insurgents show up, I'd be in the kitchen and I could deal with them.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-\u2588:</strong> Sounds\u2026 sketchy.</p>\n<p><strong>Flames:</strong> Yeah, I guess so. But I really wanted to use those ovens, and I thought, when would I have the chance?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Transcript of Security Camera 0046782</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>1020</strong> Agent [REDACTED], and Dr. Dier observed exiting from Stairwell-C12.

Unfortunately, access to the on-site nuclear device was impossible, due to the destruction of the control leads between C&amp;C and the device (see attached addendum re: proposed modifications to current on-site nuclear destruct systems.)</p>\n<p>Re-establishment of communications would have a profound impact on the course of the crisis. Personnel who had, up until this point, been acting independently with varying degrees of success, could now be coordinated into an effective combat force. With the aid of Assistant Adams, the insurgent attack would be driven back, albeit not soon enough to prevent the escape of several key SCP artifacts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<blockquote>\n<p><tt>Post-recovery debriefing of Doctor Gears</tt><br/>\n<tt>(excerpt: sections 4-6)</tt></p>\n<p><em>How were you able to cross the D-9 Level after the mass failure?</em></p>\n<p>I was fortunate to be in the company of several Agents and other staff members. Due to the damage to my leg, arms and internal organs, my mobility was severely restricted. We proceeded to the emergency access tunnels in the most direct route possible. Due to SCP-item alteration and damage, however, it was impossible to take any pre-plotted routes. Several Agents and staff were attacked, harmed and killed during the progression, however we were able to attain the access point with the casualty level well below the acceptable standard.</p>\n<p><em>Were you able to observe any SCP escapes or cross-contaimination?</em></p>\n<p>I presume yes, however my ability to properly process and catalog this information was limited due to physical trauma. SCP-106 was observed in the security station and at other locations, and I would assume that its trans-dimensional nature would lead it to escape as a matter of course. One of the more obvious contaminations was that observed between SCP-682 and SCP-229. It appears that SCP-229 attempted to attack SCP-682. SCP-682 appears to have, rather then attack, integrated with SCP-229. SCP-682 appears to now be deeply integrated with the site information and electrical network. The ramifications of this have yet to be observed. More contamination is likely, but it will take more direct and controlled observation to be sure.</p>\n<p><em>Did you observe any hostile attackers over the course of the escape?</em></p>\n<p>None alive. Several corpses were observed, belonging to neither Site Staff or Agents, so it is assumed that the aggressors accessed the D-9 level by some means. One subject did cause a slight complication, however it is unclear as to whether this subject is a aggressor, SCP item, or some other designation. The subject was large, wearing a suit, gloves, and a rough cloth over its face. We were attempting to exit the main contamination area, when the subject was observed near a access panel. It turned to face our group after several Agents requested it to identify itself. As it faced us, it then reached out and removed a major fuse from the service panel, causing a majority of the hall to go dark. We were forced to backtrack a great distance to find a replacement for the damage. When we came back to the same area, the subject was gone, along with several of the corpses in the area.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Debriefing:</strong> Dr. Johannes Sorts<br/>\n<em>Excerpt from Interview conducted by O5-\u2588, regarding Dr. Sorts's involvement in Incident 234-900-Tempest Night-1</em></p>\n<p><strong>O5-\u2588:</strong> You lost control over some of the <a href=\"/scp-945\">SCP-945</a> replicas you were attempting to weaponize at various points, correct?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Sorts:</strong> I was trying to contain them, sir. I tried steer them towards destroying each other whenever I could, but it was tough using them productively. Any hostile agent they killed was soon replicated due to exposure. It's comforting knowing that the day I finally die there's going to be a clay statue showing up in my office to finish my reports, by the way.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-\u2588:</strong> We're getting off track. Where were you at 1104 when Adams regained control of communications?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Sorts:</strong> By that time I was in possession of SCP-945 itself, since it's just an old wooden box. That put me in position to almost completely account for replicas that were manifesting in the site.</p>\n<p>SCP-945 propagates itself by having the oldest replica create smaller clay figurines representing deceased individuals. These figurines are placed in the box, and a new replica appears somewhere nearby. Controlling the small figurines gave me a kill switch over every replica created due to the outbreak. I had the oldest replica accompanying me, I had the box. SCP-945 was contained.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-\u2588:</strong> Containment procedures for 945 specifically forbid breaking new figurines during a containment breach.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Sorts:</strong> [inaudible]</p>\n<p><strong>O5-\u2588:</strong> You were also observed to remove Dr. S\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's identification and coat from his body. Can you explain that?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Sorts:</strong> I'm just a level 2 memetics researcher. We get some authority in a meme-related outbreak but the \"Action Movie\" meme wasn't good enough for exercising long term control over Foundation replicas I encountered on the way down the power room. So I impersonated Dr. S\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2014 the replicas didn't know enough to tell the difference and he was level 4, so \u2026</p>\n<p><strong>O5-\u2588:</strong> Dr. S\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was one of the individuals responsible for detonating the fail-safe device in the event of a breach like this. Were you aware of that?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Sorts:</strong> No, sir. Well, I'd assume any level 4 had that authority.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-\u2588:</strong> Were you aware that Dr. S\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was also an individual exposed to SCP-945 previously?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Sorts:</strong> Well, now that you mention it, yes I do recall seeing him on the list of exposed individuals.</p>\n<p><strong>O5-\u2588:</strong> Dr. S\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was one of the first researchers we lost during the attack. He died in the explosion in the break room. Therefore it is likely that Dr. S\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's replica was one of the first to manifest. And if he was not the first, his replica would have been proceeding to the generators to detonate the fail-safe device personally given the loss of command. In accordance with his living duty, correct?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Sorts:</strong> Are you still interviewing me or\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>O5-\u2588:</strong> Did you encounter Dr. S\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 in the generator wing, or any other replica that would have been tasked with activating the fail-safe device, and did you or did you not interfere with their work?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Sorts:</strong> [inaudible]</p>\n<p><strong>O5-\u2588:</strong> Doctor Sorts, did you or did you not interfere with the activation of the fail-safe device?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Sorts:</strong> [loudly] Of course not!

Between our guys getting killed anyways and the general inaccessibility of most parts of the facility, I think only seven or eight people actually ended up surviving with their earplugs.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:</strong> I see. After you lost the remaining ear plugs, what did you do?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Vang:</strong> At that point, I decided that my best bet was to try and bust up the PA System and hope they didn't bring their own ghetto blasters or anything. Plus, after that one time with Dave, I knew a shortcut that wasn't near any of the combat zones.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:</strong> Alright. Continue.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Vang:</strong> So I manage to get down to the PA system without incident, except for this fucking\u2026 thing. It was like a dude's head got chopped off and just started moving around again, like an octopus or some shit. Needless to say, I punted that down a flight of stairs and kept going.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:</strong> What happened when you got to the control room?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Vang:</strong> The hallway was actually completely empty, and it was really quiet too, so it was actually scarier than a lot of the stuff I'd seen elsewhere. I suppose because mostly low-level personnel work there, plus there aren't any SCPs stored in that wing. Anyways, the door was open, but there was this pile of body armor just sitting in the doorway, along with a machine gun and a bunch of what looked like old pottery smashed up into bits. I ignored it, although in retrospect it would have been a good idea to at least put on the body armor.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:</strong> Go on.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Vang:</strong> Yeah, I walk in and turn towards the PA System, but instead there was this big bloody glob of flesh in its place, and some sweaty dude was working on it with a knife.

That he could operate on machines like they were people, and talked to them and whatnot.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:</strong> So what happened next?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Camera Feed 17-4e, PA System Control Room, \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>1100</strong> SCP-890 continues to operate on the mass of flesh.

No remains of the unidentified individual are visible. SCP-890 does not respond to this event.</p>\n<p><strong>1114</strong> Dr. Vang enters the room, stepping over the pile of clay. He looks towards SCP-890 and covers his mouth. He then bends over and starts shuddering.

A few questions, though. Your record doesn't show any form of formal combat training, but I looked over the tapes, and you <em>decimated</em> 890. I mean, he was an out-of-shape middle-aged guy, but still. Plus, from what you told me, you either threw up or had a panic attack pretty much every time something bad happened; but you just charged into that fight there. How on earth did you manage that?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Vang:</strong> Sir, you've read my file. You know I lived in Minneapolis, and I'm \u2588\u2588 years old, so that means I grew up in the '90s in Minneapolis. Did you know they called it \"Murderapolis\" back then? It's because of all the murders.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:</strong> Go on.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Vang:</strong> Well, I never actually got involved in any of the violence myself, but living where we did, my dad decided that I should learn how to fight, in case the situation ever came up. He was part of the resistance in Laos, real hardcore. Of course, I still got scared pretty much all the time and was a major wuss, but I figured that if it actually came down to getting in a fight, I'd be okay.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:</strong> I see.

What did you say I was infected with?</p>\n<p><strong>Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:</strong> We're not sure yet. You see, what we think happened was, the PA System was already infected with some sort of virus or worm or had something else wrong with it, and that translated over to an actual disease when 890 started operating on it. He got blood on his scalpel, and then he got the scalpel in you, so\u2026 yeah. I can't confirm this, but if your symptoms go where the doctors think they're going, you're probably gonna be classified as an SCP yourself.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Vang:</strong> Heh.

As he was actively hunting me, I hope I can be excused for thinking that it was the best idea at the time. It clearly failed to do any damage to him, of course, but I did not see him for the rest of the incident, and thank gods for that. I guess he was having fun with whatever was left of the other woman. Or maybe he found someone younger, I barely fall into the age bracket he seems to show preference.</p>\n<p><strong>Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</strong>: I see. Was it at this point that you decided to move to the cafeteria?</p>\n<p><strong>Agent Izumi</strong>: Yes, sir. I figured someone could potentially think of using it as a haven. Of course, that someone could be the hostiles, but I decided to take my chances. I could always hide somewhere else in that case. Fortunately, mister Flames was there. After showing him my badge, I entered the kitchens, found a corner and promptly fell unconscious.

It is apolitical, areligious, and asocioeconomic, made up of people from all political parties, organizations, races, and social backgrounds, forming a unity and full representation of human experience. It is of no region or culture, but all regions and cultures. To be a member of the New Freemind Nation, one must only believe in the rights of all sentient beings to those inalienable rights inaccurately and chauvinistically described as \"human\" rights.</tt></p>\n<p><tt>The Proponents of Paranormal Rights are the activist arm of the New Freemind Nation. It is beholden to no government, religion, or worldwide agenda. It has no political or religious power over it that dictates who will fight and who will die. It risks and sacrifices its life, liberty, and freedom not for its own means, but for the freedom of sentient beings cruelly oppressed and confined by the Worldwide Global Conspiracy that controls our lives from the moment of birth to the moment of death.</tt></p>\n<p><tt>We of the New Freemind Nation choose this name because it states that we are no longer willing to live under the mind-controlling rule of the insidious Worldwide Global Conspiracy that hides the truth of the world from the eyes of the people they claim to protect. We are no longer willing to allow these Conspiracies to exploit the nonhuman sentient beings of this world for their own selfish and greedy ends, nor are we willing to stand by in silence as the most inhuman purge of living creatures since the Holocaust is carried out under the noses of the mindless sheep in pasture. We of the Freemind Nation reject the quisling notions of appeasement and silent victimhood that others who claim to fight for the rights of the nonhuman sentient beings of the world espouse - silent collaborators to the murder and oppression carried out every hour of every day of every year.</tt></p>\n<p><tt>We, the united members of the Proponents of Paranormal Rights, like the brave militiamen of the American Revolution, like the Orangemen of Ireland, and the freedom fighters even now struggling together in the Middle East, refuse to go silent into that dark night. We refuse to die the death of the soul by watching the very soul of mystery in the world shackled and bound in the chains of slavery forged by the oligarchs and tyrants who rule in shadows, and refuse to act. We have struck out against the Worldwide Global Conspiracy through force of arms, and shed our blood on the field of battle alongside those whom we fight to set free.</tt></p>\n<p><tt>We of the New Freemind Nation, in the name of the inalienable rights that the United Nations claim to protect, do hereby declare war against the Worldwide Global Conspiracy in all its forms. We support by force of arms the rights of all free-minded sentient beings to exert their agency against the crushing grasp of the sinister dictators who rule the world in our name. We hereby offer our friend in brotherhood to all those who suffer - the ascendant, the witch, the mutant, the spirit, the creatures of myth and legend who live even now in ignominy and silence - and call out for them to take our hand in brotherhood, and then to take our side in the Great War for Liberation that begins on this day, in this hour, in this place.</tt></p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Transcript O5-10-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>O5-\u2588\u2588: \"The Proponents for Paranormal RIGHTS?

Initial entry into Site 17 was carried out at 1306 hours.</p>\n<p>Upon arrival, reinforcing elements discovered that the majority of the insurgents had already exfiltrated the combat zone, leaving behind seven members (who had been unable or unwilling to exfiltrate the area due to various factors). Unfortunately, this fact was compounded by the heavy number of containment breaches that took place over the course of the day, meaning that MTF personnel were required to both restore containment of escaped artifacts, while dealing with a small but dedicated core of insurgents.</p>\n<p>Due to these complications, the \"clean and sweep\" operation would take over four hours and result in several more casualties, including members of the Mobile Task Forces sent to reinforce Site 17. However, the arrival of these reinforcements would prove to be the true turning point of the incident: once the members of these MTFs arrived on the scene, the incident was, for all intents and purposes, as contained as possible, under the circumstances.</p>\n<p>In the end, recovery of basic containment at Site 17 would take another 16 hours, and result in the deaths of several more personnel. Complete site security has not yet been achieved at the time of this writing, due to the heavy number of escapes during the incident. (A list of current SCP infestations has been attached to this document as Addendum TN-4563B.)</p>\n<p>Although a large number of factors contributed to the failures during the Tempest Night incident, one key factor seems to predominate: the loss of control and communications. Due to the inability to effectively coordinate efforts, what could have been a severe but containable breach turned into multiple containment breaches of dangerous artifacts. The simple fact remains that, for a period of three hours during the incident, there was no central command authority at Site 17. Individual persons were forced to act as they saw best, with no leadership or directives to guide them.</p>\n<p>The way these persons reacted when on their own is disturbing as well. In multiple cases, individuals, believing themselves to be the only ones standing between the world and a full-on containment breach, took desperate measures in order to combat what they percieved as a deadly threat. This was compounded by the aforementioned lack of communication, which meant that incomplete and inaccurate data was provided to the persons involved. The situation has been likened to a group of desperate men lost in the wilderness and resorting to cannibalism, only to discover that they were a half-day's walk from civilization the entire time.</p>\n<p>The situation was compounded by the culture of hero-worship among the lower-ranks personnel. Every organization, over time, develops a culture and a \"mythology\" of stories about famous incidents from their history. Whether by coincidence or design, the majority of the Foundation's \"mythology\" and culture has focused on glorifying the more grandiose events from our past, as well as certain irresponsible behaviors that, thankfully, never resulted in the catastrophic consequences that could have resulted. When faced with an emergency, these persons understandably fell back to the stories that had become part of their culture, and took actions that coincided with this mindset.</p>\n<p>The results, I believe, are plain to see.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<blockquote>\n<p><tt>Recording seized from MC&amp;D courier</tt><br/>\n<em>Identity of speakers unknown at this time.</em></p>\n<p><em>Oh that is just rich\u2026the mighty Foundation, brought low by a bunch of bloody college students.</em></p>\n<p>While it is funny Mrs. Carter, the other directors and I are\u2026concerned.</p>\n<p><em>Why? It's about time those pompous twats got a nice, public black eye.</em></p>\n<p>Again, I agree, however we're concerned. These kids didn't suddenly get to be a threat without help from someone.

That does not happen. Ever.

What happens if the puppet master turns his gaze on us?</p>\n<p><em>Randal, I hardly think this-</em></p>\n<p>I know, it is unlikely\u2026but that is not even my foremost concern.

At this point, the method by which the devices were placed in the facility is unknown, as no security breaches were reported for several months before the incident. The most likely method (internal security breach) may never be proven, as any suborned personnel and/or evidence of their wrongdoing may have been destroyed in the attack.\n\n> \n\n> One explosive device, placed in Conference Room 9b, resulted in death or injury to several key senior staff members, resulting in the loss of the top three levels of site leadership. This particular device would contribute significantly to the chaos which ensued: due to the severe breakdown in the chain of command, individual Foundation personnel would be forced to respond to the attack without coordination. In most cases, they performed admirably given the situation: especially during the early moments of the attack, when the nature of the containment breach was then unknown.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n**Surveillance Log 17-CR9b-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, 0805**\n\n\n\n> **<A.

I woke up when they went off, of course.\n\n> \n\n> **Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:** What was your initial reaction?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Vang:** I just laid there a bit until the gunfire started, then I decided to report to the infirmary to get an amnestic. You see, the SCP I was working on, some of the initial tests indicate that the symptoms include auditory hallucinations. I figured an amnestic might fix it.\n\n> \n\n> **Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:** I see. Carry on.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Vang:** So, I was approaching an intersection in the hallway when I saw one of our security guards trading fire with someone I couldn't see. It dawned on me that it was all real when the top half of his head got blown up.\n\n> \n\n> **Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:** And then?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Vang:** I ran the other direction, hid in the closet, and hyperventilated for a while. When I calmed down, I ran back into the MRI lab to get my laptop.\n\n> \n\n> **Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:** Why?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Vang:** Well, I fell asleep last night before I could log out, and I had neglected to log out when I had woken up, so anyone could have gotten sensitive information off of it. Anyways, when I got back, my laptop was gone, and so was one of the desktops.\n\n> \n\n> **Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:** What was on those computers?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Vang:** I don't know about the desktop, but my laptop had some of my project files on it. Most of my projects involve abnormal memorability, so about ninety percent of it was just particularly catchy songs. In addition to that, there was a copy of the Communist Manifesto written entirely in pig latin, and there were nine variations of-\n\n> \n\n> **Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:** Anything //important//?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Vang:** Sorry, sir. One of my USBs had a minute-long clip of [[[SCP-444]]], and my laptop had a photo that makes you dizzy for a minute or so when you look at it. Those are the only things I can think of that would be of any real importance.\n\n> \n\n> **Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:** Very good. Now, back to the MRI Lab. What was your course of action?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Vang:** Well, I realized that it would be a pretty bad thing if someone attacking the site had four forty-four, considering that a good portion of //our// work with it is weaponization. I looked around, and none of the rooms around me looked like anything was stolen from them, so I figured that whoever took my computer had a good idea of what they were looking for. I heard someone coming, so I ducked into the break room.\n\n> \n\n> **Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:** What happened next?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Vang:** Whoever it was, they ran past, so I sat down and thought for a minute or so. I went to the fridge, grabbed a bottle of root beer, and broke it. To get a weapon, you know.

I had only skimmed the briefing report, but apparently that site was being re-configured as a secure site for higher-threat-level SCPs.\n\n> \n\n> **SA:** According to the logs, that security team delivered that SCP and left over 90 minutes before the incident.\n\n> \n\n> **AB:** //sighs//\n\n> \n\n> **AB:** Yes, but... well, I was talking with one of the security guards down there about some... personal matters and lost track of time. A good thing, too, or I would've been in my office when it collapsed.\n\n> \n\n> **SA:** We'll come back to that. Did you notice anything unusual before the incident?\n\n> \n\n> **AB:** I overheard one of the other guards mention that there had been a lot of SCP deliveries that day, but other than that, no. Well, until the klaxon went off, anyways. Then all the guards started scrambling for the doors into the rest of site.\n\n> \n\n> **SA:** And what did you do?\n\n> \n\n> **AB:** What any good boy scout would do: I decided to investigate the SCPs that nobody had yet bothered to pick up. Mighty careless of the researchers of those prospective projects to not collect them, but to my advantage. The first was, luckily, [[[SCP-262]]].\n\n> \n\n> **SA:** And then?\n\n> \n\n> **AB:** I went looking for guns.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n> **Debriefing: Research Assistant Harold Wachtel**\n\n> //Excerpt from interview conducted by O5-\u2588, regarding Research Assistant Harold Wachtel\u2019s involvement in Incident 234-900-Tempest Night-1.//\n\n> \n\n> **O5-\u2588:** Hello, Mr. Wachtel.

Ironically, a significant portion of the containment breaches were caused by Foundation personnel themselves, in an attempt to stop the incursion by the unknown hostile force. Secondary containment breaches followed, resulting in the Foundation-Wide Alert Status being upgraded to Red.\n\n> \n\n> The result was complete loss of situational control. Without a central coordinating authority, individual Foundation personnel were working at cross-purposes, interfering with and even counteracting each others' actions. In at least one case, a Foundation scientist's heroic sacrifice in maintaining containment of a Euclid-Class artifact was immediately rendered null and void when another Foundation researcher immediately breached containment of said artifact with the intent to use it as a weapon against the insurgent forces.\n\n> \n\n> The situation would continue until the re-establishment of intra-site communications by Secretary Adams. By that point, however, the situation had proceeded past the point of no return. Many of the SCP artifacts had broken through the site lockdown and escaped into the wild. Mission priority then changed from securing the breached artifacts to surviving the crisis.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n> **Transcript of Video Log from Storage Vault 2**\n\n> \n\n> **0810** Research Assistant Harold Wachtel enters the storage vault with SCP-494, and approaches its containment locker\n\n> \n\n> **0811:** Locker 3425-A8 explodes on the far end of the room, knocking over several shelves and dumping their contents to the floor.

Decon 6 was on the quickest path to get there.\n\n> \n\n> **SA:** How did you recognize Ms. Adams?\n\n> \n\n> **AB:** I'd seen her in the cafeteria a couple of times before, once with Director Clef, so I figured she belonged. She was headed straight for the doors into Decon, but I stopped her before she went in.\n\n> \n\n> **SA:** Why was that?\n\n> \n\n> **AB:** I'd already peeked in there and it was fucking chaos. All safe or euclid class SCPs have to go through it, even if they're well-documented, but it's only supposed to be temporary containment and the explosions must've cracked some of the walls. At least half the chamber doors were open and I saw about 8 or 10 people in what looked like riot gear, piling a ton of shit into some metal boxes. Paperwork, at least one laptop, and I think I saw a birdcage with something moving in it. Their gear didn't have any of the guards' markings on them, so I figured that they weren't part of the Foundation.\n\n> \n\n> **SA:** What did Ms. Adams do when you told her this?\n\n> \n\n> **AB:** What do you think she did? She cursed and asked if there was any other way around it.\n\n> \n\n> **SA:** Was there?\n\n> \n\n> **AB:** She obviously found one, or we wouldn't be here. I told her to follow me and we took the long way around until we got to the security station outside the Safe Humanoids wing. It took us about 20 minutes, since we had to backtrack a couple of times when we hit blocked hallways or more groups of those riot-gear guys. One time they were carrying something in a body bag that was struggling pretty fiercely.\n\n> \n\n> **SA:** Did you encounter any SCPs on your way?\n\n> \n\n> **AB:** Not that I know of. I smelled something burning a couple of times and I was told later that there was a loose SCP made of fire. And when we finally got to the security station outside the Safe Humanoids wing, we found that all the guards had been decapitated and burned. I was almost at SCP-200's chamber, so I figured that I was almost as safe as I was going to get, and pointed her down to Protective Materials. Assuming that she didn't encounter anything else, she should've been there in about 10 minutes.\n\n> \n\n> **SA:** After Ms. Adams left you, what did you do?\n\n> \n\n> **AB:** I went into the Humanoids wing. Unfortunately, it'd been pretty trashed too, although I don't know if it was from the explosions, from the invading force, or one of the escaped SCPs. I do know that when I got to SCP-200's chamber, the door was wide open and the damn cocoon was ripped to shreds. And I couldn't even hole up there because the damn handle was ripped off and the door wouldn't close.\n\n> \n\n> **SA:** Security camera footage shows that you didn't stay in the Humanoids Wing very long. If you were looking for a safe place to hole up, why did you leave?\n\n> \n\n> **AB:** Well, like I said, the place was pretty trashed, so it wasn't really any safer than the rest of the Site. Also... I kinda felt responsible for SCP-200, even though I wasn't on that project any more. I'd spent over a year studying it and if it had finally emerged, I sorta wanted to see what it was. If it was moderately harmless, I could hopefully herd it back into containment and if it wasn't... well, I figured I could at least get some observations for the next guy to review.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n**Audio Log from Hallway 34**\n\n> **Agent Lombardi:** \"Hold up. We got hostiles ahead.\"\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Vance:** \"Can we get around them?\"\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Lombardi:** \"Maybe. But they've got weapons.

Several shots were fired, but neither Agent was injured. The insurgents ran through the door after Agent Vance. Approximately thirty seconds later, several pieces of the insurgents flew out of the room, striking the opposite wall. Anomaly VN-1520 (SCP number pending) exited through the door before killing several other insurgents. It then deactivated, falling to the floor.

Perhaps unauthorized usage of SCP-914 provided a power source.\n\n> \n\n> **O5-\u2588:** Do you know exactly how 17-Gamma\u2019s containment unit was breached?\n\n> \n\n> **Huang:** No.\u00a0\u00a0I didn\u2019t even see it happen.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Maybe a stray grenade caused structural damage. But even if I had seen the breach occur, I wouldn\u2019t have understood the significance.\u00a0\u00a0I didn\u2019t know what 17-Gamma was containing.\u00a0\u00a0I didn\u2019t have the clearance.\u00a0\u00a0I assume that many others were similarly unaware.\u00a0\u00a0In the absence of a chain of command, we simply didn\u2019t know where not to go and what not to do.\n\n> \n\n> **O5-\u2588:** What happened during Containment Breach 13-34?\n\n> \n\n> **Huang:** The shockwaves were very loud, which already exacerbated the situation.\u00a0\u00a0However, that alone was not enough to cause the destruction associated with Containment Breach 13-34. I am not entirely certain, but I have my suspicions about what did.\u00a0\u00a0A piece of metal debris that resonated with a shockwave in just the right way, producing a sound quite like a bell...we all know what happened next.\u00a0\u00a0I remember an explosion of wings, and then, nothing.\u00a0\u00a0I woke up a few minutes later.\u00a0\u00a0[[[SCP-469]]] was nowhere in sight.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> \n\n> **O5-\u2588:** So Containment Breach 13-34 was the result of unfortunate coincidence?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> \n\n> **Huang:** Maybe.\u00a0\u00a0But fifty-two people died in Containment Breach 13-34.\u00a0\u00a0If you wish to attribute that to unfortunate coincidence, that\u2019s your decision, sir.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n++++ 0916 to 1103: Disorder\n\n\n\n> This period of the crisis can be considered the nadir of the incident: due to complete loss of containment and the presence of the hostile party, Foundation elements were rendered both operational and combat ineffective. Hostile elements had free reign of the facility, and many priceless artifacts were lost. The situation was further exacerbated by a complete release of D-Class personnel when confinement protocols failed. The presence of several hundred hardened criminals in this crisis situation was, to put it mildly, not optimally conducive to maintaining order.\n\n> \n\n> It is at this point that certain facts about the hostile force became evident. Firstly, the training and skill level of the hostiles were widely disparate: certain elements displayed paramilitary levels of combat and tactical expertise, while others were clearly untrained civilians. Secondly, the goal of the hostile force was not capture, but release of the contained artifacts: although some opportunistic looting took place, escaping SCP artifacts were not pursued, but allowed to escape.\n\n> \n\n> It is for this reason that I believe that the hostile force were not directed by Marshall, Carter, and Dark: MC&D would not have passed up the opportunity to retrieve several key artifacts that could have proven lucrative to their private efforts. The modus operandi is also inconsistent with the GOC or the Chaos Insurgency: Among other things, the Global Occult Coalition would have simply eradicated the entire site, while the Insurgency would not have passed up the opportunity to capture several easily weaponized artifacts for private use. Although the goals seem consistent with the group called the Serpent's Hand, the brazen nature of the attack (and the lack of SCP-class artifacts among the attackers) are not characteristic of that organization's modus operandi. Further research is required.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n**Archived email message**\n\n> //Sent: \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 10:24 GMT\n\n> From: skatz@\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.org\n\n> To: facilitiesmanager@\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.org\n\n> Re: Parking lot//\n\n> \n\n> Jerry-- when I went back to the parking lot to head back to my office in the city, my car was gone and there was just this smoking crater where my parking spot used to be.\u00a0\u00a0The car isn't the issue- it was a rental, but that was _my_ parking spot.\u00a0\u00a0You know how often I'm in and out so I am requesting that the handicapped spot next to Building C be reassigned to me.\n\n> Also, if you see Burt or Sungwoo, tell them I need a ride.\n\n> Shel \n\n> **SHELDON M.

Surveillance of experiment 966-\u2588\u2588, regarding the possibility of sapience in SCP-966 specimens.\n\n> \n\n> **Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588**: Describe what happened following the beginning of the incident.\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Izumi**: The incident began as the doors to 966 chamber were opened in order to conduct the experiment. The explosions caused a momentary malfunction of the surveillance cameras and light equipment inside the room. Showing previously unknown cognitive capacity, the four 966 specimens contained overwhelmed the security guard in the room, removed his lead-lined helmet and appeared to continuously expose him to their \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 waves for 10 seconds. As I equipped infrared goggles and entered the room in order to terminate them, the guard began to shout incoherently and shoot in all directions. I dived for cover and waited for his bullets to end. Unfortunately, this brief window of time allowed the four specimens to escape.\n\n> \n\n> **Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588**: The guard didn't hit any of them?\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Izumi**: He seems to have hit at least one, as I could see splatters and a trail of what I deduced to be blood; it is hard to tell in infrared.\n\n> \n\n> **Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588**: I see. What did you do?\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Izumi**: I locked the doors to the chamber and followed the blood trail, hoping to find and neutralize the escaped specimens. The explosions still seemed to be going off; one happened approximately 300 meters away from me. After that one, I heard a loud, inhuman scream that was suddenly cut short. Walking in its direction, I verified that two instances of 966 had been killed by the explosion.\n\n> \n\n> **Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588**: And there were no traces of the two remaining specimens?\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Izumi**: No. There were traces of something else, though.

After running out of bullets, agent Izumi proceeds to grab a rock and repeatedly hit 106's arm with it. At this point, 106 begins to slowly pull her in the direction of the wall.//\n\n> \n\n> //This proceeds for half a minute, until the agent proceeds to beat her own arm with the rock.

Unfortunately, access to the on-site nuclear device was impossible, due to the destruction of the control leads between C&C and the device (see attached addendum re: proposed modifications to current on-site nuclear destruct systems.)\n\n> \n\n> Re-establishment of communications would have a profound impact on the course of the crisis. Personnel who had, up until this point, been acting independently with varying degrees of success, could now be coordinated into an effective combat force. With the aid of Assistant Adams, the insurgent attack would be driven back, albeit not soon enough to prevent the escape of several key SCP artifacts.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n> {{Post-recovery debriefing of Doctor Gears}}\n\n> {{(excerpt: sections 4-6)}}\n\n> \n\n> //How were you able to cross the D-9 Level after the mass failure?//\n\n> \n\n> I was fortunate to be in the company of several Agents and other staff members.\u00a0\u00a0Due to the damage to my leg, arms and internal organs, my mobility was severely restricted.\u00a0\u00a0We proceeded to the emergency access tunnels in the most direct route possible.\u00a0\u00a0Due to SCP-item alteration and damage, however, it was impossible to take any pre-plotted routes.\u00a0\u00a0Several Agents and staff were attacked, harmed and killed during the progression, however we were able to attain the access point with the casualty level well below the acceptable standard.\n\n> \n\n> //Were you able to observe any SCP escapes or cross-contaimination?//\n\n> \n\n> I presume yes, however my ability to properly process and catalog this information was limited due to physical trauma.\u00a0\u00a0SCP-106 was observed in the security station and at other locations, and I would assume that its trans-dimensional nature would lead it to escape as a matter of course.\u00a0\u00a0One of the more obvious contaminations was that observed between SCP-682 and SCP-229.\u00a0\u00a0It appears that SCP-229 attempted to attack SCP-682.\u00a0\u00a0SCP-682 appears to have, rather then attack, integrated with SCP-229.\u00a0\u00a0SCP-682 appears to now be deeply integrated with the site information and electrical network.\u00a0\u00a0The ramifications of this have yet to be observed.\u00a0\u00a0More contamination is likely, but it will take more direct and controlled observation to be sure.\n\n> \n\n> //Did you observe any hostile attackers over the course of the escape?//\n\n> \n\n> None alive.\u00a0\u00a0Several corpses were observed, belonging to neither Site Staff or Agents, so it is assumed that the aggressors accessed the D-9 level by some means.\u00a0\u00a0One subject did cause a slight complication, however it is unclear as to whether this subject is a aggressor, SCP item, or some other designation.\u00a0\u00a0The subject was large, wearing a suit, gloves, and a rough cloth over its face.\u00a0\u00a0We were attempting to exit the main contamination area, when the subject was observed near a access panel.\u00a0\u00a0It turned to face our group after several Agents requested it to identify itself.\u00a0\u00a0As it faced us, it then reached out and removed a major fuse from the service panel, causing a majority of the hall to go dark.\u00a0\u00a0We were forced to backtrack a great distance to find a replacement for the damage.\u00a0\u00a0When we came back to the same area, the subject was gone, along with several of the corpses in the area.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n> **Debriefing:** Dr. Johannes Sorts\n\n> //Excerpt from Interview conducted by O5-\u2588, regarding Dr. Sorts's involvement in Incident 234-900-Tempest Night-1//\n\n> \n\n> **O5-\u2588:**\u00a0\u00a0You lost control over some of the [[[SCP-945]]] replicas you were attempting to weaponize at various points, correct?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Sorts:**\u00a0\u00a0I was trying to contain them, sir.\u00a0\u00a0I tried steer them towards destroying each other whenever I could, but it was tough using them productively.\u00a0\u00a0Any hostile agent they killed was soon replicated due to exposure.\u00a0\u00a0It's comforting knowing that the day I finally die there's going to be a clay statue showing up in my office to finish my reports, by the way.\n\n> \n\n> **O5-\u2588:** We're getting off track.\u00a0\u00a0Where were you at 1104 when Adams regained control of communications?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Sorts:**\u00a0\u00a0By that time I was in possession of SCP-945 itself, since it's just an old wooden box.\u00a0\u00a0That put me in position to almost completely account for replicas that were manifesting in the site.\n\n> \n\n> SCP-945 propagates itself by having the oldest replica create smaller clay figurines representing deceased individuals.\u00a0\u00a0These figurines are placed in the box, and a new replica appears somewhere nearby.\u00a0\u00a0Controlling the small figurines gave me a kill switch over every replica created due to the outbreak.\u00a0\u00a0I had the oldest replica accompanying me, I had the box.\u00a0\u00a0SCP-945 was contained.\n\n> \n\n> **O5-\u2588:** Containment procedures for 945 specifically forbid breaking new figurines during a containment breach.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Sorts:** [inaudible]\n\n> \n\n> **O5-\u2588:** You were also observed to remove Dr. S\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's identification and coat from his body.\u00a0\u00a0Can you explain that?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Sorts:**\u00a0\u00a0I'm just a level 2 memetics researcher.\u00a0\u00a0We get some authority in a meme-related outbreak but the \"Action Movie\" meme wasn't good enough for exercising long term control over Foundation replicas I encountered on the way down the power room.\u00a0\u00a0So I impersonated Dr. S\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 -- the replicas didn't know enough to tell the difference and he was level 4, so ...\n\n> \n\n> **O5-\u2588:** Dr. S\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was one of the individuals responsible for detonating the fail-safe device in the event of a breach like this.\u00a0\u00a0Were you aware of that?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Sorts:**\u00a0\u00a0No, sir.\u00a0\u00a0Well, I'd assume any level 4 had that authority.\n\n> \n\n> **O5-\u2588:**\u00a0\u00a0Were you aware that Dr. S\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was also an individual exposed to SCP-945 previously?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Sorts:**\u00a0\u00a0Well, now that you mention it, yes I do recall seeing him on the list of exposed individuals.\n\n> \n\n> **O5-\u2588:**\u00a0\u00a0Dr. S\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was one of the first researchers we lost during the attack.\u00a0\u00a0He died in the explosion in the break room.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore it is likely that Dr. S\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's replica was one of the first to manifest.\u00a0\u00a0And if he was not the first, his replica would have been proceeding to the generators to detonate the fail-safe device personally given the loss of command.\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with his living duty, correct?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Sorts:**\u00a0\u00a0Are you still interviewing me or--\n\n> \n\n> **O5-\u2588:**\u00a0\u00a0Did you encounter Dr. S\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 in the generator wing, or any other replica that would have been tasked with activating the fail-safe device, and did you or did you not interfere with their work?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Sorts:** [inaudible]\n\n> \n\n> **O5-\u2588:**\u00a0\u00a0Doctor Sorts, did you or did you not interfere with the activation of the fail-safe device?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Sorts:** [loudly] Of course not!\u00a0\u00a0If I had the chance to nuke my ass out of this fucking

Between our guys getting killed anyways and the general inaccessibility of most parts of the facility, I think only seven or eight people actually ended up surviving with their earplugs.\n\n> \n\n> **Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:** I see. After you lost the remaining ear plugs, what did you do?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Vang:** At that point, I decided that my best bet was to try and bust up the PA System and hope they didn't bring their own ghetto blasters or anything. Plus, after that one time with Dave, I knew a shortcut that wasn't near any of the combat zones.\n\n> \n\n> **Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:** Alright. Continue.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Vang:** So I manage to get down to the PA system without incident, except for this fucking... thing. It was like a dude's head got chopped off and just started moving around again, like an octopus or some shit. Needless to say, I punted that down a flight of stairs and kept going.\n\n> \n\n> **Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:** What happened when you got to the control room?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Vang:** The hallway was actually completely empty, and it was really quiet too, so it was actually scarier than a lot of the stuff I'd seen elsewhere. I suppose because mostly low-level personnel work there, plus there aren't any SCPs stored in that wing. Anyways, the door was open, but there was this pile of body armor just sitting in the doorway, along with a machine gun and a bunch of what looked like old pottery smashed up into bits. I ignored it, although in retrospect it would have been a good idea to at least put on the body armor.\n\n> \n\n> **Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:** Go on.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Vang:** Yeah, I walk in and turn towards the PA System, but instead there was this big bloody glob of flesh in its place, and some sweaty dude was working on it with a knife. After I had some dry heaves, I looked again and decided it was probably eight-ninety.\n\n> \n\n> **Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:** At the time, what did you know about SCP-890?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Vang:** Nothing much, really. That he could operate on machines like they were people, and talked to them and whatnot.\n\n> \n\n> **Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:** So what happened next?\n\n\n\n**Camera Feed 17-4e, PA System Control Room, \u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588**\n\n\n\n> **1100** SCP-890 continues to operate on the mass of flesh. The unidentified individual remains stationary, facing the door. Gunfire is faintly audible. Feed is stable.\n\n> \n\n> **1105** Unidentified individual appears to collapse: a large amount of what appears to be dried clay falls from various openings in the armor, and all clothing and gear fall to the ground. No remains of the unidentified individual are visible. SCP-890 does not respond to this event.\n\n> \n\n> **1114** Dr. Vang enters the room, stepping over the pile of clay. He looks towards SCP-890 and covers his mouth. He then bends over and starts shuddering. This continues for roughly a minute.\n\n> \n\n> **1115** //Dr. Vang:// \"Hey! 890!\"\n\n> \n\n> //SCP-890:// \"Shut up, I'm with a patient.\"\n\n> \n\n> **1116** Dr. Vang shoves SCP-890 forward with his hand.

I gotta say, kid. I've done a lot of things, but I never got into a knife fight with a skip. \n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Vang:** Hey, if you had told me a week ago that I'd be stabbing a surgeon with a broken bottle, I wouldn't believe it either.\n\n> \n\n> **Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:** Indeed. A few questions, though. Your record doesn't show any form of formal combat training, but I looked over the tapes, and you //decimated// 890. I mean, he was an out-of-shape middle-aged guy, but still. Plus, from what you told me, you either threw up or had a panic attack pretty much every time something bad happened; but you just charged into that fight there. How on earth did you manage that?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Vang:** Sir, you've read my file. You know I lived in Minneapolis, and I'm \u2588\u2588 years old, so that means I grew up in the '90s in Minneapolis. Did you know they called it \"Murderapolis\" back then? It's because of all the murders.\n\n> \n\n> **Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:** Go on.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Vang:** Well, I never actually got involved in any of the violence myself, but living where we did, my dad decided that I should learn how to fight, in case the situation ever came up. He was part of the resistance in Laos, real hardcore. Of course, I still got scared pretty much all the time and was a major wuss, but I figured that if it actually came down to getting in a fight, I'd be okay.\n\n> \n\n> **Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:** I see. Well, I think we can be done for today. How are you holding up?\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Vang:** Fine, I guess. Still sore, though. What did you say I was infected with?\n\n> \n\n> **Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:** We're not sure yet. You see, what we think happened was, the PA System was already infected with some sort of virus or worm or had something else wrong with it, and that translated over to an actual disease when 890 started operating on it. He got blood on his scalpel, and then he got the scalpel in you, so... yeah. I can't confirm this, but if your symptoms go where the doctors think they're going, you're probably gonna be classified as an SCP yourself.\n\n> \n\n> **Dr. Vang:** Heh. I'm probably going to be the first person ever to die of a computer virus.\n\n> \n\n> **Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:** I'm sure there are worse ways to go out.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n**Recovered Footage from Security Cameras B-298 through B-304**\n\n> **1050:** Figure identified as Dr. Wachtel enters camera range running down Hallway 12 towards Stairwell 21.\n\n> \n\n> **1051:** The door to the stairwell opens and Prof. A.

After escaping 106, what did you do?\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Izumi**: I ran back to 966 containment chamber and writhed in pain on the ground while desperately trying to make a tourniquet.\n\n> \n\n> **Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588**: ...\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Izumi**: Losing a limb made me unable to properly follow the containment breach and hostile mass attack protocols for a short while, sir.\n\n> \n\n> **Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588**: Agent.\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Izumi**: Sorry, sir. After finishing the tourniquet, which in hindsight seems unnecessary as the corrosion seemed to slow the bleeding, I decided that attempting to re-contain 106 took priority over finding the missing 966 specimens, which had most likely fled into the wild already. So I stumbled towards the dun- I mean, the Security Floor D-9, hoping to find someone that could tell me what was happening, grant me access to the place, and that could help me catch someone that was younger than me to use as lure for 106.\n\n> \n\n> **Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588**: Did you encounter hostiles while on the move?\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Izumi**: A few, yes.\n\n> \n\n> **Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588**: How did you deal with them?\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Izumi**: I hid, of course. It is what you pay me to do. Most of the time. Regardless, after some time, I found the body of Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, with the remains of a large... something... attached to his back, extending to his arm. Really odd thing.\u00a0\u00a0The hallway smelled strangely like feline urine too. Anyway, I grabbed his handgun and timed hand grenades before leaving. As I walked down the corridor, I soon felt the distinct sensation one gets when being hunted, and sure enough, I saw 106's face emerging from the end of the hallway in front of me.\n\n\n\n**Video log, Hallway 26, 27, 28: Agent Izumi J\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, unidentified woman (presumed hostile), SCP-106**\n\n\n\n> ///Transcript begins at \u2588\u2588:\u2588\u2588. Agent Izumi enters Hallway 26 on the right side. She gets to near the end of the room before suddenly stopping, turning and running out of view. Seconds later, SCP-106 appears from the north size of the corridor, stopping and phasing through the right wall after reaching the center of the room.//\n\n> \n\n> //On Hallway 27, agent Izumi is seen running and suddenly coming to a stop as the sounds of footsteps come from the opposite side of the corridor. She throws herself on the ground face up, with her remaining hand holding the handgun on her chest. Few minutes later, an unarmed, unidentified woman enters the left side of the hallway. Upon spotting agent Izumi, she immediately runs towards her, possibly in an attempt to acquire her handgun.//\n\n> \n\n> //As she gets close, agent Izumi rises and points the gun at her. Panicking, the unidentified woman tries to run. Agent Izumi shoots in her direction twice, with the second bullet hitting the left side of her hip, causing her to fall. Approaching the downed woman, agent Izumi stops for a few seconds to look at her before putting the handgun away, grabbing the woman by the back of her shirt and dragging her to the left side of the hall.//\n\n> \n\n> //On Hallway 28, agent Izumi is seem dragging the struggling woman down the corridor, stopping in front of an emergency elevator and pressing its button. As the device fails to respond, she continues to press it, with increasing alarm. After a while, she attempts to pry the doors open with her arm, to no avail.//\n\n> \n\n> //She proceeds to hit the doors twice before suddenly turning her face south. Agent Izumi quickly takes her handgun and shoots the downed woman in the legs twice, causing her to scream, before running out of view on the north size of the corridor. SCP-106 enters the hallway from the south part of the corridor, and proceeds to slowly walk towards the downed woman while dragging its arms on the walls, causing them to rot.//\n\n> \n\n> //Upon reaching her, SCP-106 [DATA EXPUNGED] slowly dragging the still living woman towards his pocket dimension. As half of her body enters the \"portal\", agent Izumi is seen quickly running towards it, placing two objects (now known to be grenades) on the body's pants, and running out of view again. 6 seconds later, there is an explosion on the hall, causing the destruction of the camera.///\n\n\n\n**Interview: Agent Izumi J\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (\"Enma Ai\")**\n\n\n\n> **Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588**: What exactly did you hope to accomplish with that?\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Izumi**: I hoped to take 106 out of action. As he was actively hunting me, I hope I can be excused for thinking that it was the best idea at the time. It clearly failed to do any damage to him, of course, but I did not see him for the rest of the incident, and thank gods for that. I guess he was having fun with whatever was left of the other woman. Or maybe he found someone younger, I barely fall into the age bracket he seems to show preference.\n\n> \n\n> **Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588**: I see. Was it at this point that you decided to move to the cafeteria?\n\n> \n\n> **Agent Izumi**: Yes, sir. I figured someone could potentially think of using it as a haven. Of course, that someone could be the hostiles, but I decided to take my chances. I could always hide somewhere else in that case. Fortunately, mister Flames was there. After showing him my badge, I entered the kitchens, found a corner and promptly fell unconscious. It was a while before I managed to wake up.\n\n> \n\n> **Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588**: I see.

The arms extending from within SCP-262 retract. \n\n> \n\n> **1122:** Massive structural failure in Junction B-132623.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n++++ 1223 to Incident Conclusion: Analysis\n\n\n\n> At approximately 1223 on the day of the attack, elements from Mobile Task Forces Omega 1 (Blackguards), Omega 2 (Silverfish), and ad-hoc elements of other available personnel arrived at Site 17. Initial entry into Site 17 was carried out at 1306 hours.\n\n> \n\n> Upon arrival, reinforcing elements discovered that the majority of the insurgents had already exfiltrated the combat zone, leaving behind seven members (who had been unable or unwilling to exfiltrate the area due to various factors). Unfortunately, this fact was compounded by the heavy number of containment breaches that took place over the course of the day, meaning that MTF personnel were required to both restore containment of escaped artifacts, while dealing with a small but dedicated core of insurgents. \n\n> \n\n> Due to these complications, the \"clean and sweep\" operation would take over four hours and result in several more casualties, including members of the Mobile Task Forces sent to reinforce Site 17. However, the arrival of these reinforcements would prove to be the true turning point of the incident: once the members of these MTFs arrived on the scene, the incident was, for all intents and purposes, as contained as possible, under the circumstances.\n\n> \n\n> In the end, recovery of basic containment at Site 17 would take another 16 hours, and result in the deaths of several more personnel. Complete site security has not yet been achieved at the time of this writing, due to the heavy number of escapes during the incident. (A list of current SCP infestations has been attached to this document as Addendum TN-4563B.)\n\n> \n\n> Although a large number of factors contributed to the failures during the Tempest Night incident, one key factor seems to predominate: the loss of control and communications. Due to the inability to effectively coordinate efforts, what could have been a severe but containable breach turned into multiple containment breaches of dangerous artifacts. The simple fact remains that, for a period of three hours during the incident, there was no central command authority at Site 17. Individual persons were forced to act as they saw best, with no leadership or directives to guide them.\n\n> \n\n> The way these persons reacted when on their own is disturbing as well. In multiple cases, individuals, believing themselves to be the only ones standing between the world and a full-on containment breach, took desperate measures in order to combat what they percieved as a deadly threat. This was compounded by the aforementioned lack of communication, which meant that incomplete and inaccurate data was provided to the persons involved. The situation has been likened to a group of desperate men lost in the wilderness and resorting to cannibalism, only to discover that they were a half-day's walk from civilization the entire time.\n\n> \n\n> The situation was compounded by the culture of hero-worship among the lower-ranks personnel. Every organization, over time, develops a culture and a \"mythology\" of stories about famous incidents from their history. Whether by coincidence or design, the majority of the Foundation's \"mythology\" and culture has focused on glorifying the more grandiose events from our past, as well as certain irresponsible behaviors that, thankfully, never resulted in the catastrophic consequences that could have resulted. When faced with an emergency, these persons understandably fell back to the stories that had become part of their culture, and took actions that coincided with this mindset.\n\n> \n\n> The results, I believe, are plain to see.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n> {{Recording seized from MC&D courier}}\n\n> //Identity of speakers unknown at this time.//\n\n> \n\n> //Oh that is just rich...the mighty Foundation, brought low by a bunch of bloody college students.//\n\n> \n\n> While it is funny Mrs. Carter, the other directors and I are...concerned.\n\n> \n\n> //Why?\u00a0\u00a0It's about time those pompous twats got a nice, public black eye.//\n\n> \n\n> Again, I agree, however we're concerned.\u00a0\u00a0These kids didn't suddenly get to be a threat without help from someone.\u00a0\u00a0They're armed up by someone who doesn't want to show their hand.\n\n> \n\n> //I suppose that's true, but we're not in any danger from it, our current ties are all covert at the moment.//\n\n> \n\n> True, but someone pulled a fast one on us.\u00a0\u00a0That does not happen.\u00a0\u00a0Ever.\u00a0\u00a0Yet somehow, someone armed this group and trained them to the point where they were able to drop a containment site totally off grid, and cripple The Foundation communication relay for a significant period of time.\u00a0\u00a0What happens if the puppet master turns his gaze on us?\n\n> \n\n> //Randal, I hardly think this-//\n\n> \n\n> I know, it is unlikely...but that is not even my foremost concern.\u00a0\u00a0Our members expect the world from us, normal reality and laws of physics be damned.\u00a0\u00a0We sometimes need those items to meet those requests.\u00a0\u00a0Which is easier, the corruption of staff and eventual theft of a item in containment, or the time, energy, lives, and most of all, money expended in the tracking, capture, containment, and study of these items?\n\n> \n\n> //...You have shown me the light, Randal.\u00a0\u00a0Cheeky, but still valid.\u00a0\u00a0I'll see if I can rouse the old fellow, get him to sign off on an open contract.\u00a0\u00a0I don't think we need to tip a hand yet, but maybe we can get those Americans...what are they, blackwood...blackburn...oh dash it, that mercenary firm...//\n\n> \n\n> Blackwater, ma'am?\n\n> \n\n> //Yes, that's it!\u00a0\u00a0I think Marshall may own the staff...or maybe that's Howard, on the board...dash it, one of the two.\u00a0\u00a0We'll get some people on the ground, keep an eye on things...if it all goes tail-up, at least we can collect a bit off the corpse before the scavengers move in.\u00a0\u00a0I think someone should post Dark anyway, keep him abreast of things.//\n\n> \n\n> I...am not sure he's alive, Mrs. Carter.\n\n> \n\n> //Fuck and bother.\u00a0\u00a0Well, let me know if he is or not when you find out, and post the letter anyway.\u00a0\u00a0He'll get it eventually.//\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n> {{Text of Message sent to O5 Council on \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588 hours after re-establishment of containment}}\n\n> \n\n> Dear Sirs or Madams,\n\n> \n\n> Given that you are unable to keep your own affairs in order, we will be cleaning up your mess for you.

A drop of blood slid down from his cracked lips from the exertion of the act. \"Who are you working for?\"\n\n\n\nJacobs remembered what Mr. Carter had told him to say. His voice was a whisper, it was a miracle he could even talk with the beating he has taken. \"Global Occult Coalition...mass liquidation of known threat entity...\"\n\n\n\n\"Liar,\" snapped Valley. Mr. Tick's hand closed around Jacobs'. He had time to look up for a moment before Mr. Tick squeezed. Jacobs screamed in agony as he heard the loud crunching from what used to be his hand. \"Who do you really work for?\"\n\n\n\nJacobs was sobbing now. The pain was unbearable. \"Marshall...Carter and Dark!\" he screamed. Mr. Tick let go.\n\n\n\nValley looked worried. \"They know of my operation here?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes.\" Jacobs struggled not to look at the crushed lump at the end of his arm.\n\n\n\n\"This is...highly unfortunate. We will have to think carefully of our next move, I think. Thank you, Mr. Jacobs. Mr. Tick, you may kill him now.\"\n\n\n\nJacobs opened his mouth to protest, but was cut short as Mr. Tick grabbed the back of his head and slammed it into the table. He was killed instantly and the table collapsed from the heavy impact. A cleaner stepped forward and began to wipe Jacobs' brain matter off the wood as two members of security threw his body off the balcony. A few seconds later, there was a far-off splash.\n\n\n\n\"Our old associates have discovered us, it seems,\" said Valley.\n\n\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Tick.\n\n\n\n\"Nevertheless, I believe we can continue our operation here. There must be some demand for those things.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\n\n\"We'll need to raise security, Mr. Tick. I don't want this happening again. I'll run out of tables.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "licensing-guide", "licensing-master-list"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "game-day", "marshall-carter-and-dark", "tale"], "title": "A Little Chat - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/gdp2-a-little-chat", "year": 2011}, "gdp2-a-working-lunch": {"created_at": "2011-10-21T16:45:00", "creator": "DrClef", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "DrClef", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drclef", "comment": "", "date": "2011-10-21T16:45:00"}, {"author": "Voct", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/voct", "comment": "sp", "date": "2011-10-22T15:50:00"}, {"author": "thedeadlymoose", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/thedeadlymoose", "comment": "Added tags: game_day, tale.

The bellman nodded and touched a control on the sixth elevator, the one that never operated except for a very select few.</p>\n<p>Though the hotel had thirty floors, there were only two buttons in this elevator.

The giant waved a scanning wand over the agent's body, frowned when the wand beeped. Harken very carefully reached into his coat pocket and pulled out his Zippo. \"Just this,\" he said, flipping the lighter open and igniting the flame. \"For my smokes.\"</p>\n<p>The giant shook his head and held out a small silver tray. Harken nodded and left his lighter behind. \"I'll want it back on my way out,\" he said, with a small smile. The giant seemed unamused.</p>\n<p>Past the doors was a dining room with white walls and marble-tiled floors. In the dining room was a cadaverously slender man dressed entirely in white. He held a silver fork and knife in his delicately fingered hands, and he was cutting into a grilled chicken breast: small, precise pieces which he transferred to his mouth and chewed with all the delicacy of a ballet dancer. There was a crystal goblet in front of him which, Harken knew, contained distilled water. Distilled water was the only thing Mister Cutridge ever drank.</p>\n<p>\"Agent Harken,\" Cutridge said, as he put down his knife and fork and patted his lips with a silk napkin. \"I was wondering when I would see you again.\"</p>\n<p>\"Cutridge,\" Harken said. He flopped down into one of the high-backed chairs and pulled out his smokes and a book of matches. \"How goes it?\"</p>\n<p>\"It continues as well as can be expected. My division is expecting to acquire some new merchandise in the near future, for which I believe I have your own people to thank.\"</p>\n<p>\"Not my division,\" Harken said, lighting up a cigarette. He took a long drag and blew a big puff of smoke into the air. \"No blood off my back. Ask me if I care.\"</p>\n<p>\"You may not care about the losses suffered by your company, but I do care about you smoking in my home. I dislike\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, bite me, Cutridge. I've had the shittiest week of my entire life. The least you can do is let me have a smoke while we shoot the shit.\" Harken took another deep drag of his cigarette and blew a smoke ring at Cutridge's face, was gratified to see the man screw up his face trying not to cough at the acrid vapors.</p>\n<p>\"Very well,\" Cutridge said, in a brittle, angry voice. \"I will allow you to indulge this once. But speak quickly and leave even more quickly. My patience is limited tonight.\"</p>\n<p>\"Then I'll make it simple. My guys have taken a hit. A HARD one. Simply put, there's blood in the water, and the sharks are circling. Now, I know you've been looking at a little warehouse downtown filled with all sorts of fun things that could make a certain Mister Cutridge very popular with his higher-ups at Marshall, Carter, and Dark. I know you've mentioned this to said bosses in the past. I want you to show some prudence. Keep your boys at home for this one. Keep quiet. Don't stir up trouble. The artifacts that got loose are fair game. Don't get greedy and try to set loose a few more.\"</p>\n<p>Mister Cutridge was quiet for a long time. \"No,\" he said, curtly.</p>\n<p>\"Seriously?

How can they expect to defend against us?\"</p>\n<p>\"Fine,\" Harken sighed. \"In that case, wait three minutes and we'll see who's arguing from a position of strength then.\"</p>\n<p>\"What?\"</p>\n<p>Harken stubbed his cigarette out onto a tea saucer. \"My smokes are laced with a nerve agent. I'm inoculated. You're not. The dose you took should be lethal in minutes.\"</p>\n<p>Cutridge's eyes bulged out, and he leaped up from his chair, knocking it over in his haste. \"GUA\u2014\"</p>\n<p>There was an explosion on the foyer. Harken smiled. \"It's amazing how much plastique you can pack into a cigarette lighter when you really try,\" he reflected.</p>\n<p>Cutridge gasped and turned purple, grabbing at his throat and making nasty wheezing noises as Harken leaned over him. The agent pulled a small vial filled with a bright blue liquid from his coat pocket. \"Now, there is an antidote,\" Harken said, \"But if you want it, you need to agree to my terms. Stay at home for this one. All right?\"</p>\n<p>Cutridge nodded. Harken handed the man the vial, and he snapped it open and swallowed the blue liquid in one gulp. Harken smiled and patted him on the face. \"See you around, Liam,\" he said.</p>\n<p>He was walking past the still-smouldering body of the big guy (slumped over the reception desk with a surprised look in his lifeless eyes) when he heard the familiar but unpleasant sound of a handgun being cocked behind him. He sighed. \"Can't let it go, huh, Liam?\" Harken said.</p>\n<p>\"Can't let you live, not when you've managed to waltz into my home and nearly murder me,\" Cutridge said, in that cold, reptilian voice. \"It's not good for business.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, I can see that,\" Harken muttered. \"People might think there was blood in the water.\"</p>\n<p>Cutridge laughed. Harken laughed too.</p>\n<p>Cutridge was still laughing when he shit himself and died.</p>\n<p>\"That was blue Kool-Aid, you asshole,\" Harken said.</p>\n<p>He tried the elevator button and was surprised to see it was still working. \"God bless the Otis company,\" he murmured. The trip down seemed very long.

Hold the fort, try to sell a few books, kay?\"</p>\n<p>\"See ya.\" Sol gave his friend a lazy wave and leaned back to watch the freaks. Most of them were clustered at the other end of the artist's alley, where the more risqu\u00e9 artists were hawking their wares. He sighed and cursed the day that James had ever convinced him that, \"We should totally do a comic together, man.\" On the whole, he would much rather be sleeping in.</p>\n<p>He was startled to realize that someone was standing at his booth, flipping through Volume 1. Her brow was furrowed, and her lips were pursed together as she scrutinized the pages. \"You are the writer?\" she asked.</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, that's me. SolKid.\"</p>\n<p>\"A strange name.\"</p>\n<p>\"It's my internet handle. My friends call me Sol. My parents call me Solomon.\"</p>\n<p>\"Mmm.\" The girl frowned and held the book up to the light, shaking her head. \"And so, this is what we've been reduced to,\" she said. \"Masturbatory fantasy fodder.\"</p>\n<p>\"It's what the people want. You gonna buy that or not?\" Sol asked.</p>\n<p>\"No,\" the girl said, putting the book back down in its wire stand. \"I think I shall give you something better.\" She smiled, revealing long, sharp canine teeth: a feral, animal grin. \"I think I shall give you something better to write about.\"</p>\n<p>It was only then that Sol realized that the girl was naked.</p>\n<p>She had vaguely Asian features: almond eyes and long straight black hair stretching to her knees. Her eyes were yellow, and their pupils were thin slits. Her fingers were tipped with sharp, hooked claws. Nine red, foxlike tails flared behind her.</p>\n<p>There was a brief hush. Everyone turned to gawk at her. A few camera flashes here and there. She stood silently, her head tilted back, eyes closed, hands clenched tightly at her sides.</p>\n<p>Then an overweight man in a red vest ran up, yelling, \"HEY HEY HEY, NONE OF THAT, THIS IS A FAMILY CONVENTION!\"</p>\n<p>Her hand flashed out as he reached to grab her, plunged into his abdomen with an unpleasant squelching sound before he even touched her, stepped aside and kicked at his shin, sending him sprawling to the ground screaming and grabbing at his spilling entrails. She opened her mouth unpleasantly wide and swallowed the gory thing clutched in her hand in a single gulp.</p>\n<p>Then the screaming started.</p>\n<p>Once, when he was a kid, Sol had taken a trip to the Holocaust museum with his high school class. They had seen an image of the inside of one of the gas chambers, where the prisoners had been executed. There were deep gouges in the walls where the desperate people had clawed at them to try and get out, places where they had trampled each other to death trying to crawl over each other to climb higher, in a blind panic. It had been terrifying enough to imagine that happening to emaciated, shaved-head prisoners in a Nazi death camp.</p>\n<p>It was even worse when happening to a bunch of brightly dressed fans at a convention.</p>\n<p>And then the madness began. He saw a skinny girl wearing cat's ears and a bodysuit screaming and pounding at a wall when an unlocked door was a few feet to her left. He saw a big, tough-looking guy wearing a black t-shirt go berserk and beat a teenage boy to death with a steel chair. A chubby girl walked up to him with empty eye sockets, her crushed eyes weeping blood and fluid. \"Maggots in my eyes, get them out, maggots in my eyes, get them out,\" she wailed.</p>\n<p>And while this happened, the girl with the yellow eyes stalked through the crowd like a shark through a school of fish: never stopping, always killing. Here she tore a man's liver out and ate it whole. There, she tore a girl's throat with her teeth. Then she was no longer eating, just killing in a berserk frenzy, screaming mad, animal cries as she curbstomped a slightly overweight guy with bad acne to death against the concession stand counter.</p>\n<p>It was the most beautiful thing Sol had ever seen.</p>\n<p>And then it was still. The doors of the hall swung back and forth on broken hinges where the panicked crowd had smashed them down in their mad, panicked exodus. A few unfortunates, trampled under the crowd, lay groaning in pain on the hard concrete floor. She stood in the center of the circle of gore, skin stained scarlet, and she looked up at the hard, stark light of the fluorescent tubes, and said, in a voice made low and harsh with anger and frustration: \"It doesn't help. Nothing helps.\"</p>\n<p>She turned to Sol, and there was murder in her eyes. \"Go write about this,\" she said.</p>\n<p>And then she left.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"And that was when I understood the truth,\" the man said. \"Just as humanity has tried to sterilize our cities of wildlife and our lives of germs, we've tried to sterilize our minds from the supernatural. The hard light of science has tried to drive the things of myth out of our lives and into the corners of the world. And just like any cornered creature, they are fighting back.\"</p>\n<p>\"While this continues, there can be no peace. The only solution is peaceful coexistence with the supernatural, as in the old days before the rise of the worldwide global scientific conspiracy, but as long as organizations like this Foundation exist, there can be no peace. For the sake of peace, they must be destroyed.\"</p>\n<p>\"The Serpent's Hand tries, but they are bound by the shackles of their own morals: they are useful to us, in a way, but they have not the will to do what needs to be done. The C.I. is content to lord over their Third World backwaters: like Mengele, they are interested only in their own grotesque experimentation. The Church is interested only in rescuing their \"Broken God\" from this Foundation. Only we of the Freemind Nation are willing to put our lives on the line for the sake of peace.\"</p>\n<p>\"Will you help us?\"</p>\n<p>The man stared intently at the girl sitting across the table. She had vaguely Asian features: almond eyes and long straight black hair stretching to her knees. Her eyes were yellow, and their pupils were thin slits. Her fingers were tipped with sharp, hooked claws, which she tapped against the hardwood table, where a plate with a liver from a freshly slaughtered, grass-fed, organically raised cow lay on a clean white plate. Nine red, foxlike tails flared behind her in a peacock's fan of swaying reddish fur.</p>\n<p>She reached out one hand and, without a word, swallowed the gory chunk of meat in front of her in one gulp.</p>\n<p>The man smiled. \"Let me tell you about our plan, then\u2026\"</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/gdp2-and-then-i-saw-the-light\">Game Day Phase 2: \". . .

I know you were directly involved, and for the record, let's just assume I'm not an idiot and know you're guilty. So, with that, how about we try and make this much easier. What I want to know is this: who is it you work for?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Alright. Let me put it this way, then. What is this Foundation that you work for?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe managed to recover a lot of documentation from that case. You're no idealist, gun-for-hire hack, you've got dispatches, mission parameters\u2026 this looks really, really bad, friend. Like, terrorist bad. Do you know what happens to terrorists these days? We can say there was an\u2026 accident in transport, and drop you down the darkest hole you've ever seen. You'll never s\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have no idea what a dark hole is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally? Why don't you enlighten me then, tough guy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you ever seen someone turn in to vapor? Not pulped by an explosion or anything, but real vapor. Just atomize over the space of a few seconds, screaming all the while? I've had to shoot people who I've shared lunch with, bummed smokes from, because they had a kind of eel inside them that was eating their nervous system from the inside out and turning them in to a plague-spreading serial rapist. I've sat for weeks in a sealed cell with no outside human contact, wondering if I'd start showing bumps on my skin, which would mean a long, slow degeneration into something lower than an animal. If you're going to scare me, you're going to need to step up your game from a little recreational waterboarding.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you tal-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNone of you get it. I told you, right at the start, you need to turn me loose. I'm not a toy that anyone is going to leave just laying around. You've taken something that doesn't belong to you, Special Agent Danbury, and you've taken it from someone who does not share well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAhh, I see, friends in high places and everything? You're not the first one to try that\u2026 cry to me about such and such connection, this and that thing you can make happen with one phone call. Wanna know the thing about that? I don't care. You're not dealing with some pig-fucking local beat cop. I'm not bound by anything as silly as a code of conduct. My job is to keep my country safe. Period. Everything else is secondary to that, including your well-being and humane treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs I said, you'll need to step it up a bit. It's been too long, which means they've decided not to play it overly nice\u2026 you might want to pick that up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you\u2026 thought I turned this off. Hold on you little shit, i'm not nearly done with you. This is Agent Danbury, you shouAAGGG\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat's the\u2026 oh shit, what's the word\u2026 mem-something. It's a sound or an image that can make your brain shit itself, then die. Can never remember the name. Can you hear me still?

It's definitely a target of interest, but it's not really fitting any of the preset profiles as yet. We're expanding our search parameters.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy is it wearing a bag on its head?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, we're also not sure about that\u2026 we can't compel it to remove it, and attempting to do so by force has\u2026 not gone well. It's otherwise rather compliant, so we've left it alone for now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI see. Now, the most obvious question is why am I looking at a big, bag-headed freak who's sitting at a table and not lying on a slab?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, indeed\u2026 well, that's the thing. You see, we were following a lead on the fox-girl thing, and ran in to a couple of targets trying to flee the city. Happy accident, really\u2026 anyway, as we went to intercept, this big guy shows up, and starts attacking them. It was weird, though\u2026 this thing, whatever it is, is obviously extremely strong, but all he did was bash them up\u2026 then just stood there, waiting for us to intercept. I ordered Rodriguez to put a couple rounds through the big guy's bag head, but he missed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRodriguez doesn't miss.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know sir. He was pretty upset about it. He double-tapped first, then mag-dumped. Every one of them missed just by a hair. I'm not really sure how, the big guy didn't seems to really move or anything. Anyway, we moved in and secured the scene, tried to restrain the remaining target. He kept holding up his hands, nodding his head. He\u2026 it was trying to surrender, I think. Hopkins tried to put restraints on him. He got his wrist broken. After that, we decided to just go with it for the time being.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this one of the Foundation strays?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo sir, at least not one that we have any record of. We're combing the database now, but other then a vague surveillance hit from about four years ago, there's been nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right\u2026so it's big, strong, and somewhat docile, ignoring the personal space issues. Again, why hasn't it been shot or gassed yet, and why did I need to come down here in person?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOk, here's the thing\u2026 it can't, or won't, talk. It has to touch someone to communicate with anything other than hand gestures and body language. It's\u2026not fun for the one being touched\u2026but they apparently can see\u2026something, some sort of image or language or something that is some kind of communication. It's not a direct translation, but the gist of it gets across. We thought he was attacking someone for a second, and they looked half-dead, b\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOut with it, man!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2026ah\u2026knows where the Library is, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026The Library. As in THE Library? As in KTE-7909-Alexandria?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes sir. He's an exile, or a escapee, or some such, we're not entirely sure yet, but whatever it is, he's kicked out and not allowed back. However, there's something important there that he wants, and he's willing to show us how to get there, if we help him get it back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don't actually intend\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh no sir, not at all\u2026 but this is a unique opportunity, to say the very least. Once he shows the initial strike team the way, we can dispose of him, then roll the main force right in to the nest. No more nibbling the edges, scraping off little corners\u2026 right to the heart, a direct punch to the very core.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is some fine work, captain. How soon can you get a team ready?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt's already on standby, sir\u2026 we're\u2026 ahh\u2026 just waiting for the native guide, so to speak.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy is he just sitting there, looking at the sky like that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe said something about the sun. We're not sure what, but he was insistent that we wait.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want progress reports every hour, on the hour, understood? Keep the team on Ready Two. The moment you're ready to jump, begin the operation on your own discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"Oh, and one last thing, Captain. This is real wilderness country you're walking into. Aside from rumors, we have no knowledge of the Library whatsoever. Expect anything, prepare for everything. You're authorized to escalate up to Response Five if necessary to complete the mission or extract your team. Is that clear?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. The boys will be happy to hear that.\"</p>\n<p>\"Don't be. Just because we're letting you use ray guns doesn't mean this is going to be easy. You're heading straight into the Wild West here. You'll need all the gear you can get just to survive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<p>Mr. Dark had settled into his office at the New York Club with a minimum of pain and suffering on all sides. It lacked the character of The Museum, but with a few homey touches, the odd bunyip-hide rug and Olmec knives, it felt almost right.</p>\n<p>Cheryl brought him a short stack of newspaper entries, gleaned from a pile of papers nationwide. Mr. Dark browsed it with and chuckled, drinking thick, oily coffee. Authorities were debating whether Boomer\u2019s work was a terrorist bomb gone off by accident, or a clandestine meth lab run by someone who had failed Chemistry 101. Even if Harken had escaped, he'd surely gotten the point. Several of them, most likely\u2026</p>\n<p>He read further, about a \u201cperson of interest\u201d followed by a surprisingly accurate sketch and description of Boomer. That was going to be a problem. Boomer was too sweet a lad to lose to the wolves of the law, and not the sort to stand up to any kind of serious interrogation. He scribbled a note to have him replanted a good distance away\u2026 assuming anyone could uproot him with a minimum of explosions. Bah, other people's problems.</p>\n<p>At least he had gotten started on acquisitions. The disease-controlling girl was safely tucked away in Facility B, and Willard was already starting to teach her the benefits of cooperation. When breaking in any bitch, canine or sapien, it was always best to start with positive reinforcement. Fine food, lodgings, shiny things, and an admirable parade of strapping lads had her in amicable spirits. For now. He knew her type very well, she'd soon want more, and more\u2026 and she'd get it. The anal electrical probe had the amazing ability to enact dramatic and rapid attitude change. He could have started that way, yes, but he adored watching the loving care people took when constructing their own gallows.</p>\n<p>The kumiho was going to be more of a problem. She\u2019d been spotted with her associates, and he knew them well enough: that lot of mystical (and mythical) riff-raff from The Library. She had to be there\u2026 he picked absently at the chip in his canine. Perhaps a visit would be in order? No reason not to, really\u2026 it'd been ages, and he could check on a few matters as well. He chuckled deep in his throat, tapping his foot on the slick bunyip hide. No matter how furious they might be over The Museum, they had to let him visit The Library. Rules were rules. The very idea of that impotent, boiling rage was reason enough, really.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Percival looked up from his book and over to the cat sitting on the chair. She licked her paw languidly, pointedly ignoring the sound of approaching boots. She looked up at Percival with a slow, sleepy wink. \u201cVisitors. Unfriendly ones, I believe.\u201d Before he could ask, she promptly curled up, stuffed her head under her ribs, and started snoring.</p>\n<p>The three men entered in a clump of boots and the soft tap of wingtip shoes. A short, grinning man flanked by two human bulldogs, armed to the teeth. The short one had some kind of long coat, with thick, frayed cuffs and collars\u2026 or some kind of very thick fur. The thick sleeves and slight tilt of his head gave the impression of some old, threadbare bird of prey. The other two were all business, looking somewhere between cops and soldiers\u2026but with an oozing aura of pure menace.</p>\n<p>Weapons were drawn before anyone could say a word. Swords, sickle, crystal rod, machine guns and massive pistols were quickly pointing across the short gap between the three men and the small collection of Library residents, all aimed at areas of the body both tender and vital. The short man smiled with the slimy, cloying self-satisfaction of a ice cream man passing out treats dipped in arsenic.</p>\n<p>She stayed in the back of the room, not sure whether to duck, or laugh. It was the most ludicrous standoff She had ever seen, but could turn ugly in an instant; She wasn't sure what She wanted to see happen more. Fear and tension radiated off the group like the heat from sun-baked mass graves. Except for the short man. He smelled of spice, and oil, and moss\u2026 and something that made her nose twitch and tendons tighten like piano wire.</p>\n<p>He waved away the thick blade hanging inches from his nose like it was a butterfly intruding on a morning walk. \u201cNow is there really call for all this, sweethearts? I'm just here to renew my library card\u2026and tarry a bit with that sweet little thing perched up on the pillows there.\u201d</p>\n<p>He gestured to the bespectacled girl with a wink and a waggle of his fingers. She could barely decide whether to growl or blush. She ended up doing both.</p>\n<p>The standoff was broken by a low cough.</p>\n<p>\"If I were you, I would put those weapons away,\" Percival said. He was standing between both groups with his empty hands held out to the sides, looking back and forth between them with an expression of utter calm.</p>\n<p>\"You can't take us all,\" one of the big bodyguards snarled.</p>\n<p>\"I don't intend to,\" Percival said firmly. \"The Library will do it for me. I'm just trying to prevent a tragedy.\"</p>\n<p>He looked up at the second floor balcony, where a large number of black-shrouded figures were looking down at the tableau below. More of them were coming out from the shadows, gathering around the scene in a broad circle\u2026 just waiting. Watching.</p>\n<p>One by one, the weapons were put away, and one by one, the faceless guardians of the Library disappeared back into the shadows from whence they had come. Percival turned to the three men in black suits and nodded. \"Carry on,\" he said, \"but remember where you are.\"</p>\n<p>\"Of course,\" Dark said, \"My apologies for the rudeness and short-sightedness of my companions, sir knight.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm not a knight,\" Percival said, dismissively. He turned away and picked up the longsword he had left leaning against the wall, then walked back into the stacks.</p>\n<p>The small man brushed a small piece of lint off his shoulder then walked to the back of the room, where a rather nondescript, mousy-looking girl was looking up at him from behind several large stacks of very old, rather dusty books. \"May I sit down, dearie?\"</p>\n<p>\"If you wish,\" She replied, in a sundew-sweet voice.</p>\n<p>One of the big thugs pulled out the chair for the short man, who sat down with all the grace of a stalking heron. \"Allow me to introduce myself,\" he said. \"My name is Dark, of Marshall, Carter, and Dark, Limited.\"</p>\n<p>\"Never heard of you,\" She lied.</p>\n<p>\"Good,\" Dark said. \"I spend a lot of bloody time, energy and money making sure that's the case. I, on the other hand, have heard of you. The last kumiho. Your work at that\u2026 convention\u2026 was exquisite. From an artistic standpoint.\"</p>\n<p>\"You are a fan of the arts, then?\"</p>\n<p>\"I am a patron of the arts,\" Dark corrected. \"And I wish to be yours.\"</p>\n<p>\"Interesting. Tell me more,\" She said, leaning back in Her chair and steepling Her fingers.</p>\n<p>\"Then I'll get to the point sweetheart. Simply put, I am a provider. I provide wondrous things to those who have the money, resources and sensibilities to truly appreciate them. I can sate any desire, quench any thirst, and one of the things my associates desire is you. In exchange, I can do the same for you. You can live like a queen in perfect decadence. You will hunt prey beyond any imagining. You can kill to your heart's content, and instead of being vilified, you will be applauded. Congratulated, even.\"</p>\n<p>\"And a whore as well, I suppose,\" She said.</p>\n<p>He grinned devlishly. \"On occasion, yes. But then again, I don't think prudishness is a vice you possess in great measure, is it, sweetheart?\"</p>\n<p>\"Hmm. A generous offer. But if I refuse?\"</p>\n<p>\"In that case, we call in the hounds and run you to the ground. The end result is the same. The process, however, is not nearly as pleasant for you. For me, however\u2026 well\u2026 it's been years since my last fox hunt,\" Dark said with an almost apologetic smile.</p>\n<p>\"How very honest,\" She said dryly. \"Allow me to repay you in kind. I have had a better offer.\"</p>\n<p>\"What, from those idiots who broke you out? Small fry. Useless. They can't help or protect you.\"</p>\n<p>\"Not from them,\" She said. \"From their Teacher.\"</p>\n<p>\"A raving lunatic who's read too much Karl Marx,\" Dark said dismissively. \"You'll get no help from him.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hm,\" She gave an enigmatic smile, then stood up and turned to walk away.</p>\n<p>Something about her expression immediately raised Dark's hackles. That girl was far too smug not to be hiding something\u2026 \"Wait,\" he snarled, the playful carelessness dropping from his voice like a discarded coat. \"What do you know? What are you not telling me?\"</p>\n<p>\"Do the amaryllis flowers still bloom in Elysium?\" She asked.</p>\n<p>The chair clattered to the floor as Dark leaped to his feet. She allowed herself a moment of satisfaction at the shock in his wide, pale eyes. \"He's alive?\" the short man hissed.</p>\n<p>\"Despite your best efforts, yes,\" She said.</p>\n<p>\"And he's still planning to go through with it?\"</p>\n<p>\"Of course.\"</p>\n<p>\"I see,\" Mister Dark said. \"Simon?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, boss?\"</p>\n<p>\"Kill her.\"</p>\n<p>Simon acted reflexively: the gun was in his hand before he knew he had drawn it, and he'd fired before he was aware he'd been given the order, even as his eyes widened in horror at what he was doing. The bullets passed harmlessly through the smiling girl and blasted some holes through the bookshelf behind her. A moment later, the illusion flickered and vanished, a small, tattered leaf falling to the floor.</p>\n<p>A moment after that, three black-hooded figures appeared from the darkness and lunged towards the big man. Simon screamed and turned to shoot, but one of the Guardians casually broke his arm and then grabbed him by his shattered wrist. By the time his brother Johan had gotten to his feet, Simon had vanished, dragged into the shadows by the sinister cloaked figures.</p>\n<p>\"Clever girl,\" Dark sighed, rubbing his temple. He hadn't expected it would work, but it was worth a shot.</p>\n<p>He turned and started walking out of the library quickly but easily, ignoring the stares and frightened looks the other library denizens were giving him. \"Boss,\" Johan said. \"We gotta go get Simon! We can't let them\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"Didn't you hear a goddamn word of what I told you on the trip here? If your brother's not dead already, he's one of THEM now. The Library always collects\u2026 and they're always in need of librarians. We're leaving.\"</p>\n<p>\"But boss\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"You're fired,\" Dark snapped. \"Fuck off and die.\"</p>\n<p>He turned away from the big bodyguard, ignoring the stunned look on his face as the man reactively drew the pistol from his coat pocket and put it in his mouth. He threw open the double doors as the gunshot rang out behind him. A twist of time and space later, Dark re-emerged in a back alley in Chicago, with a large black luxury car parked among the refuse and graffiti. The chauffeur gave him a surprised look, then shrugged. \"Where are Simon and Johan?\" he asked.</p>\n<p>\"Their services are no longer needed,\" Dark growled. \"Now drive.\"</p>\n<p>He picked up the gold-plated car phone and started dialing. \"Willard? This is Dark. Fast-track the bitch. I want her ready by sunset tomorrow\u2026 what? Then LET her break! We'll put her back together eventually, I need her ready as soon as possible! What? No, I will NOT explain myself, just get to work!\"</p>\n<p>He slammed the phone down vengefully, then quickly dialed a second number. \"Marshall, Carter? This is Dark. Yes, I know what time it is over there, I don't give a shit\u2014 no, I don't care what you were in the middle of, tell them to wait. The Fourth Partner is alive.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's right,\" Dark continued. \"The fucking altruist\u2026 and he's still trying to carry out his fucking revolution. I need all available assets under my control immediately\u2026 no, I don't need your help, I need your fucking resources! You two nitwits work on keeping the client\u00e8le safe. What? I don't fucking care. Make something up.\"</p>\n<p>Dark slammed the handset down and fumed silently, glaring at the phone. Blind, stupid, helpless louts\u2026and now even more time drained to deal with everything on a direct, personal level, it was all so\u2026uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>He picked his chipped canine, glaring out the window, as the car slid though the streets like a V-8 powered serpent. Worthless, all of it, and all to no purpose, by all rights he should throw the whole mess in the fire, and cultivate more, instead of trying to control all of this by\u2026</p>\n<p>Mr. Dark froze for eight seconds, then slowly smiled a grin as slow and keen as a stiletto in the night.</p>\n<p>Of course. Of course\u2026The little vixen would reach out, insecure despite her posturing, but to more\u2026 intrinsic aid. Lunatics too blind or single-minded to see the danger\u2026 and in so doing, they'd force the next round, wouldn't they? When the children keep acting up, Daddy will eventually start cracking heads\u2026 and oh my, weren't they acting up now?</p>\n<p>He chuckled softly, comfortable again, leaning into the plush seats. Unexpected, unplanned for, and perhaps dangerous, yes\u2026 but if he was anything, he was a man who loved a good, bloody streetfight.</p>\n<p>If it just happened to take place between massive groups of well trained men and women, so much the better.</p>\n<hr/>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Global Memo</strong><br/>\n<strong>From: 05-9</strong><br/>\n<strong>To: All 05 and Level 4 command staff</strong><br/>\n<strong>Re: CONTROL</strong><br/>\n<strong>CC: Central Records, F.O.B. command datahubs</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My dear ladies and gentlemen,</p>\n<p>I understand that this has been a trying time, to say the least.

Just atomize over the space of a few seconds, screaming all the while? I've had to shoot people who I've shared lunch with, bummed smokes from, because they had a kind of eel inside them that was eating their nervous system from the inside out and turning them in to a plague-spreading serial rapist. I've sat for weeks in a sealed cell with no outside human contact, wondering if I'd start showing bumps on my skin, which would mean a long, slow degeneration into something lower than an animal.

It's definitely a target of interest, but it's not really fitting any of the preset profiles as yet. We're expanding our search parameters.\u201d\n\n> \n\n> \u201cWhy is it wearing a bag on its head?\u201d\n\n> \n\n> \u201cAh, we're also not sure about that\u2026 we can't compel it to remove it, and attempting to do so by force has\u2026 not gone well. It's otherwise rather compliant, so we've left it alone for now.\u201d\n\n> \n\n> \u201cI see. Now, the most obvious question is why am I looking at a big, bag-headed freak who's sitting at a table and not lying on a slab?\u201d\n\n> \n\n> \u201cYes, indeed\u2026 well, that's the thing. You see, we were following a lead on the fox-girl thing, and ran in to a couple of targets trying to flee the city. Happy accident, really... anyway, as we went to intercept, this big guy shows up, and starts attacking them. It was weird, though\u2026 this thing, whatever it is, is obviously extremely strong, but all he did was bash them up\u2026 then just stood there, waiting for us to intercept. I ordered Rodriguez to put a couple rounds through the big guy's bag head, but he missed.\u201d\n\n> \n\n> \u201cRodriguez doesn't miss.\u201d\n\n> \n\n> \u201cI know sir. He was pretty upset about it. He double-tapped first, then mag-dumped. Every one of them missed just by a hair. I'm not really sure how, the big guy didn't seems to really move or anything. Anyway, we moved in and secured the scene, tried to restrain the remaining target. He kept holding up his hands, nodding his head. He\u2026 it was trying to surrender, I think. Hopkins tried to put restraints on him. He got his wrist broken. After that, we decided to just go with it for the time being.\u201d\n\n> \n\n> \u201cIs this one of the Foundation strays?\u201d\n\n> \n\n> \u201cNo sir, at least not one that we have any record of. We're combing the database now, but other then a vague surveillance hit from about four years ago, there's been nothing.\u201d\n\n> \n\n> \u201cAll right\u2026so it's big, strong, and somewhat docile, ignoring the personal space issues. Again, why hasn't it been shot or gassed yet, and why did I need to come down here in person?\u201d\n\n> \n\n> \u201cOk, here's the thing\u2026 it can't, or won't, talk. It has to touch someone to communicate with anything other than hand gestures and body language. It's\u2026not fun for the one being touched\u2026but they apparently can see\u2026something, some sort of image or language or something that is some kind of communication. It's not a direct translation, but the gist of it gets across. We thought he was attacking someone for a second, and they looked half-dead, b--\u201d\n\n> \n\n> \u201cOut with it, man!\u201d\n\n> \n\n> \u201cHe\u2026ah\u2026knows where the Library is, sir.\u201d\n\n> \n\n> \u201c\u2026The Library. As in THE Library? As in KTE-7909-Alexandria?\u201d\n\n> \n\n> \u201cYes sir. He's an exile, or a escapee, or some such, we're not entirely sure yet, but whatever it is, he's kicked out and not allowed back. However, there's something important there that he wants, and he's willing to show us how to get there, if we help him get it back.\u201d\n\n> \n\n> \u201cYou don't actually intend\u2026\u201d\n\n> \n\n> \u201cOh no sir, not at all\u2026 but this is a unique opportunity, to say the very least. Once he shows the initial strike team the way, we can dispose of him, then roll the main force right in to the nest. No more nibbling the edges, scraping off little corners\u2026 right to the heart, a direct punch to the very core.\u201d\n\n> \n\n> \u201cThis is some fine work, captain. How soon can you get a team ready?\u201d\n\n> \n\n> \u201cIt's already on standby, sir\u2026 we're\u2026 ahh\u2026 just waiting for the native guide, so to speak.\u201d\n\n> \n\n> \u201cWhy is he just sitting there, looking at the sky like that?\u201d\n\n> \n\n> \u201cHe said something about the sun. We're not sure what, but he was insistent that we wait.\u201d\n\n> \n\n> \u201cI want progress reports every hour, on the hour, understood? Keep the team on Ready Two. The moment you're ready to jump, begin the operation on your own discretion.\u201d\n\n> \n\n> \u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\n> \n\n> \"Oh, and one last thing, Captain. This is real wilderness country you're walking into. Aside from rumors, we have no knowledge of the Library whatsoever. Expect anything, prepare for everything. You're authorized to escalate up to Response Five if necessary to complete the mission or extract your team. Is that clear?\"\n\n> \n\n> \"Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. The boys will be happy to hear that.\"\n\n> \n\n> \"Don't be. Just because we're letting you use ray guns doesn't mean this is going to be easy. You're heading straight into the Wild West here. You'll need all the gear you can get just to survive.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nMr. Dark had settled into his office at the New York Club with a minimum of pain and suffering on all sides. It lacked the character of The Museum, but with a few homey touches, the odd bunyip-hide rug and Olmec knives, it felt almost right. \n\n\n\nCheryl brought him a short stack of newspaper entries, gleaned from a pile of papers nationwide. Mr. Dark browsed it with and chuckled, drinking thick, oily coffee. Authorities were debating whether Boomer\u2019s work was a terrorist bomb gone off by accident, or a clandestine meth lab run by someone who had failed Chemistry 101. Even if Harken had escaped, he'd surely gotten the point. Several of them, most likely\u2026\n\n\n\nHe read further, about a \u201cperson of interest\u201d followed by a surprisingly accurate sketch and description of Boomer. That was going to be a problem. Boomer was too sweet a lad to lose to the wolves of the law, and not the sort to stand up to any kind of serious interrogation. He scribbled a note to have him replanted a good distance away\u2026 assuming anyone could uproot him with a minimum of explosions. Bah, other people's problems.\n\n\n\nAt least he had gotten started on acquisitions. The disease-controlling girl was safely tucked away in Facility B, and Willard was already starting to teach her the benefits of cooperation. When breaking in any bitch, canine or sapien, it was always best to start with positive reinforcement. Fine food, lodgings, shiny things, and an admirable parade of strapping lads had her in amicable spirits. For now. He knew her type very well, she'd soon want more, and more\u2026 and she'd get it. The anal electrical probe had the amazing ability to enact dramatic and rapid attitude change. He could have started that way, yes, but he adored watching the loving care people took when constructing their own gallows.\n\n\n\nThe kumiho was going to be more of a problem. She\u2019d been spotted with her associates, and he knew them well enough: that lot of mystical (and mythical) riff-raff from The Library. She had to be there\u2026 he picked absently at the chip in his canine. Perhaps a visit would be in order? No reason not to, really\u2026 it'd been ages, and he could check on a few matters as well. He chuckled deep in his throat, tapping his foot on the slick bunyip hide. No matter how furious they might be over The Museum, they had to let him visit The Library. Rules were rules. The very idea of that impotent, boiling rage was reason enough, really.\n\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nPercival looked up from his book and over to the cat sitting on the chair. She licked her paw languidly, pointedly ignoring the sound of approaching boots. She looked up at Percival with a slow, sleepy wink. \u201cVisitors. Unfriendly ones, I believe.\u201d Before he could ask, she promptly curled up, stuffed her head under her ribs, and started snoring.\n\n\n\nThe three men entered in a clump of boots and the soft tap of wingtip shoes. A short, grinning man flanked by two human bulldogs, armed to the teeth. The short one had some kind of long coat, with thick, frayed cuffs and collars\u2026 or some kind of very thick fur. The thick sleeves and slight tilt of his head gave the impression of some old, threadbare bird of prey. The other two were all business, looking somewhere between cops and soldiers\u2026but with an oozing aura of pure menace.\n\n\n\nWeapons were drawn before anyone could say a word. Swords, sickle, crystal rod, machine guns and massive pistols were quickly pointing across the short gap between the three men and the small collection of Library residents, all aimed at areas of the body both tender and vital. The short man smiled with the slimy, cloying self-satisfaction of a ice cream man passing out treats dipped in arsenic.\n\n\n\nShe stayed in the back of the room, not sure whether to duck, or laugh. It was the most ludicrous standoff She had ever seen, but could turn ugly in an instant; She wasn't sure what She wanted to see happen more. Fear and tension radiated off the group like the heat from sun-baked mass graves. Except for the short man. He smelled of spice, and oil, and moss... and something that made her nose twitch and tendons tighten like piano wire. \n\n\n\nHe waved away the thick blade hanging inches from his nose like it was a butterfly intruding on a morning walk. \u201cNow is there really call for all this, sweethearts? I'm just here to renew my library card\u2026and tarry a bit with that sweet little thing perched up on the pillows there.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe gestured to the bespectacled girl with a wink and a waggle of his fingers. She could barely decide whether to growl or blush. She ended up doing both.\n\n\n\nThe standoff was broken by a low cough.\n\n\n\n\"If I were you, I would put those weapons away,\" Percival said. He was standing between both groups with his empty hands held out to the sides, looking back and forth between them with an expression of utter calm.\n\n\n\n\"You can't take us all,\" one of the big bodyguards snarled.\n\n\n\n\"I don't intend to,\" Percival said firmly. \"The Library will do it for me. I'm just trying to prevent a tragedy.\"\n\n\n\nHe looked up at the second floor balcony, where a large number of black-shrouded figures were looking down at the tableau below. More of them were coming out from the shadows, gathering around the scene in a broad circle\u2026 just waiting. Watching.\n\n\n\nOne by one, the weapons were put away, and one by one, the faceless guardians of the Library disappeared back into the shadows from whence they had come. Percival turned to the three men in black suits and nodded. \"Carry on,\" he said, \"but remember where you are.\"\n\n\n\n\"Of course,\" Dark said, \"My apologies for the rudeness and short-sightedness of my companions, sir knight.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm not a knight,\" Percival said, dismissively. He turned away and picked up the longsword he had left leaning against the wall, then walked back into the stacks.\n\n\n\nThe small man brushed a small piece of lint off his shoulder then walked to the back of the room, where a rather nondescript, mousy-looking girl was looking up at him from behind several large stacks of very old, rather dusty books. \"May I sit down, dearie?\"\n\n\n\n\"If you wish,\" She replied, in a sundew-sweet voice.\n\n\n\nOne of the big thugs pulled out the chair for the short man, who sat down with all the grace of a stalking heron. \"Allow me to introduce myself,\" he said. \"My name is Dark, of Marshall, Carter, and Dark, Limited.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Never heard of you,\" She lied.\n\n\n\n\"Good,\" Dark said. \"I spend a lot of bloody time, energy and money making sure that's the case. I, on the other hand, have heard of you. The last kumiho. Your work at that\u2026 convention\u2026 was exquisite. From an artistic standpoint.\"\n\n\n\n\"You are a fan of the arts, then?\"\n\n\n\n\"I am a patron of the arts,\" Dark corrected. \"And I wish to be yours.\"\n\n\n\n\"Interesting. Tell me more,\" She said, leaning back in Her chair and steepling Her fingers.\n\n\n\n\"Then I'll get to the point sweetheart. Simply put, I am a provider. I provide wondrous things to those who have the money, resources and sensibilities to truly appreciate them. I can sate any desire, quench any thirst, and one of the things my associates desire is you. In exchange, I can do the same for you. You can live like a queen in perfect decadence. You will hunt prey beyond any imagining. You can kill to your heart's content, and instead of being vilified, you will be applauded.\u00a0\u00a0Congratulated, even.\"\n\n\n\n\"And a whore as well, I suppose,\" She said.\n\n\n\nHe grinned devlishly. \"On occasion, yes. But then again, I don't think prudishness is a vice you possess in great measure, is it, sweetheart?\"\n\n\n\n\"Hmm. A generous offer. But if I refuse?\"\n\n\n\n\"In that case, we call in the hounds and run you to the ground. The end result is the same. The process, however, is not nearly as pleasant for you. For me, however\u2026 well\u2026 it's been years since my last fox hunt,\" Dark said with an almost apologetic smile.\n\n\n\n\"How very honest,\" She said dryly. \"Allow me to repay you in kind. I have had a better offer.\"\n\n\n\n\"What, from those idiots who broke you out? Small fry. Useless. They can't help or protect you.\"\n\n\n\n\"Not from them,\" She said. \"From their Teacher.\"\n\n\n\n\"A raving lunatic who's read too much Karl Marx,\" Dark said dismissively. \"You'll get no help from him.\"\n\n\n\n\"Hm,\" She gave an enigmatic smile, then stood up and turned to walk away. \n\n\n\nSomething about her expression immediately raised Dark's hackles. That girl was far too smug not to be hiding something... \"Wait,\" he snarled, the playful carelessness dropping from his voice like a discarded coat. \"What do you know? What are you not telling me?\"\n\n\n\n\"Do the amaryllis flowers still bloom in Elysium?\" She asked.\n\n\n\nThe chair clattered to the floor as Dark leaped to his feet. She allowed herself a moment of satisfaction at the shock in his wide, pale eyes. \"He's alive?\" the short man hissed.\n\n\n\n\"Despite your best efforts, yes,\" She said.\n\n\n\n\"And he's still planning to go through with it?\"\n\n\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\n\n\"I see,\" Mister Dark said. \"Simon?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes, boss?\"\n\n\n\n\"Kill her.\"\n\n\n\nSimon acted reflexively: the gun was in his hand before he knew he had drawn it, and he'd fired before he was aware he'd been given the order, even as his eyes widened in horror at what he was doing. The bullets passed harmlessly through the smiling girl and blasted some holes through the bookshelf behind her. A moment later, the illusion flickered and vanished, a small, tattered leaf falling to the floor.\n\n\n\nA moment after that, three black-hooded figures appeared from the darkness and lunged towards the big man. Simon screamed and turned to shoot, but one of the Guardians casually broke his arm and then grabbed him by his shattered wrist. By the time his brother Johan had gotten to his feet, Simon had vanished, dragged into the shadows by the sinister cloaked figures. \n\n\n\n\"Clever girl,\" Dark sighed, rubbing his temple. He hadn't expected it would work, but it was worth a shot. \n\n\n\nHe turned and started walking out of the library quickly but easily, ignoring the stares and frightened looks the other library denizens were giving him. \"Boss,\" Johan said. \"We gotta go get Simon! We can't let them\u2026\"\n\n\n\n\"Didn't you hear a goddamn word of what I told you on the trip here? If your brother's not dead already, he's one of THEM now. The Library always collects\u2026 and they're always in need of librarians. We're leaving.\"\n\n\n\n\"But boss\u2026\"\n\n\n\n\"You're fired,\" Dark snapped. \"Fuck off and die.\"\n\n\n\nHe turned away from the big bodyguard, ignoring the stunned look on his face as the man reactively drew the pistol from his coat pocket and put it in his mouth. He threw open the double doors as the gunshot rang out behind him. A twist of time and space later, Dark re-emerged in a back alley in Chicago, with a large black luxury car parked among the refuse and graffiti. The chauffeur gave him a surprised look, then shrugged. \"Where are Simon and Johan?\" he asked.\n\n\n\n\"Their services are no longer needed,\" Dark growled. \"Now drive.\"\n\n\n\nHe picked up the gold-plated car phone and started dialing. \"Willard? This is Dark. Fast-track the bitch. I want her ready by sunset tomorrow\u2026 what? Then LET her break! We'll put her back together eventually, I need her ready as soon as possible! What? No, I will NOT explain myself, just get to work!\"\n\n\n\nHe slammed the phone down vengefully, then quickly dialed a second number. \"Marshall, Carter? This is Dark. Yes, I know what time it is over there, I don't give a shit\u2014 no, I don't care what you were in the middle of, tell them to wait. The Fourth Partner is alive.\"\n\n\n\n\"That's right,\" Dark continued. \"The fucking altruist\u2026 and he's still trying to carry out his fucking revolution. I need all available assets under my control immediately\u2026 no, I don't need your help, I need your fucking resources! You two nitwits work on keeping the client\u00e8le safe. What? I don't fucking care. Make something up.\"\n\n\n\nDark slammed the handset down and fumed silently, glaring at the phone. Blind, stupid, helpless louts\u2026and now even more time drained to deal with everything on a direct, personal level, it was all so\u2026uncomfortable. \n\n\n\nHe picked his chipped canine, glaring out the window, as the car slid though the streets like a V-8 powered serpent. Worthless, all of it, and all to no purpose, by all rights he should throw the whole mess in the fire, and cultivate more, instead of trying to control all of this by\u2026\n\n\n\nMr. Dark froze for eight seconds, then slowly smiled a grin as slow and keen as a stiletto in the night.\n\n\n\nOf course. Of course\u2026The little vixen would reach out, insecure despite her posturing, but to more\u2026 intrinsic aid. Lunatics too blind or single-minded to see the danger\u2026 and in so doing, they'd force the next round, wouldn't they? When the children keep acting up, Daddy will eventually start cracking heads\u2026 and oh my, weren't they acting up now?\n\n\n\nHe chuckled softly, comfortable again, leaning into the plush seats. Unexpected, unplanned for, and perhaps dangerous, yes\u2026 but if he was anything, he was a man who loved a good, bloody streetfight.\n\n\n\nIf it just happened to take place between massive groups of well trained men and women, so much the better.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n> **Global Memo**\n\n> **From: 05-9**\n\n> **To: All 05 and Level 4 command staff**\n\n> **Re: CONTROL**\n\n> **CC: Central Records, F.O.B. command datahubs**\n\n> \n\n>> My dear ladies and gentlemen,\n\n>> \n\n>> I understand that this has been a trying time, to say the least.

It was mostly a quiet life, leaning more towards cold and flu than major trauma. Even the local methamphetamine manufacturers tended to avoid going to the doctor for as long as they could, generally paranoid that they would get reported to the police. Shakti took her patients' privacy seriously, though, and reassured the manufacturer and addict in front of her of that.</p>\n<p>\"Mr. Jameson, you don't have to worry. I keep your records strictly sealed and private. I obviously think that your health would stop deteriorating if you would stop using meth, but I won't report you to Sheriff Michaels. Now please, tell me what's wrong.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well\u2026 if you say so. I'm still not saying that I use meth, just so you know, but if I did, how could I quit it? Um\u2026 I wanted to know if you could do anything about my chest hurting all the time. And maybe how to put on some more weight. He thinks that I'm too skinny and sick and need to put on some weight.\"</p>\n<p>\"If you <em>were</em> using meth, I would suggest going down to Forrester and checking into the rehab program at the hospital there. It's in-patient and lasts at least 30 days, and they would help you with the withdrawal symptoms. If you were taking meth, of course.\"</p>\n<p>Dr. Shivaji continued speaking as she listened to Bill's chest and heart.</p>\n<p>\"As for the chest pain, your heart sounds a little weak. I'd like to get an EKG and chest X-ray on you and possibly send you down to the hospital for a CT scan later this week, so I can get a better picture of your heart. You should know, however, that if there are any problems with your heart that he probably won't pick you. He really only chooses people in tip-top shape. Still, any effort to improve your health will be a good thing, even if you might not be his.\"</p>\n<p>Dr. Shivaji slung her stethoscope around her neck as she finished the exam.</p>\n<p>\"The nurse will be in in a few minutes to take you to get your X-ray. And remember: if you did do meth, continuing will only make things worse, and he wouldn't like that.\"</p>\n<p>Bill hung his head like a little boy getting reprimanded and replied, \"I know, I know. And, um, could you get me that information about the rehab? I really don't want to disappoint him.\"</p>\n<p>Shakti left the room and gave the instruction to her nurse, then went to write up her notes. As she typed them into the computer, she idly thought, <em>\"I really ought to go visit him myself this weekend. I wish he would choose me too, but I know he thinks we still need a doctor for now. And he says that the first of the children will be almost ready for their next stage soon. I should see about ordering some more beds for them.\"</em></p>\n<hr/>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dear Diary,</p>\n<p>Mr. All-Growd-Up is thinking at me a lot today. He thinks I'm going to be ready soon. He says I won't be scared. But I think I will be.</p>\n<p>I'm going to miss Mommy and Daddy and Beth. But not Uncle Dan. He looks at me funny sometimes. I don't like it.</p>\n<p>And i forgot that Beth is going to be ready soon too. Mr. All-Growd-Up thinks at us that her and Tommy and Dani will be first.</p>\n<p>They're lucky they can go first. I bet they will be real pretty like Mr. All-Growd-Up. I hope I'm pretty too.</p>\n<p>I want to take Scooter with me when i go. He's a good cat. But Mr. All-Growd-Up thinks I can't. He thinks I can have Scooter when I grow up if I want. So that's good. I hope I get Uncle Dan like that too.</p>\n<p>Bye!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<p>Sheriff Brett Michaels (<em>\"Yes, like the rocker.\"</em>) was worried. He'd been feeling strange lately and wasn't sure what it was. Lately he'd go on patrol in some of the farther parts of the county for a few hours and would start feeling really angry and afraid of something, although when he was feeling better he couldn't remember what, exactly. He'd come racing back to Spring, all fired up to do something, charge straight into the clearing that the adult usually appeared in and then he'd feel a lot better. The air always smelled\u2026 <em>better</em> around the adult. Everything just felt right around him, like he could take care of everything. Even Sheriff Michaels, the nominal authority in the county, deferred to the judgment of the adult.

And how did Mary do on her cheerleader tryouts?\n\n> \n\n> I did want to get some advice from you, though. Beth's going through some kind of phase and I was hoping that you might have soem experience from when your kids were younger. Beth's spending a lot of time by herself and just acts like she's starving all the time. I swear that she's put on 15 pounds in the last month. Do you think she might have an eating disorder or something? I mean, she's only 10, that kind of stuff doesn't happen until they're older, right?

It was mostly a quiet life, leaning more towards cold and flu than major trauma. Even the local methamphetamine manufacturers tended to avoid going to the doctor for as long as they could, generally paranoid that they would get reported to the police. Shakti took her patients' privacy seriously, though, and reassured the manufacturer and addict in front of her of that.\n\n\n\n\"Mr. Jameson, you don't have to worry. I keep your records strictly sealed and private. I obviously think that your health would stop deteriorating if you would stop using meth, but I won't report you to Sheriff Michaels. Now please, tell me what's wrong.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well... if you say so. I'm still not saying that I use meth, just so you know, but if I did, how could I quit it? Um... I wanted to know if you could do anything about my chest hurting all the time. And maybe how to put on some more weight. He thinks that I'm too skinny and sick and need to put on some weight.\"\n\n\n\n\"If you //were// using meth, I would suggest going down to Forrester and checking into the rehab program at the hospital there. It's in-patient and lasts at least 30 days, and they would help you with the withdrawal symptoms. If you were taking meth, of course.\"\n\n\n\nDr. Shivaji continued speaking as she listened to Bill's chest and heart.\n\n\n\n\"As for the chest pain, your heart sounds a little weak. I'd like to get an EKG and chest X-ray on you and possibly send you down to the hospital for a CT scan later this week, so I can get a better picture of your heart. You should know, however, that if there are any problems with your heart that he probably won't pick you. He really only chooses people in tip-top shape. Still, any effort to improve your health will be a good thing, even if you might not be his.\"\n\n\n\nDr. Shivaji slung her stethoscope around her neck as she finished the exam.\n\n\n\n\"The nurse will be in in a few minutes to take you to get your X-ray. And remember: if you did do meth, continuing will only make things worse, and he wouldn't like that.\"\n\n\n\nBill hung his head like a little boy getting reprimanded and replied, \"I know, I know. And, um, could you get me that information about the rehab? I really don't want to disappoint him.\"\n\n\n\nShakti left the room and gave the instruction to her nurse, then went to write up her notes. As she typed them into the computer, she idly thought, //\"I really ought to go visit him myself this weekend. I wish he would choose me too, but I know he thinks we still need a doctor for now. And he says that the first of the children will be almost ready for their next stage soon. I should see about ordering some more beds for them.\"//\n\n-----\n\n> Dear Diary,\n\n> \n\n> Mr. All-Growd-Up is thinking at me a lot today. He thinks I'm going to be ready soon. He says I won't be scared. But I think I will be.\n\n> \n\n> I'm going to miss Mommy and Daddy and Beth. But not Uncle Dan. He looks at me funny sometimes. I don't like it.\n\n> \n\n> And i forgot that Beth is going to be ready soon too. Mr. All-Growd-Up thinks at us that her and Tommy and Dani will be first.\n\n> \n\n> They're lucky they can go first. I bet they will be real pretty like Mr. All-Growd-Up. I hope I'm pretty too.\n\n> \n\n> I want to take Scooter with me when i go. He's a good cat. But Mr. All-Growd-Up thinks I can't. He thinks I can have Scooter when I grow up if I want. So that's good. I hope I get Uncle Dan like that too.\n\n> \n\n> Bye!\n\n-----\n\nSheriff Brett Michaels (//\"Yes, like the rocker.\"//) was worried. He'd been feeling strange lately and wasn't sure what it was. Lately he'd go on patrol in some of the farther parts of the county for a few hours and would start feeling really angry and afraid of something, although when he was feeling better he couldn't remember what, exactly. He'd come racing back to Spring, all fired up to do something, charge straight into the clearing that the adult usually appeared in and then he'd feel a lot better. The air always smelled... //better// around the adult. Everything just felt right around him, like he could take care of everything. Even Sheriff Michaels, the nominal authority in the county, deferred to the judgment of the adult. He knew best, after all.\n\n\n\nBrett spotted Dr. Shivaji across the clearing while the rest of the crowd was getting set up for the choosing and decided that he'd talk with her afterwards and see if she could give him some medicine or something to calm him down.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, he kept his hands firmly on the shoulders of his brother Jake and his sister-in-law Debra. Their boy Jacob stood in front of the three of them, looking a little nervous. But that was only to be expected for meeting the adult for the first time; it was a big moment in anyone's life, and Jacob was about the age that the adult was interested in helping.\n\n\n\nHe told his brother and sister-in-law, \"You ought to be proud.

Besides, you're not gonna get anywhere so long as I have the keys to the truck.\"\n\n\n\nDebra kept glaring at Brett, her fists clenching and unclenching as she tried to figure out the best way to incapacitate him non-lethally.

A <em>tick-tock</em> came from over the radio. Then, Mr. Tick spoke.</p>\n<p>\"Yes. It is ready. Sir.\" He said in that monotone voice of his.</p>\n<p>\"How long?\"</p>\n<p>Another few seconds passed. \"Now.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"Beta-23, move in.\"</p>\n<p>The six members of Mobile Task Force Beta-23 rushed forward, taking cover positions and looking for viable targets in the small cottage they had been tasked with clearing. They were not yet in there, however, and were still cautious of the enemy firing out of its windows.</p>\n<p>Which of course, was the least of their worries. The commander, unnoticed by the rest of his team, gasped in agony as what he thought was the grass of the field injected its paralytic venom into him. He would die last, as Marshall, Carter, and Dark's intruder prevention item was not yet hungry.</p>\n<p>The man at the back of the group flicked his eyes back and forth, checking for targets. He stepped on something as he moved slowly forwards. His gaze flicked down to the photograph for only a second, but that was all it needed. He quietly and politely knelt down and cut his own throat.</p>\n<p>The others turned around swiftly, having heard their fallen comrades' last gurgles. Two of them aimed their rifles at the absurd image of a stitch moving through the grass like a snake. Two stitches, three stitches. Their bullets did nothing as the stitches moved over them, joining them together, merging lungs and hearts and brains.</p>\n<p>One stayed, one ran.</p>\n<p>The one who had stayed stepped back, then winced and looked down. A small dart was stuck right in his knee. Shaking, he pulled it out. It was barbed. Was it poisonous? Would he die slowly, in agony?</p>\n<p>As he looked down and saw two maggots repairing his wound, he knew he would not die at all.</p>\n<p>The one who had ran carried on running, panic carrying him when his own strength failed. Soon, his frantic running was joined by the purposeful slam of four paws on the ground. Paws that were running towards him very quickly. A voice came from behind him, a horrible growl of a voice. He dared not look.</p>\n<p>\"Sunny in Harare,\" it said.</p>\n<p>He panted. Would he make it to the extraction zone?</p>\n<p>\"Mild in Miami,\" it growled.</p>\n<p>He was almost at the fence. Come on, almost!</p>\n<p>\"Rainy in London!\" screamed the voice, and the hound pounced.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"All went well,\" tocked Mr. Tick. Of course, Valley knew this from the multiple television screens in front of his bed, but Mr. Tick was always a redundant sort of fellow.</p>\n<p>Valley smiled. He was dying, of course, but that was no reason not to have fun. He had to do it again soon.</p>\n<p>\"Make another batch,\" he rasped into the radio. \"Make them think they're gocks this time.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes. Sir.\"</p>\n<p>The door opened and <strong>a man</strong> stepped in. If you were asked to describe him afterwards, that was all you could say, he was just <strong>a man</strong>. The illogical colours of his jacket, the jagged curves of his pupils and the impossible pattern on his badge made sure of that.</p>\n<p>\"You called me,\" smiled <strong>the man</strong> that had walked in. Its eyes flicked from radio to sky, sky to table, table to Valley in a few seconds. \"You're dying?\" <strong>the man</strong> asked curiously, his voice a dull monotone.</p>\n<p>\"Of course I am,\" Valley said bitterly. \"Mr. Carter's parting gift.\"</p>\n<p>\"You called me,\" said <strong>the man</strong> again. \"What is it you wanted?\"</p>\n<p>Valley shifted uncomfortably in his bed and stared into what he hoped were <strong>the man</strong>'s eyes. \"I am a sick old man, friend.\"</p>\n<p>\"I am not your friend. Yes, you are. Why do you want to see me?\" said <strong>the man</strong> patiently, its voice quick, as if he was eager to be somewhere else.</p>\n<p>Valley leaned forward, his eyes shining with excitement. \"I need to expand, but what I have is too limited. The few products I managed to steal before leaving Carter's lovely club are not enough. I need the Station, please. You must help me have it.\"</p>\n<p>One of <strong>the man</strong>'s eyes drifted to the ceiling. The other one circled in its socket. It was in deep concentration.</p>\n<p>\"I will need four men. Your best four men.\"</p>\n<p>\"And money?\"</p>\n<p>A look of confusion crossed <strong>the man</strong>'s face. \"I will not need money. I will need four men. Goodbye, Mr. Valley.\" It walked out of the door and it shut the door behind him.</p>\n<p>A few seconds passed. Valley leaned back, looked at the thin stump that had yesterday been his arm, and cried.</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/gdp2-fun\">Fun</a>\" by Tanhony, from the <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

They were not yet in there, however, and were still cautious of the enemy firing out of its windows.\n\n\n\nWhich of course, was the least of their worries. The commander, unnoticed by the rest of his team, gasped in agony as what he thought was the grass of the field injected its paralytic venom into him. He would die last, as Marshall, Carter, and Dark's intruder prevention item was not yet hungry.\n\n\n\nThe man at the back of the group flicked his eyes back and forth, checking for targets. He stepped on something as he moved slowly forwards. His gaze flicked down to the photograph for only a second, but that was all it needed. He quietly and politely knelt down and cut his own throat.\n\n\n\nThe others turned around swiftly, having heard their fallen comrades' last gurgles. Two of them aimed their rifles at the absurd image of a stitch moving through the grass like a snake. Two stitches, three stitches. Their bullets did nothing as the stitches moved over them, joining them together, merging lungs and hearts and brains. \n\n\n\nOne stayed, one ran.\n\n\n\nThe one who had stayed stepped back, then winced and looked down. A small dart was stuck right in his knee. Shaking, he pulled it out. It was barbed. Was it poisonous? Would he die slowly, in agony?\n\n\n\nAs he looked down and saw two maggots repairing his wound, he knew he would not die at all.\n\n\n\nThe one who had ran carried on running, panic carrying him when his own strength failed. Soon, his frantic running was joined by the purposeful slam of four paws on the ground. Paws that were running towards him very quickly. A voice came from behind him, a horrible growl of a voice. He dared not look.\n\n\n\n\"Sunny in Harare,\" it said.\n\n\n\nHe panted. Would he make it to the extraction zone?\n\n\n\n\"Mild in Miami,\" it growled.\n\n\n\nHe was almost at the fence. Come on, almost!\n\n\n\n\"Rainy in London!\" screamed the voice, and the hound pounced.\n\n\n\n-------------\n\n\n\n\"All went well,\" tocked Mr. Tick. Of course, Valley knew this from the multiple television screens in front of his bed, but Mr. Tick was always a redundant sort of fellow.\n\n\n\nValley smiled. He was dying, of course, but that was no reason not to have fun. He had to do it again soon.\n\n\n\n\"Make another batch,\" he rasped into the radio. \"Make them think they're gocks this time.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes. Sir.\"\n\n\n\nThe door opened and **a man** stepped in. If you were asked to describe him afterwards, that was all you could say, he was just **a man**. The illogical colours of his jacket, the jagged curves of his pupils and the impossible pattern on his badge made sure of that.\n\n\n\n\"You called me,\" smiled **the man** that had walked in. Its eyes flicked from radio to sky, sky to table, table to Valley in a few seconds. \"You're dying?\" **the man** asked curiously, his voice a dull monotone.\n\n\n\n\"Of course I am,\" Valley said bitterly. \"Mr. Carter's parting gift.\"\n\n\n\n\"You called me,\" said **the man** again. \"What is it you wanted?\"\n\n\n\nValley shifted uncomfortably in his bed and stared into what he hoped were **the man**'s eyes. \"I am a sick old man, friend.\"\n\n\n\n\"I am not your friend. Yes, you are. Why do you want to see me?\" said **the man** patiently, its voice quick, as if he was eager to be somewhere else.\n\n\n\nValley leaned forward, his eyes shining with excitement. \"I need to expand, but what I have is too limited. The few products I managed to steal before leaving Carter's lovely club are not enough. I need the Station, please. You must help me have it.\"\n\n\n\nOne of **the man**'s eyes drifted to the ceiling. The other one circled in its socket. It was in deep concentration.\n\n\n\n\"I will need four men. Your best four men.\"\n\n\n\n\"And money?\"\n\n\n\nA look of confusion crossed **the man**'s face. \"I will not need money. I will need four men. Goodbye, Mr. Valley.\" It walked out of the door and it shut the door behind him. \n\n\n\nA few seconds passed. Valley leaned back, looked at the thin stump that had yesterday been his arm, and cried.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "licensing-guide", "licensing-master-list"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "game-day", "tale"], "title": "Fun - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/gdp2-fun", "year": 2011}, "gdp2-looking-at-the-world-from-a-different-angle": {"created_at": "2011-11-15T03:22:00", "creator": "DrClef", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "DrClef", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drclef", "comment": "", "date": "2011-11-15T03:22:00"}, {"author": "DrClef", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drclef", "comment": "", "date": "2011-11-15T03:26:00"}, {"author": "DrClef", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drclef", "comment": "", "date": "2011-11-15T06:24:00"}, {"author": "DrClef", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drclef", "comment": "", "date": "2011-11-15T16:46:00"}, {"author": "DrClef", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drclef", "comment": "", "date": "2011-11-15T16:53:00"}, {"author": "DrClef", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drclef", "comment": "", "date": "2011-11-15T21:18:00"}, {"author": "DrClef", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drclef", "comment": "", "date": "2011-11-15T21:21:00"}, {"author": "DrClef", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drclef", "comment": "", "date": "2011-11-16T17:34:00"}, {"author": "DrClef", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drclef", "comment": "", "date": "2011-12-02T18:34:00"}, {"author": "thedeadlymoose", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/thedeadlymoose", "comment": "Added tags: game_day, tale.

You're on your own, dear.\"</p>\n<p>\"What's the matter, hun? Scared of a little women's underwear?\"</p>\n<p>\"Not scared, just uncomfortable. It's the way those clerks look at you, like I'm crashing some stranger's party.\"</p>\n<p>\"You could help me pick something out for\u2026 later,\" Deb smirked.</p>\n<p>Tom smiled and kissed her forehead. \"As it turns out, I love surprises.\"</p>\n<p>\"Fine,\" Deb huffed in mock anger. \"I'll just go alone, then. See you in a bit?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, sure, I'll be around. Call my cell when you're done.\"</p>\n<p>\"Sure thing. See ya, hun.\"</p>\n<p>Tom headed into the bookstore first and flipped through the best sellers on the front rack. When that grew dull, he headed over to the Brookstone to take a look at some needlessly complicated grilling tools and lay down on the Tempur-Pedic mattress. Around the time he was picking up a pretzel with nacho cheese sauce, he started to wonder how long Deb was going to be looking at bras, anyway.</p>\n<p>He was in the process of tucking the little white paper bag into his teeth to pull out his cell phone and call when the first shot was fired. At first, it sounded like firecrackers, but then he heard the shouting and saw the men and the guns. There were two groups of them, shouting and running around, hiding behind the white ceramic planters and tipped-over tables in the food court. One of them tried to move from behind a table to behind the counter of the Orange Julius: he fell down about halfway there, clutching his leg, then his head exploded in a spray of red and grey that splattered across the white tile floor.</p>\n<p>Tom realized then that he was huddled behind one of the big white planters, his cell phone clutched in his hand in a white-knuckle grip. He'd lost his pretzel at some point: he could see the little brown twist of bread smeared across the tiled floor, little yellow footprints leading away where someone had stomped on his small plastic cup of cheese sauce while running away from the gunfight.</p>\n<p>It was surreal. Things like this were supposed to happen in downtown Detroit or South Central Los Angeles, not in a Westfield Shopping Center in the Midwestern suburbs. There was a lot of shouting (mostly involving the word \"motherfucker,\") then there was a big boom, and a lot of smoke, and the shooting stopped.</p>\n<p>Tom saw a big black man in a brown leather jacket, holding a small gun: it looked like a toy in his big meaty fist. Some men in grey uniforms ran up, then, and the man in the brown leather jacket slowly put down his gun and lay down on the ground with his hands on his head. Tom didn't wait to see what happened next: the moment the cops got the guy, he ran down the escalator and started running towards the Victoria's Secret, shouting Debra's name.</p>\n<p>She met him outside, and they fell into each other's arms, holding each other tight, as if they would never let go.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"I felt so useless,\" Tom confessed that night, after the cops and the reporters and the much-needed shower. \"All that was going on\u2026 and all I could think of was to hide.\"</p>\n<p>\"What could you do?\" Deb asked. She was curled up in his arms and was resting her head on his chest.</p>\n<p>\"I don't know,\" Tom admitted. \"But I felt like I should have done something.\"</p>\n<p>Deb kissed him, and he kissed her back, and then they took each others' clothes off and let things go from there.</p>\n<p>Two weeks later, Deb announced she'd missed her period.</p>\n<p>Sixteen years later, they told their horribly embarassed daughter why her full name was Jennifer Victoria Firefight Nathan.</p>\n<p>Seeing his daughter groan in horror as her younger brother made snarky comments and her boyfriend look on in jaw-dropped awe, Tom thought back to that afternoon in the shopping mall, and laughed. It was funny, he thought, how things tend to work out in the end.</p>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">+\u00a0A\u00a0Closer\u00a0Look</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">-\u00a0Stepping\u00a0Back</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<h1 id=\"toc1\"><span>A Closer look</span></h1>\n<p><em>Gunshot, 9mm, double-tap,</em> Jeff thought, as the first couple of cracks rang out. It was a sound that didn't belong in a shopping mall at 2 in the afternoon.</p>\n<p>He dropped the big plastic bag and reached under his leather jacket for his concealed carry weapon. He checked the slide and the ejection port: both looked clear, and took off the safety. \"Lie down on the ground and cover your heads!\" he shouted to the other shoppers. \"Wait here!\"</p>\n<p>He headed towards the sound of the gunfire, keeping his head low and the muzzle of his gun pointed at the ground. He glanced around the corner leading to the food court, and saw a bunch of knocked-over tables and some guys shooting at each other.</p>\n<p>Jeff blinked in surprise: these weren't gangers. Gangers tended to stand up and run around holding their guns out in front of them: they usually relied on mass volume of fire, and they usually took a few shots then ran for it before the cops showed up. What they didn't do was set up lanes of fire, use cover, and coordinate their attacks. Especially coordinate their attacks.</p>\n<p>\"Center Peel, fall back to the counters, go!\" someone shouted. \"Peel one!\" A rapid fusillade of pistol fire rang out, followed by two guys trying to fall back to the food counters. One of them made it, the second took a round in the knee and fell. Jeff saw one of the guys crouched behind the planters take a deliberate double tap and shoot the wounded enemy in the head, killing him.</p>\n<p>Jeff's blood ran cold. He'd been a Marine in two tours overseas before retiring: that and six years in the force meant he'd spent just about half his life around guns and gunfighters in some fashion or another, and those fourteen years of experience were telling him that these guys were trained professionals: possibly Special Forces of some sort. Now that he knew what to look for, the lines of their clothing seemed strangely bulky in places: did they have body armor under their jackets and jeans? The small-caliber pistol in his hands suddenly felt very inadequate.</p>\n<p>Then one of the motherfuckers in the food court jumped up holding a small, stubby black tube, and suddenly things went all the way bad.</p>\n<p>Jeff didn't wait to see what happened next. \"GRENADE!\" he screamed. He ducked back around the corner, dropped to the ground, put his hands over his ears, closed his eyes, opened his mouth. The explosion felt like a full body punch to the gut. There were a few more shots, and then a lot of shouting. Jeff shook his head to clear his fuzzy vision and got back to his feet.</p>\n<p>The carnage was incredible. Everyone on the planters side of the firefight was dead or dying. In the food court, he saw the guy with the grenade launcher lying dead on the ground with a bullet in his head. There was another guy standing over him, holding a submachinegun of some sort. \"GET ON THE GROUND, MOTHERFUCKER!\" Jeff shouted. The word \"motherfucker\" was very important in these cases: it let the guy know who was in fucking charge here.</p>\n<p>He swept his eyes over the perp's body: eyes, face, hands\u2026</p>\n<p>Hands.</p>\n<p>When the perp turned to face him, he saw the guy's hands start to come up, holding his little submachinegun, so Jeff put two in his chest and one in his head. It was done before his heart beat once.</p>\n<p>The guy fell down and sprawled on the bloody and broken mall floor like a discarded doll. Jeff swallowed hard. It wasn't the first time he'd fired his gun at another human being, but all his fighting in the sandbox had been at long range, shooting his .50 cal at houses from the next sand dune over. He was sure he'd killed some people in his time in the Marines, but this was the first time he'd been close enough to touch the guy as he died. Seeing the light leave the guy's eyes from this close-up\u2026</p>\n<p>\"GET DOWN ON THE FUCKING GROUND RIGHT THE FUCK NOW!\" someone screamed, and Jeff winced inwardly. He was suddenly very aware that he was a big black man with a gun standing in the middle of a bunch of dead guys. He very carefully put his pistol down on the ground and slid it into the corner, then lay down in a puddle of sticky wet nastiness and put his hands on his head.</p>\n<p>Someone ran up to him and put a knee in the small of his back. \"Check my inside left coat pocket,\" Jeff said, slowly and calmly.</p>\n<p>\"SHUT THE FUCK UP, ASSHOLE! DON'T SAY A FUCKING WORD!\" the guy screamed.</p>\n<p>\"Brad?\" an older, wiser voice said. \"Check his fucking coat pocket already before you say something really dumb.\"</p>\n<p>Trembling hands reached into his leather jacket pocket and fumbled out the wallet from his jacket. A few moments later, the pressure on his back let up, and someone reached a hand down to help him to his feet. Jeff looked up into the face of a big, balding white guy with an impressive red beard, wearing a light grey rent-a-cop outfit.</p>\n<p>\"Officer,\" the guard said.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"Holy crap, Jeff, you look like hell,\" Captain McCoy sighed. \"I thought this was supposed to be your day off.\"</p>\n<p>\"You know me, sir,\" Jeff said, smiling weakly. \"I like to take my work home with me.\"</p>\n<p>\"Nobody likes a workaholic, Jeff. Did you give your statement yet?\"</p>\n<p>\"Rog took it down a few minutes ago,\" Jeff admitted. \"I'm just waiting for someone to tell me I can leave.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, then, consider this an order: go home. Get some rest. Don't bother coming in tomorrow, you can have the day off. But don't leave town either, just in case someone needs to talk to you. Kay?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, sir,\" Jeff sighed.</p>\n<p>He got up and picked up the big plastic bag by his feet. It took him a moment to find Roger in the crowd: He finally found the detective standing in the parking lot, standing over a dead body lying on the concrete with its head at an oddly skewed angle. \"What the fuck happened here?\" Jeff asked.</p>\n<p>\"Not sure. Looks like one of the perps ran for it and fell down the stairs, broke his neck. What's up?\"</p>\n<p>Jeff handed the big white plastic bag to Rog, who looked inside and nodded. \"I'll find someone to take care of it,\" Rog said. \"Go home. Get some rest.\"</p>\n<p>Jeff nodded back and wearily walked to his car. He got behind the front seat and took a moment to close his eyes and rub his forehead. Then he took out his phone and held down the \"1\" key for a few seconds.</p>\n<p>The phone picked up before it rang twice. \"Jeff?\" a warm, female voice said.</p>\n<p>\"Hi, Tanya,\" Jeff replied. \"How are you?\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm fine\u2026 are you okay, Jeff?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, I'm fine. Are you watching the news?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, I heard\u2026 oh my god, Jeff, was that you?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah,\" Jeff admitted. \"That was me. I'm fine, but McCoy needs me to stay in town for a few days, in case the cops or press want to talk to me. So\u2026 I'm sorry, but I won't be able to make it out tomorrow for little Jeff's birthday. I'll have someone deliver his present, though.\"</p>\n<p>\"I understand. Do you want to talk to him right now?\"</p>\n<p>\"Sure, Tanya. I'd appreciate that. Hi, kiddo, how's it going? You saw me on the news? Yeah, that's your dad, all right. No, I'm fine, son. It'll take more than a couple of bad guys to get me, you know that. Look, something's come up, and I won't be able to come to your party tomorrow: your dad's captain needs him to stay in town and help him to figure out who these bad guys were, but I'll make sure you get your present. So be good to your Mom, okay, son? I'll try to see you next weekend. And don't worry. Everything's gonna work out in the end.\"</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">+\u00a0A\u00a0Wider\u00a0Perspective</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">-\u00a0The\u00a0Original\u00a0View</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<h1 id=\"toc2\"><span>A Wider Perspective</span></h1>\n<p>I don't see why you need me to do this. You can just read the damn transcripts or look at the video records. Oh yeah? Well, fuck yer \"subjective point of view.\" Fine, fine, whatever, don't get yer panties in a bunch. I'm just saying there ain't much I can tell you that you don't already know.</p>\n<p>Where do I start\u2026 well, Tempest Night happened, and suddenly we've got a lot of agents being redirected to deal with the consequences. MC&amp;D pokin' around our territory, tons of escaped skips all over the place, buncha MTFs being reassigned to handle that clusterfuck, which means a lot of missions are running short-handed, which means they had to reassign some of us to deal with, you know, actually finding and capturing skips.</p>\n<p>So they put me and the kid into an investigative cell trying to find some guy who can bend bricks with his bare hands. Yeah, I said <em>bend</em> bricks. No, don't ask me how that shit works. Mine is not to reason why. That's your fucking job.</p>\n<p>So as I was saying, this cell was short-handed because their former mission controller was reassigned to look for Vector: he was on the team that originally brought her in, so they decided they needed his \"unique expertise.\" They didn't need the rest of the team, so they could keep on the mission. But the team needed a new mission controller\u2026 so, of course, they decide to tap good ol' Max and his newbie friend to watch the camera feeds.</p>\n<p>So anyway, we track this guy to a shopping mall, and we're doing a shadow and investigate: two teams of two walking around the mall keeping an eye on this guy to make sure he's not trying anything too hinky. What? Of course they were armed, are you stupid? Don't give me that shit: you know what can happen on this job, and it's a damn good thing they <em>were</em> armed, or shit might have gone down different. Way different. Don't give me that bullshit, these guys were pros, not trigger-happy goons. No, I hadn't worked with them that long, but after enough years on this job you get a feel for this sorta thing. You can tell a pro from an goon easy, and these guys were pros. Yes, that IS my subjective opinion, but that's exactly what you wanted me to give, right? Shut the fuck up and let me talk.</p>\n<p>Anyway, the guy's sitting in the food court eating a hot dog on a stick when shit starts to go down. Tsai saw it first: four guys coming in through the food court glass doors: could be four friends on a shopping trip, but they weren't looking at each other or talking, or even looking at the stores. They were looking at the people. Tsai and Ming decide to fall back to across the bridge to get a better view, and Carter and Wyatt move up to rendezvous with them. It's about when all four of them finally meet up that one of the four motherfuckers in the foodcourt pulls his .45 and starts shooting.</p>\n<p>Shit starts to happen real fast after that. Our guys grab some cover behind some planters. The skip rabbits and starts running for it: so does everyone else, but our guys are pinned down by enemy fire and can't get out. They start returning fire, and Tsai manages to down one of them, which I guess pisses one of them off, because he pulls a motherfucking M203 from his backpack and blows the team to shit. Four flatlines: they're all dead.</p>\n<p>And that's when I told the kid to get us the fuck out of there, because the op was blown. Ever fled the scene of a crime at 35 mph? Fucking nerve wracking. We got out of the parking lot about two minutes before the cops locked the place down. The rest you know.</p>\n<p>What do I think happened? Ain't it fucking obvious? We were set up. You've seen the tapes: those guys were packing heavy heat and wearing heavy armor. Sounds like a gock strike team to me. Is it any coincidence that they found the skip dead of a broken neck shortly after? This was a message: stop fucking around in their territory, or face the consequences. Fucking gock assholes.</p>\n<p>What? Fine, I'll answer one last fucking question, just for you. PDW? No, it was all pistols up until that M203 came out. What? Of course I'm sure. None of us had any, and the gocks were all using .45s. That GOC Personal Defense Weapon fires .223, which sounds completely different.</p>\n<p>\u2026 well, I don't know what to tell you, then.

You're on your own, dear.\"\n\n\n\n\"What's the matter, hun? Scared of a little women's underwear?\"\n\n\n\n\"Not scared, just uncomfortable. It's the way those clerks look at you, like I'm crashing some stranger's party.\"\n\n\n\n\"You could help me pick something out for. . . later,\" Deb smirked.\n\n\n\nTom smiled and kissed her forehead. \"As it turns out, I love surprises.\"\n\n\n\n\"Fine,\" Deb huffed in mock anger. \"I'll just go alone, then. See you in a bit?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, sure, I'll be around. Call my cell when you're done.\"\n\n\n\n\"Sure thing. See ya, hun.\"\n\n\n\nTom headed into the bookstore first and flipped through the best sellers on the front rack. When that grew dull, he headed over to the Brookstone to take a look at some needlessly complicated grilling tools and lay down on the Tempur-Pedic mattress. Around the time he was picking up a pretzel with nacho cheese sauce, he started to wonder how long Deb was going to be looking at bras, anyway. \n\n\n\nHe was in the process of tucking the little white paper bag into his teeth to pull out his cell phone and call when the first shot was fired. At first, it sounded like firecrackers, but then he heard the shouting and saw the men and the guns. There were two groups of them, shouting and running around, hiding behind the white ceramic planters and tipped-over tables in the food court. One of them tried to move from behind a table to behind the counter of the Orange Julius: he fell down about halfway there, clutching his leg, then his head exploded in a spray of red and grey that splattered across the white tile floor.\n\n\n\nTom realized then that he was huddled behind one of the big white planters, his cell phone clutched in his hand in a white-knuckle grip. He'd lost his pretzel at some point: he could see the little brown twist of bread smeared across the tiled floor, little yellow footprints leading away where someone had stomped on his small plastic cup of cheese sauce while running away from the gunfight. \n\n\n\nIt was surreal. Things like this were supposed to happen in downtown Detroit or South Central Los Angeles, not in a Westfield Shopping Center in the Midwestern suburbs. There was a lot of shouting (mostly involving the word \"motherfucker,\") then there was a big boom, and a lot of smoke, and the shooting stopped.\n\n\n\nTom saw a big black man in a brown leather jacket, holding a small gun: it looked like a toy in his big meaty fist. Some men in grey uniforms ran up, then, and the man in the brown leather jacket slowly put down his gun and lay down on the ground with his hands on his head. Tom didn't wait to see what happened next: the moment the cops got the guy, he ran down the escalator and started running towards the Victoria's Secret, shouting Debra's name. \n\n\n\nShe met him outside, and they fell into each other's arms, holding each other tight, as if they would never let go.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\"I felt so useless,\" Tom confessed that night, after the cops and the reporters and the much-needed shower. \"All that was going on. . . and all I could think of was to hide.\"\n\n\n\n\"What could you do?\" Deb asked. She was curled up in his arms and was resting her head on his chest.\n\n\n\n\"I don't know,\" Tom admitted. \"But I felt like I should have done something.\"\n\n\n\nDeb kissed him, and he kissed her back, and then they took each others' clothes off and let things go from there.\n\n\n\nTwo weeks later, Deb announced she'd missed her period. \n\n\n\nSixteen years later, they told their horribly embarassed daughter why her full name was Jennifer Victoria Firefight Nathan.\n\n\n\nSeeing his daughter groan in horror as her younger brother made snarky comments and her boyfriend look on in jaw-dropped awe, Tom thought back to that afternoon in the shopping mall, and laughed. It was funny, he thought, how things tend to work out in the end.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ A Closer Look\" hide=\"- Stepping Back\"]]\n\n\n\n+ A Closer look\n\n\n\n//Gunshot, 9mm, double-tap,// Jeff thought, as the first couple of cracks rang out. It was a sound that didn't belong in a shopping mall at 2 in the afternoon. \n\n\n\nHe dropped the big plastic bag and reached under his leather jacket for his concealed carry weapon. He checked the slide and the ejection port: both looked clear, and took off the safety. \"Lie down on the ground and cover your heads!\" he shouted to the other shoppers. \"Wait here!\"\n\n\n\nHe headed towards the sound of the gunfire, keeping his head low and the muzzle of his gun pointed at the ground. He glanced around the corner leading to the food court, and saw a bunch of knocked-over tables and some guys shooting at each other.\n\n\n\nJeff blinked in surprise: these weren't gangers. Gangers tended to stand up and run around holding their guns out in front of them: they usually relied on mass volume of fire, and they usually took a few shots then ran for it before the cops showed up. What they didn't do was set up lanes of fire, use cover, and coordinate their attacks. Especially coordinate their attacks.\n\n\n\n\"Center Peel, fall back to the counters, go!\" someone shouted. \"Peel one!\" A rapid fusillade of pistol fire rang out, followed by two guys trying to fall back to the food counters. One of them made it, the second took a round in the knee and fell. Jeff saw one of the guys crouched behind the planters take a deliberate double tap and shoot the wounded enemy in the head, killing him.\n\n\n\nJeff's blood ran cold. He'd been a Marine in two tours overseas before retiring: that and six years in the force meant he'd spent just about half his life around guns and gunfighters in some fashion or another, and those fourteen years of experience were telling him that these guys were trained professionals: possibly Special Forces of some sort. Now that he knew what to look for, the lines of their clothing seemed strangely bulky in places: did they have body armor under their jackets and jeans? The small-caliber pistol in his hands suddenly felt very inadequate. \n\n\n\nThen one of the motherfuckers in the food court jumped up holding a small, stubby black tube, and suddenly things went all the way bad. \n\n\n\nJeff didn't wait to see what happened next. \"GRENADE!\" he screamed. He ducked back around the corner, dropped to the ground, put his hands over his ears, closed his eyes, opened his mouth. The explosion felt like a full body punch to the gut. There were a few more shots, and then a lot of shouting. Jeff shook his head to clear his fuzzy vision and got back to his feet.\n\n\n\nThe carnage was incredible. Everyone on the planters side of the firefight was dead or dying. In the food court, he saw the guy with the grenade launcher lying dead on the ground with a bullet in his head. There was another guy standing over him, holding a submachinegun of some sort. \"GET ON THE GROUND, MOTHERFUCKER!\" Jeff shouted. The word \"motherfucker\" was very important in these cases: it let the guy know who was in fucking charge here. \n\n\n\nHe swept his eyes over the perp's body: eyes, face, hands. . . \n\n\n\nHands.\n\n\n\nWhen the perp turned to face him, he saw the guy's hands start to come up, holding his little submachinegun, so Jeff put two in his chest and one in his head. It was done before his heart beat once.\n\n\n\nThe guy fell down and sprawled on the bloody and broken mall floor like a discarded doll. Jeff swallowed hard. It wasn't the first time he'd fired his gun at another human being, but all his fighting in the sandbox had been at long range, shooting his .50 cal at houses from the next sand dune over. He was sure he'd killed some people in his time in the Marines, but this was the first time he'd been close enough to touch the guy as he died. Seeing the light leave the guy's eyes from this close-up. . . \n\n\n\n\"GET DOWN ON THE FUCKING GROUND RIGHT THE FUCK NOW!\" someone screamed, and Jeff winced inwardly. He was suddenly very aware that he was a big black man with a gun standing in the middle of a bunch of dead guys. He very carefully put his pistol down on the ground and slid it into the corner, then lay down in a puddle of sticky wet nastiness and put his hands on his head.\n\n\n\nSomeone ran up to him and put a knee in the small of his back. \"Check my inside left coat pocket,\" Jeff said, slowly and calmly. \n\n\n\n\"SHUT THE FUCK UP, ASSHOLE! DON'T SAY A FUCKING WORD!\" the guy screamed.\n\n\n\n\"Brad?\" an older, wiser voice said. \"Check his fucking coat pocket already before you say something really dumb.\"\n\n\n\nTrembling hands reached into his leather jacket pocket and fumbled out the wallet from his jacket. A few moments later, the pressure on his back let up, and someone reached a hand down to help him to his feet. Jeff looked up into the face of a big, balding white guy with an impressive red beard, wearing a light grey rent-a-cop outfit.\n\n\n\n\"Officer,\" the guard said.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\"Holy crap, Jeff, you look like hell,\" Captain McCoy sighed. \"I thought this was supposed to be your day off.\"\n\n\n\n\"You know me, sir,\" Jeff said, smiling weakly. \"I like to take my work home with me.\"\n\n\n\n\"Nobody likes a workaholic, Jeff. Did you give your statement yet?\"\n\n\n\n\"Rog took it down a few minutes ago,\" Jeff admitted. \"I'm just waiting for someone to tell me I can leave.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, then, consider this an order: go home. Get some rest. Don't bother coming in tomorrow, you can have the day off. But don't leave town either, just in case someone needs to talk to you. Kay?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Jeff sighed.\n\n\n\nHe got up and picked up the big plastic bag by his feet. It took him a moment to find Roger in the crowd: He finally found the detective standing in the parking lot, standing over a dead body lying on the concrete with its head at an oddly skewed angle. \"What the fuck happened here?\" Jeff asked.\n\n\n\n\"Not sure. Looks like one of the perps ran for it and fell down the stairs, broke his neck. What's up?\"\n\n\n\nJeff handed the big white plastic bag to Rog, who looked inside and nodded. \"I'll find someone to take care of it,\" Rog said. \"Go home. Get some rest.\"\n\n\n\nJeff nodded back and wearily walked to his car. He got behind the front seat and took a moment to close his eyes and rub his forehead. Then he took out his phone and held down the \"1\" key for a few seconds. \n\n\n\nThe phone picked up before it rang twice. \"Jeff?\" a warm, female voice said.\n\n\n\n\"Hi, Tanya,\" Jeff replied. \"How are you?\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm fine. . . are you okay, Jeff?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, I'm fine. Are you watching the news?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes, I heard. . . oh my god, Jeff, was that you?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah,\" Jeff admitted. \"That was me. I'm fine, but McCoy needs me to stay in town for a few days, in case the cops or press want to talk to me. So. . . I'm sorry, but I won't be able to make it out tomorrow for little Jeff's birthday. I'll have someone deliver his present, though.\"\n\n\n\n\"I understand. Do you want to talk to him right now?\"\n\n\n\n\"Sure, Tanya. I'd appreciate that. Hi, kiddo, how's it going? You saw me on the news? Yeah, that's your dad, all right. No, I'm fine, son. It'll take more than a couple of bad guys to get me, you know that. Look, something's come up, and I won't be able to come to your party tomorrow: your dad's captain needs him to stay in town and help him to figure out who these bad guys were, but I'll make sure you get your present. So be good to your Mom, okay, son? I'll try to see you next weekend. And don't worry. Everything's gonna work out in the end.\"\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n-----\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ A Wider Perspective\" hide=\"- The Original View\"]]\n\n\n\n+ A Wider Perspective\n\n\n\nI don't see why you need me to do this. You can just read the damn transcripts or look at the video records. Oh yeah? Well, fuck yer \"subjective point of view.\" Fine, fine, whatever, don't get yer panties in a bunch. I'm just saying there ain't much I can tell you that you don't already know. \n\n\n\nWhere do I start. . . well, Tempest Night happened, and suddenly we've got a lot of agents being redirected to deal with the consequences. MC&D pokin' around our territory, tons of escaped skips all over the place, buncha MTFs being reassigned to handle that clusterfuck, which means a lot of missions are running short-handed, which means they had to reassign some of us to deal with, you know, actually finding and capturing skips. \n\n\n\nSo they put me and the kid into an investigative cell trying to find some guy who can bend bricks with his bare hands. Yeah, I said //bend// bricks. No, don't ask me how that shit works. Mine is not to reason why. That's your fucking job.\n\n\n\nSo as I was saying, this cell was short-handed because their former mission controller was reassigned to look for Vector: he was on the team that originally brought her in, so they decided they needed his \"unique expertise.\" They didn't need the rest of the team, so they could keep on the mission. But the team needed a new mission controller. . . so, of course, they decide to tap good ol' Max and his newbie friend to watch the camera feeds.\n\n\n\nSo anyway, we track this guy to a shopping mall, and we're doing a shadow and investigate: two teams of two walking around the mall keeping an eye on this guy to make sure he's not trying anything too hinky. What? Of course they were armed, are you stupid? Don't give me that shit: you know what can happen on this job, and it's a damn good thing they //were// armed, or shit might have gone down different. Way different. Don't give me that bullshit, these guys were pros, not trigger-happy goons. No, I hadn't worked with them that long, but after enough years on this job you get a feel for this sorta thing. You can tell a pro from an goon easy, and these guys were pros. Yes, that IS my subjective opinion, but that's exactly what you wanted me to give, right? Shut the fuck up and let me talk.\n\n\n\nAnyway, the guy's sitting in the food court eating a hot dog on a stick when shit starts to go down. Tsai saw it first: four guys coming in through the food court glass doors: could be four friends on a shopping trip, but they weren't looking at each other or talking, or even looking at the stores. They were looking at the people. Tsai and Ming decide to fall back to across the bridge to get a better view, and Carter and Wyatt move up to rendezvous with them. It's about when all four of them finally meet up that one of the four motherfuckers in the foodcourt pulls his .45 and starts shooting. \n\n\n\nShit starts to happen real fast after that. Our guys grab some cover behind some planters. The skip rabbits and starts running for it: so does everyone else, but our guys are pinned down by enemy fire and can't get out. They start returning fire, and Tsai manages to down one of them, which I guess pisses one of them off, because he pulls a motherfucking M203 from his backpack and blows the team to shit. Four flatlines: they're all dead. \n\n\n\nAnd that's when I told the kid to get us the fuck out of there, because the op was blown. Ever fled the scene of a crime at 35 mph? Fucking nerve wracking. We got out of the parking lot about two minutes before the cops locked the place down. The rest you know.\n\n\n\nWhat do I think happened? Ain't it fucking obvious? We were set up. You've seen the tapes: those guys were packing heavy heat and wearing heavy armor. Sounds like a gock strike team to me. Is it any coincidence that they found the skip dead of a broken neck shortly after? This was a message: stop fucking around in their territory, or face the consequences. Fucking gock assholes.\n\n\n\nWhat? Fine, I'll answer one last fucking question, just for you. PDW? No, it was all pistols up until that M203 came out. What? Of course I'm sure. None of us had any, and the gocks were all using .45s. That GOC Personal Defense Weapon fires .223, which sounds completely different.\n\n\n\n. . . well, I don't know what to tell you, then. Like you said, this was my subjective point of view. All I know is what I saw. I can't tell you exactly how everything worked out.\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n-----\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ From the Other Side\" hide=\"- The Story We Know\"]]\n\n\n\n> **Transcript of Communications Logs: GOC Strike Team 'Marduk,' \u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:\u2588\u2588.**\n\n> \n\n> **Marduk Six (Team Leader and Overwatch):** Comms check.

Everywhere else was deeply dark, the humps and points of old factory equipment looming in the old auto plant. Several large machines had been cleared away, and heavy, steel tables set up, along with huge shelves, all of it covered with junk. At least, it looked like junk to the untrained eye. A bomb technician would have taken one look at that tangle, and run screaming for the hills.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Chicka boom chicka boom, don't you just love it\u2026</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Boomer always worked with his shirt off. He'd been teased mercilessly for the huge sweat stains he'd always made on his shirts in grade school, and the pain had stayed with him his entire life, making partial, hideous nudity preferable to a damp shirt. (Never mind that he'd beaten the child who had started the teasing to death in the woods years and years ago. Some things just stuck.)</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Boom chicka boom, don't you just love it\u2026</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>He was just starting to fit a shock plate to the main detonation assembly when a chiming started. He grunted, freezing and trying to isolate the sound with no small amount of concern, before finally slumping and fishing his phone from his greasy pants pocket.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi, Mom. No, I'm fine, Mom, I was just working.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 No, Mom, I like talking to you. It's fine, really\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 Yes, I'm taking them, Mom\u2026 I just don't like how they make me feel, Mom, it's not\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, Mom, I'm not dis-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 Mom\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026s-stop\u2026 M-m-m-mom, I-I hate i-it whe-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I c-c-can't h-h-h-h-help it!\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a sudden, audible squawking from the phone, the massive man wincing down and away, as if from a blow imagined or remembered,</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 I-I'm sorry, Mom\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI'm sorry\u2026 I won't ever speak that way again\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you too, Mom\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Boomer hung up the phone, then sat for a bit, trembling. He sniffed thickly, glaring down at the phone. He put it on the table, eyes welling with tears. He smashed his fist against it with the force of a good sized car. He smashed it again and again, a thin, ragged squealing leaking from his thick lips as he pounded the phone to bits, blood and scraps of skin smearing over the bench and the ragged wreck of the phone. He stared down at the bloody, shattered mess, heedless of his dripping hand, thick chest rising and falling in great heaves.</p>\n<p>The fat man then pushed the whole mess to the floor, sucking on his ripped and bloody fist like a baby, starting to hum around it again as he started fittings wires back into his current project.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u201cJesus, I almost feel sorry for the bastard. Then I feel that spot where I'm supposed to have a molar.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harken winced, looking away from the small screen, his face a ragged patchwork of tape and a few stitches. The rest of him was encased in enough plaster to count as armor, his right hand little more then a heavily braced claw. Kramer had been playing nursemaid: that is to say, she was checking to see what still hurt. Often. With her finger.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo does that spot on your neck still hurt wh-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFUCK!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, so yes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harken shifted away from his poker-faced tormentor, trying to focus on the small LCD screen. They'd managed to track down Boomer's lair without a massive amount of issue. That being said, they'd kept well away, just getting a robot close enough to attach a tiny camera to the roof. Boomer was the type to leave loads of bombs, traps and other assorted goodies laying around in a nightmare combination of cunning and blind, absentminded stupidity. You could plan around a smart enemy, a dumb one was prone to blowing your intelligent, well-planned ass off at random.</p>\n<p>They'd been watching Boomer for a couple days now, and every hour was more pathetic then the last. Yes, Boomer was a brutal, sadistic psychopath, but he was also apparently a pathetic, broken man with no real life, friends, or interests. No wonder he was so loyal to Dark: he'd probably never had a purpose or praise before Mr. Dark had stepped in.</p>\n<p>Harken set the portable viewscreen down, gingerly rubbing his eyes. \u201cOkay, so, we know where the fat boy is going to be, but I'm not really overeager to get blown up trying to get to him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI could always drop in, or slide a shot through one of those upper windows.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no, that's a bitch of a shot, and one miss could blow the whole place. Plus, who knows how he has the place rigged? I reviewed some files Central Records had on him: apparently a GOC strike team tried sneaking into a house he was using. They managed to blow up nearly a city block, and lost the whole team. Boomer wasn't even home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what's your big plan?\" Kramer asked. \"I'm not overeager to wonder on every mission whether or not there's a random explosive or fat sociopath waiting in the wings. Plus, the only one who gets to slap you around is me. See, like thi-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFUCK!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow, that cast doesn't act as a buffer at all, does it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cANYWAY. I think I have a idea\u2026isn't there a GOC squad in the area, hunting for\u2026 uhh\u2026 oh dammit, that one germ bitch, whatshername\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSCP-353, Vector.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat's the one. Maybe they need to accidentally intercept a secured Foundation transmission discussing the difficulty of extracting the poor girl from the warehouse she's holed up in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut she's not \u2014 oh. Clever. Meanwhile, what do we do about her? Someone needs to get her back to site.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh to hell with that, some MTF can go after that bitch. The last thing I need is an infection right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I know. This looks like it's kinda red and-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFUCK!!\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u201cBobby, Bobby, my love, get in here, it's great to see you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan't say the same.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh Bobby, that's why I love you. While all the world cries for my amusement, I can always count on you to be the same hard-nosed prick as always.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bobby was standing at parade rest just inside the doorway to the terrible man's office. It looked more like a overstuffed museum, with layers of carpets, relics, and assorted treasure covering every available surface in a haphazard fashion. There was probably more money in this room then some third world nation's gross national product, but it just looked like a old antique shop. Mr. Marshall sat in a wine-dark upholstered chair to one side, the fabric probably worth more then his life right now. Mr. Dark reclined behind a small, chipped desk. If Bobby recalled correctly, it was the same one the \u201cFrom Hell\u201d Jack The Ripper letter had been penned on.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou seem in tolerable shape, lad. None the worse for wear after your little stint in the nuthatch?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026I'm fine, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bobby looked sidelong at Marshall, who was pointedly observing his fingernails. Bobby's hard mouth twitched, washed-out brown eyes narrowing in all that he would allow to show of his anger. For now. He'd been forced to mop up one of Marshall's little\u2026 accidents\u2026 but the cleanup had gotten out of hand. People had died. The police had caught him. Thankfully, Carter had been able to pull some strings and get him off death row and into an asylum - one, coincidentally, owned by a member of the Club.</p>\n<p>The rest had been nice: the days slow and easy, with nothing to do but watch the actual crazies and attend \"therapy\" sessions that mostly consisted of shooting the shit with other MC&amp;D employees. He'd even gotten laid a few times: there was no shortage of attractive and heavily medicated female \"patients\" who, if not exactly willing, were not prone to believable protest. Still, he'd known better than to relax. Service to Marshall, Carter, and Dark ended with death alone. He hoped.</p>\n<p>\u201cBobby, you're a busy boy, so I'll not shilly-shally any more,\" Dark said. \"Persons who shall remain nameless have bobbled the ball both on our patch and others. You feel up to hitting the pavement and shoring up our collection?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you asking me? I don't have a choice, do I?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dark laughed, rising from his chair, waving a hand to Marshall as he crossed to stand in front of Bobby.</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you look at this glorious boy?\u201d he chortled, turning and winking at Marshall. \u201cYou'd think he was still a cop out in Whitechapel, and me some smuggler who's making him go crooked. No, Bobby, you don't have a choice. Few do, really. You should feel privileged not to have to bear up the weight of those illusions.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yes,\" Bobby said, flatly. \"Deeply honored.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dark smiled coldly, tilting his head a bit and locking eyes with Bobby. \u201cDo this, and do it well Bobby. You know the stakes, and I always pay well. I'm a man of my word. It's up to you to choose what word it is I keep.\u201d</p>\n<p>They stared for a few heartbeats, one dark, one gray, an almost audible tension crackling in the air. Bobby finally straightened, snapping off a salute that might as well have been a middle finger, and turned on his heels, marching out. Dark chuckled coldly, watching the door for several seconds before turning back to his desk.</p>\n<p>Marshall spoke up from the depths of the chair, rubbing his eye absently. \u201cHe's going to turn on you, you know that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course he's going to turn on me. Why the hell else would I keep that grating son of a bitch around?\u201d</p>\n<p>Marshall stared at Dark, shaking his head in confusion. Dark lit a black cigar, blowing a thick cloud across the small office. \u201cYou know the difference between you, Carter, and me?\u201d Dark asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat's that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAmbition. See, you two lunatics would be more than happy to gut me, kill off your rival, and set yourself as Emperor Of All That Is. Then again, you're both bloody hedonistic bastards. It's in your nature to take all you can get your hands on, and that's both useful and amusing. However, if you rule all that is\u2026 what then? How many families can you burn and force into auto-cannibalism before the blush wears off? How long can you bask in the admiration and fear of a planet before it just wafts into the background?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026 what\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up when the adults are talking, Marshall. I want to enjoy myself, to have some bloody fun, eh? Sometimes that's sitting out in a spring breeze, being served tea warmed on a pretty girl's lap. Sometimes it's watching a child try and scramble around the rabid animals eating their parents. Sometimes it's just eating a really good steak. It's all relative, really. I don't want to crush all reality below my heel\u2026 just small, easily observable and touchable parts of it, now and then. I don't have ambition, Marshall, which means my ego will tolerate a threat. I welcome it, really.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo\u2026 you're just letting him plot against you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I am, you bloody twit! I bloody well helped him along! I was the biggest bastard I could be to him, hurt his loved ones, corrupted his oh-so-sacred morals\u2026 It was damned exhausting. Still, it's paying off\u2026 I think this is the time, this is it. Can you imagine the thrill of excitement and fear, knowing that someone could lash out, rise up, and generally throw the standard state of things in the fire, at any moment? Makes everything seem\u2026 fresher, more clear. Why do you think I insisted the team have those little cameras? When Bobby does finally go, I want to be able to relive it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou're a sick man, Dark.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you're a unimaginative twat, but I don't throw it in your face, now do I? Who do we bloody have on that fox girl? I want a status report within the hour, and I want to know where the hell she's gotten off to even sooner. Now get the hell out of my office.\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"<em>I've got somethin' to say\u2026\"</em> the girl hummed, as she picked through the racks of vials on the refrigerator shelf. \"<em>I killed your baby today. It doesn't matter much to me as long as it's dead\u2026</em>\"</p>\n<p>She read the label on one particular vial and smiled. Popping the top off the small glass tube, she threw her head back and drank it down in one gulp, savoring the taste as it went down. She felt the lovely little microbes begin to attack her body, but it was a simple enough matter to calm them down, to get them dancing in harmony with the rest of her little darlings.</p>\n<p>\"<em>I've got something to say\u2026</em>\" she continued, pouring the can of gasoline all over the refrigerator room. \"<em>I raped your momma today. It doesn't matter much as long as she spread\u2026</em>\"</p>\n<p>The body of a white-coated researcher was slumped in his chair bleeding from every orifice: Ebola was not a good way to go. \"<em>Sweet lovely death, I'm waiting for your breath,</em>\" she sang, as she lit a match. \"<em>Sweet lovely death one last car-hnnnnngh!</em>\"</p>\n<p>The last note of her song dissolved into a grunt of pain as ten thousand volts of electricity coursed through her body. She collapsed in a heap, dropping the box of matches and scattering them all over the clean room. She tried to get back to her feet, but a second jolt of lightning sent her crashing back down to the ground.</p>\n<p>She tried to reach out with her viruses, to lash out with everything she had, but yet another jolt from the taser broke her concentration. \"None of that, my dear,\" a sonorous voice commanded. Vector was turned roughly onto her back, and looked up into the faces of three people wearing full biocontainment gear. \"Sandra, the syringe,\" the voice continued.</p>\n<p>One of the three - a woman - walked forward carrying a small black leather pouch. Vector kicked out at her. The three figures just stepped back, and the one with the taser pressed a button. Another shock of lightning arced through her, and she let out a scream. The man with the taser moved the weapon to his other hand and drew a pistol from a hip holster. \"That was one and two,\" he said, gesturing with the taser. \"This is three.\" He kneeled next to her and placed the muzzle of the gun to her forehead.</p>\n<p>Vector lay still, trembling, as the woman pinned her arm under one knee and cut the sleeve of her jacket away with a knife. She tied a rubber hose around her upper arm then expertly drew two large vials of blood. Finally, she inserted a large syringe of\u2026 something\u2026 into the girl's neck and waited, thumb resting on the plunger.</p>\n<p>The third man, who had been watching the operation from the doorway, finally walked forward. He leaned in very close to Vector, and through his hood, she could see that he was an older man, his hair shot with grey, and his face lined with age. \"Kevin Spencer,\" the old man said. \"His name was Kevin Spencer.\"</p>\n<p>\"W-w-w-who?\"</p>\n<p>\"The man you killed. He risked his life to set you free, and you murdered him. He had a wife and a child. He was a firm believer in the cause. He made the best barbecue ribs I have ever tasted, and you took all of that away from us. And why? To intimidate the others into following you? They would have done so if you had asked. Such a waste.\"</p>\n<p>\"F-f-f-fuck you\u2026 I d-d-d-d-don't work for y-y-y-y\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"I know you don't. And I wouldn't dream of forcing you to do so. You are free to do as you wish. But freedom means living with the consequences of your actions. Sandra?\"</p>\n<p>The old man stepped back. The woman with the syringe leaned forward and showed Vector the two vials of blood. \"This one we keep,\" the woman said, holding up one of the vials. \"And this one you'll get back.\" She tucked the two vials into her suit pocket, then held up an empty glass bottle with a double-circle and arrows logo on it. \"We took this from the Foundation when we raided them. Do you know what it is?\"</p>\n<p>Vector read the label through pain-blurred eyes. \"No!\" she screamed. \"You can't!\"</p>\n<p>\"Easy! Easy!\" Sandra said. \"Don't do something stupid! Listen\u2026 LISTEN TO ME!\" she shouted, as Vector began to struggle. \"I don't want to kill you, so shut up and LISTEN!\"</p>\n<p>Vector lay still, trembling. \"Listen,\" Sandra repeated. \"You took Kevin from us, so we're taking what you love away too. This is going to flush your body of all those viruses and germs you've been collecting\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"Please, don't\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"\u2026 but you're going to get back whatever is in that blood. But you only get that back if we feel you've learned your lesson. So if you were thinking about trying to screw us over? You're going to lose everything. Do you understand?\"</p>\n<p>Vector closed her eyes and nodded, tears streaming down her cheeks. Sandra grimly pressed down on the plunger of the syringe.</p>\n<p>Fire ripped through the girl's body, and billions of lives were snuffed out in a cascade of chemical death.</p>\n<p>She didn't know when it stopped, or when the dying ended. She was only even vaguely aware when the three monsters in their plastic suits left the room, or when someone lit a fire and burned down the laboratory. She did remember being carried out. She remembered curling up in his arms and weeping into his shoulder, feeling the distant, comforting sensation of the microorganisms in his body, wanting to pull them into her, but knowing that if she did, the flames rippling through her would simply kill them off.</p>\n<p>It was just as she was being placed into the back seat of a car that her mind decided it had had enough and decided to cut out. Oblivion overcame her and she embraced it gladly.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"Pull over,\" Michel ordered.</p>\n<p>James pulled the van over to the side of the road, and Michel got out and walked over to a tree. He leaned against it, then vomited noisily into the grass.</p>\n<p>\"Fuck,\" Sandra grimaced. She reached for a box with a biohazard label on it taped to the side of the plastic-lined compartment, but was interrupted by the Professor putting a hand over hers.</p>\n<p>\"Wait here,\" the old man said. \"I'll let you know if you need to worry.\"</p>\n<p>He exited the makeshift quarantine compartment in the back of the van and walked to the side of the road, where Michel was now sitting with his knees pulled to his chest and tears streaming down his face. The Professor sat down next to the big Frenchman and put an arm around his wide shoulders, pulling him close. \"I'm sorry,\" he said, simply. \"It needed to be done.\"</p>\n<p>\"Did we have to do it like THAT!?\" Michel asked. \"That was\u2026 UGLY\u2026 it was\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"I know,\" the Professor said. \"I know. It was an unpleasant, hideous act to do to another human being. But so was what she did to Kevin. Justice needed to be done. A lesson needed to be taught.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm done,\" Michel said. \"I can't do this any more. Not after that.\"</p>\n<p>The Professor nodded, and hugged the big man again. \"You're a good soldier, Michel,\" he said. \"You have fought well for the cause. Go home and be with your loved ones and enjoy the new world you are creating. Thank you for your service.\"</p>\n<p>He helped the big man get to his feet and led him to the van. The rest of the trip passed in silence. Nothing needed to be said. Everyone understood.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>She didn't remember much except that it was incredibly unpleasant and incredibly humiliating. On top of the pain of the serum racing through her body, there was the devastating effect it had on a body that had developed an equilibrium with billions of different kinds of lethal microorganisms, as well as many which were nonlethal. The effect on her digestive system alone didn't even bear thinking about.</p>\n<p>The worst part where the nightmares. Every time she closed her eyes, she saw demons in white coats and surgical masks wielding syringes full of death. White rooms lit with fluorescent tubes that cast no shadows. A man with no head cut her apart with a scalpel, held the pieces up to the light, then dunked them in a greenish liquid and put them back where they had come from. Grinning midgets with wide mouths full of too many sharklike teeth sat in the rafters and cackled. \"You'll never get out. You'll never get out.\"</p>\n<p>The only comfort was when the Angel came. That was how she thought of him, for in her pain-induced delirium, his handsome face seemed suffused in a holy light. The Angel was the one who would wipe away her sweat from her feverish forehead. The Angel was the one who cleaned her up and changed her IVs. He held her hand throughout the worst of the pain, and whispered soft lullabies to her when she whimpered.</p>\n<p>In her hour of loneliness, he was her friend, and she loved him for it.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>When she finally emerged from her drug-induced delirium, she found herself lying on clean sheets in a soft bed. The sun was shining through a window in the attic room, casting a square of light onto the cheerful flower-print wallpaper. There was a framed cross-stitch on the wall across from her depicting two children playing on the front lawn of a red brick house. \"HOME IS WHERE THE HEART IS,\" it read.</p>\n<p>She felt empty\u2026 drained\u2026 alone. For the first time since she could remember, she was a single person, without the familiar warmth of her old friends nestled inside her. She closed her eyes and reached out, calling to her beloved microscopic companions: a virus here, a bacterium there. She called them to her, and they answered, and as they did so, she felt her strength return to her, felt her broken spirit rejuvenating.</p>\n<p>The door opened, and a young man wearing an apron over his jeans and t-shirt walked in, carrying a large hot bowl of chicken soup. \"Feeling better?\" he asked, setting it down by her side. \"It's good to see you awake again.\"</p>\n<p>Vector looked up into his face, and she blushed. It was the Angel.</p>\n<p>\"Don't get up just yet,\" he said. \"Let me check your vital signs first.\" He sat down next to her and checked her pulse and blood pressure, nodded at the numbers. \"Much better,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"How long was I out?\" she asked.</p>\n<p>\"About a week. How are you feeling?\" the young man asked.</p>\n<p>\"Better,\" Vector said. She twisted the sheets under her fingers tightly, nervously.</p>\n<p>\"You look better,\" the young man said kindly. \"Is there something I can do for you?\"</p>\n<p>She felt a familiar taste in the air, and she smiled. \"Yes,\" she whispered. \"You can die.\"</p>\n<p>Staphylococcus aureus is a contradictory bacteria. It is constantly present in the environment: on the skin, in the mucus membranes of the nose and throat, in acne. Approximately one in five humans is a carrier and, for the most part, coexist with it in relative peace. However, that same bacteria, which is harmless enough in most places, turns into one of the most virulent and deadly organisms known to man if allowed to infect the wrong tissues. In the skin, it causes necrotizing fasciitis, which literally eats skin and muscle tissue at an alarming rate. In the blood, it causes toxic shock syndrome, which can kill in hours. In spinal fluid, it causes meningitis, which can lead to brain damage and gangrene. In the lungs, pneumonia.</p>\n<p>Vector hit him with all of them at once, then boosted the virulence as hard as she could. He was dead within seconds.</p>\n<p>She stepped around over his twitching, decaying body and went to the wardrobe in the corner. As expected, all the clothes were some sort of hideous floral print frocks that looked like something a mother from a Norman Rockwell painting would wear. She picked the least disgusting looking one and changed into it, then threw an overcoat on over it. No shoes, but if she could just\u2026</p>\n<p>There was a loud crash, and then shouting. Gunfire cracked in bright, staccato beats: the high, bright crack of an assault rifle, underlaid by the lower booming of a shotgun. Then silence.</p>\n<p>She ran to the window. There were men outside, wearing black tactical gear, and they were dragging two dead bodies into the back of an unmarked white van. Several more were moving towards the house with the smooth, practiced movements of professional soldiers. A couple more were pushing a nondescript white Toyota Camry off the dock and into a nearby lake: it splashed into the water and quickly sank from view.</p>\n<p>The door opened, and a man wearing full hazmat gear, carrying a submachine gun, walked in. He held up a photo and nodded. \"It's her.\"</p>\n<p>Another man slung his rifle and drew a pistol, shooting her twice in the chest. She looked down and saw the yellow tassel of a dart sticking from her body, then the drugs took hold, and she passed out.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"This is Bobby. Tell Dark we have her.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Harken woke up around midnight with the distinct feeling there was someone in the room. Then he saw the silhouette standing at his window: the silhouette of a tall man wearing a fedora and long overcoat.</p>\n<p>\"You must think you're very clever, Mister Harken,\" the stranger said.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026 ahh\u2026 like to think so, yes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"I will admit, your ruse was almost successful.\"</p>\n<p>Harken thought for several seconds about denying it, but didn't see the point. \u201cOnly almost?\u201d</p>\n<p>\"Just so. Let me tell you about the full consequences of your actions, Mister Harken,\" the stranger continued. \"Because of your\u2026 tip\u2026 the GOC pulled elements from their strike team shadowing the girl known as 'Vector' to investigate the warehouse in question. The strike team was seconds away from breach when the overwatch element recognized the person known as \"Boomer.\" They were barely able to abort the mission before what would certainly have been a costly and fatal mistake.\"</p>\n<p>\"Damn. Well, good on them. No harm no foul, I suppose?\"</p>\n<p>\"But there was harm, Mister Harken. Because the GOC diverted elements to the warehouse, they dispatched only two agents to investigate the next likely lead: a farmhouse in Colorado. When they arrived, the agents were ambushed and killed. Shortly afterward, a UAV doing surveillance of the region showed several known employees of Marshall, Carter, and Dark carrying an unconscious female in her mid-twenties to an unmarked vehicle. The female was later confirmed to be the target in question.\"</p>\n<p>Harken felt his mouth go dry. He swallowed hard. \"The richies got the germ girl.\"</p>\n<p>\"All thanks to your little 'tip,' Mister Harken. All thanks to your little tip.\" The stranger walked to the bathroom door and waited with one hand on the handle. \"Mister Harken. This is a war. You and yours need to seriously consider whose side you are on.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah? And whose side are you on?\" Harken growled.</p>\n<p>\"You already know the answer to that, Mister Harken,\" the man said. \"I'm on Nobody's side.\"</p>\n<p>He walked into the bathroom and closed the door behind him. Harken already knew that by the time anyone else opened that door, it would be empty. He still rose and threw the door open on the cool, tile lined darkness. Not surprising, really.</p>\n<p>After all, Nobody could get out of a locked room with only one door.</p>\n<p>He sighed heavily, thinking of the report he'd have to file, leaning on the door frame.</p>\n<p>\u201cKramer's never gonna let me hear the end of this.\u201d</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/gdp2-point-in-line\">Point In Line</a>\" by DrClef and Dr Gears, from the <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Everywhere else was deeply dark, the humps and points of old factory equipment looming in the old auto plant. Several large machines had been cleared away, and heavy, steel tables set up, along with huge shelves, all of it covered with junk. At least, it looked like junk to the untrained eye. A bomb technician would have taken one look at that tangle, and run screaming for the hills.\n\n\n\n\u201c//Chicka boom chicka boom, don't you just love it\u2026//\u201d\n\n\n\nBoomer always worked with his shirt off. He'd been teased mercilessly for the huge sweat stains he'd always made on his shirts in grade school, and the pain had stayed with him his entire life, making partial, hideous nudity preferable to a damp shirt. (Never mind that he'd beaten the child who had started the teasing to death in the woods years and years ago. Some things just stuck.)\n\n\n\n\u201c//Boom chicka boom, don't you just love it\u2026//\u201d\n\n\n\nHe was just starting to fit a shock plate to the main detonation assembly when a chiming started. He grunted, freezing and trying to isolate the sound with no small amount of concern, before finally slumping and fishing his phone from his greasy pants pocket.\n\n\n\n\u201cHi, Mom. No, I'm fine, Mom, I was just working.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026 No, Mom, I like talking to you. It's fine, really\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c. . . Yes, I'm taking them, Mom\u2026 I just don't like how they make me feel, Mom, it's not\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNo, Mom, I'm not dis-\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026 Mom\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026s-stop\u2026 M-m-m-mom, I-I hate i-it whe-\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBut I c-c-can't h-h-h-h-help it!\u201d\n\n\n\nThere was a sudden, audible squawking from the phone, the massive man wincing down and away, as if from a blow imagined or remembered,\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026 I-I'm sorry, Mom\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI'm sorry\u2026 I won't ever speak that way again\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI love you too, Mom\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nBoomer hung up the phone, then sat for a bit, trembling. He sniffed thickly, glaring down at the phone. He put it on the table, eyes welling with tears. He smashed his fist against it with the force of a good sized car. He smashed it again and again, a thin, ragged squealing leaking from his thick lips as he pounded the phone to bits, blood and scraps of skin smearing over the bench and the ragged wreck of the phone. He stared down at the bloody, shattered mess, heedless of his dripping hand, thick chest rising and falling in great heaves. \n\n\n\nThe fat man then pushed the whole mess to the floor, sucking on his ripped and bloody fist like a baby, starting to hum around it again as he started fittings wires back into his current project.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\u201cJesus, I almost feel sorry for the bastard. Then I feel that spot where I'm supposed to have a molar.\u201d\n\n\n\nHarken winced, looking away from the small screen, his face a ragged patchwork of tape and a few stitches. The rest of him was encased in enough plaster to count as armor, his right hand little more then a heavily braced claw. Kramer had been playing nursemaid: that is to say, she was checking to see what still hurt. Often. With her finger.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo does that spot on your neck still hurt wh-\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFUCK!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOkay, so yes.\u201d\n\n\n\nHarken shifted away from his poker-faced tormentor, trying to focus on the small LCD screen. They'd managed to track down Boomer's lair without a massive amount of issue. That being said, they'd kept well away, just getting a robot close enough to attach a tiny camera to the roof. Boomer was the type to leave loads of bombs, traps and other assorted goodies laying around in a nightmare combination of cunning and blind, absentminded stupidity. You could plan around a smart enemy, a dumb one was prone to blowing your intelligent, well-planned ass off at random.\n\n\n\nThey'd been watching Boomer for a couple days now, and every hour was more pathetic then the last. Yes, Boomer was a brutal, sadistic psychopath, but he was also apparently a pathetic, broken man with no real life, friends, or interests. No wonder he was so loyal to Dark: he'd probably never had a purpose or praise before Mr. Dark had stepped in. \n\n\n\nHarken set the portable viewscreen down, gingerly rubbing his eyes. \u201cOkay, so, we know where the fat boy is going to be, but I'm not really overeager to get blown up trying to get to him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI could always drop in, or slide a shot through one of those upper windows.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNo, no, that's a bitch of a shot, and one miss could blow the whole place. Plus, who knows how he has the place rigged? I reviewed some files Central Records had on him: apparently a GOC strike team tried sneaking into a house he was using. They managed to blow up nearly a city block, and lost the whole team. Boomer wasn't even home.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSo what's your big plan?\" Kramer asked. \"I'm not overeager to wonder on every mission whether or not there's a random explosive or fat sociopath waiting in the wings. Plus, the only one who gets to slap you around is me. See, like thi-\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFUCK!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWow, that cast doesn't act as a buffer at all, does it?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cANYWAY. I think I have a idea\u2026isn't there a GOC squad in the area, hunting for\u2026 uhh\u2026 oh dammit, that one germ bitch, whatshername\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSCP-353, Vector.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThat's the one. Maybe they need to accidentally intercept a secured Foundation transmission discussing the difficulty of extracting the poor girl from the warehouse she's holed up in.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBut she's not -- oh. Clever. Meanwhile, what do we do about her? Someone needs to get her back to site.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh to hell with that, some MTF can go after that bitch. The last thing I need is an infection right now.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah, I know. This looks like it's kinda red and-\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFUCK!!\u201d\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\u201cBobby, Bobby, my love, get in here, it's great to see you!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cCan't say the same.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh Bobby, that's why I love you. While all the world cries for my amusement, I can always count on you to be the same hard-nosed prick as always.\u201d\n\n\n\nBobby was standing at parade rest just inside the doorway to the terrible man's office. It looked more like a overstuffed museum, with layers of carpets, relics, and assorted treasure covering every available surface in a haphazard fashion. There was probably more money in this room then some third world nation's gross national product, but it just looked like a old antique shop. Mr. Marshall sat in a wine-dark upholstered chair to one side, the fabric probably worth more then his life right now. Mr. Dark reclined behind a small, chipped desk. If Bobby recalled correctly, it was the same one the \u201cFrom Hell\u201d Jack The Ripper letter had been penned on.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou seem in tolerable shape, lad. None the worse for wear after your little stint in the nuthatch?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026I'm fine, sir.\u201d\n\n\n\nBobby looked sidelong at Marshall, who was pointedly observing his fingernails. Bobby's hard mouth twitched, washed-out brown eyes narrowing in all that he would allow to show of his anger. For now. He'd been forced to mop up one of Marshall's little\u2026 accidents\u2026 but the cleanup had gotten out of hand. People had died. The police had caught him. Thankfully, Carter had been able to pull some strings and get him off death row and into an asylum - one, coincidentally, owned by a member of the Club. \n\n\n\nThe rest had been nice: the days slow and easy, with nothing to do but watch the actual crazies and attend \"therapy\" sessions that mostly consisted of shooting the shit with other MC&D employees. He'd even gotten laid a few times: there was no shortage of attractive and heavily medicated female \"patients\" who, if not exactly willing, were not prone to believable protest. Still, he'd known better than to relax. Service to Marshall, Carter, and Dark ended with death alone. He hoped.\n\n\n\n\u201cBobby, you're a busy boy, so I'll not shilly-shally any more,\" Dark said. \"Persons who shall remain nameless have bobbled the ball both on our patch and others. You feel up to hitting the pavement and shoring up our collection?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy are you asking me? I don't have a choice, do I?\u201d\n\n\n\nDark laughed, rising from his chair, waving a hand to Marshall as he crossed to stand in front of Bobby.\n\n\n\n\u201cWould you look at this glorious boy?\u201d he chortled, turning and winking at Marshall. \u201cYou'd think he was still a cop out in Whitechapel, and me some smuggler who's making him go crooked. No, Bobby, you don't have a choice. Few do, really. You should feel privileged not to have to bear up the weight of those illusions.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh yes,\" Bobby said, flatly. \"Deeply honored.\u201d\n\n\n\nDark smiled coldly, tilting his head a bit and locking eyes with Bobby. \u201cDo this, and do it well Bobby. You know the stakes, and I always pay well. I'm a man of my word. It's up to you to choose what word it is I keep.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey stared for a few heartbeats, one dark, one gray, an almost audible tension crackling in the air. Bobby finally straightened, snapping off a salute that might as well have been a middle finger, and turned on his heels, marching out. Dark chuckled coldly, watching the door for several seconds before turning back to his desk. \n\n\n\nMarshall spoke up from the depths of the chair, rubbing his eye absently. \u201cHe's going to turn on you, you know that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course he's going to turn on me. Why the hell else would I keep that grating son of a bitch around?\u201d\n\n\n\nMarshall stared at Dark, shaking his head in confusion. Dark lit a black cigar, blowing a thick cloud across the small office. \u201cYou know the difference between you, Carter, and me?\u201d Dark asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat's that?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAmbition. See, you two lunatics would be more than happy to gut me, kill off your rival, and set yourself as Emperor Of All That Is. Then again, you're both bloody hedonistic bastards. It's in your nature to take all you can get your hands on, and that's both useful and amusing. However, if you rule all that is\u2026 what then? How many families can you burn and force into auto-cannibalism before the blush wears off? How long can you bask in the admiration and fear of a planet before it just wafts into the background?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2026 what\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cShut up when the adults are talking, Marshall. I want to enjoy myself, to have some bloody fun, eh? Sometimes that's sitting out in a spring breeze, being served tea warmed on a pretty girl's lap. Sometimes it's watching a child try and scramble around the rabid animals eating their parents. Sometimes it's just eating a really good steak. It's all relative, really. I don't want to crush all reality below my heel\u2026 just small, easily observable and touchable parts of it, now and then. I don't have ambition, Marshall, which means my ego will tolerate a threat. I welcome it, really.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSo\u2026 you're just letting him plot against you?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course I am, you bloody twit! I bloody well helped him along! I was the biggest bastard I could be to him, hurt his loved ones, corrupted his oh-so-sacred morals. . . It was damned exhausting. Still, it's paying off\u2026 I think this is the time, this is it. Can you imagine the thrill of excitement and fear, knowing that someone could lash out, rise up, and generally throw the standard state of things in the fire, at any moment? Makes everything seem\u2026 fresher, more clear. Why do you think I insisted the team have those little cameras? When Bobby does finally go, I want to be able to relive it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou're a sick man, Dark.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd you're a unimaginative twat, but I don't throw it in your face, now do I? Who do we bloody have on that fox girl? I want a status report within the hour, and I want to know where the hell she's gotten off to even sooner. Now get the hell out of my office.\u201d\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n\"//I've got somethin' to say\u2026\"// the girl hummed, as she picked through the racks of vials on the refrigerator shelf. \"//I killed your baby today. It doesn't matter much to me as long as it's dead\u2026//\"\n\n\n\nShe read the label on one particular vial and smiled. Popping the top off the small glass tube, she threw her head back and drank it down in one gulp, savoring the taste as it went down. She felt the lovely little microbes begin to attack her body, but it was a simple enough matter to calm them down, to get them dancing in harmony with the rest of her little darlings.\n\n\n\n\"//I've got something to say\u2026//\" she continued, pouring the can of gasoline all over the refrigerator room. \"//I raped your momma today. It doesn't matter much as long as she spread\u2026//\"\n\n\n\nThe body of a white-coated researcher was slumped in his chair bleeding from every orifice: Ebola was not a good way to go. \"//Sweet lovely death, I'm waiting for your breath,//\" she sang, as she lit a match. \"//Sweet lovely death one last car-hnnnnngh!//\"\n\n\n\nThe last note of her song dissolved into a grunt of pain as ten thousand volts of electricity coursed through her body. She collapsed in a heap, dropping the box of matches and scattering them all over the clean room. She tried to get back to her feet, but a second jolt of lightning sent her crashing back down to the ground.\n\n\n\nShe tried to reach out with her viruses, to lash out with everything she had, but yet another jolt from the taser broke her concentration. \"None of that, my dear,\" a sonorous voice commanded. Vector was turned roughly onto her back, and looked up into the faces of three people wearing full biocontainment gear. \"Sandra, the syringe,\" the voice continued.\n\n\n\nOne of the three - a woman - walked forward carrying a small black leather pouch. Vector kicked out at her. The three figures just stepped back, and the one with the taser pressed a button. Another shock of lightning arced through her, and she let out a scream. The man with the taser moved the weapon to his other hand and drew a pistol from a hip holster. \"That was one and two,\" he said, gesturing with the taser. \"This is three.\" He kneeled next to her and placed the muzzle of the gun to her forehead. \n\n\n\nVector lay still, trembling, as the woman pinned her arm under one knee and cut the sleeve of her jacket away with a knife. She tied a rubber hose around her upper arm then expertly drew two large vials of blood. Finally, she inserted a large syringe of. . . something. . . into the girl's neck and waited, thumb resting on the plunger.\n\n\n\nThe third man, who had been watching the operation from the doorway, finally walked forward. He leaned in very close to Vector, and through his hood, she could see that he was an older man, his hair shot with grey, and his face lined with age. \"Kevin Spencer,\" the old man said. \"His name was Kevin Spencer.\"\n\n\n\n\"W-w-w-who?\"\n\n\n\n\"The man you killed. He risked his life to set you free, and you murdered him. He had a wife and a child. He was a firm believer in the cause. He made the best barbecue ribs I have ever tasted, and you took all of that away from us. And why? To intimidate the others into following you? They would have done so if you had asked. Such a waste.\"\n\n\n\n\"F-f-f-fuck you\u2026 I d-d-d-d-don't work for y-y-y-y\u2026\"\n\n\n\n\"I know you don't. And I wouldn't dream of forcing you to do so. You are free to do as you wish. But freedom means living with the consequences of your actions. Sandra?\"\n\n\n\nThe old man stepped back. The woman with the syringe leaned forward and showed Vector the two vials of blood. \"This one we keep,\" the woman said, holding up one of the vials. \"And this one you'll get back.\" She tucked the two vials into her suit pocket, then held up an empty glass bottle with a double-circle and arrows logo on it. \"We took this from the Foundation when we raided them. Do you know what it is?\"\n\n\n\nVector read the label through pain-blurred eyes. \"No!\" she screamed. \"You can't!\"\n\n\n\n\"Easy! Easy!\" Sandra said. \"Don't do something stupid! Listen\u2026 LISTEN TO ME!\" she shouted, as Vector began to struggle. \"I don't want to kill you, so shut up and LISTEN!\"\n\n\n\nVector lay still, trembling. \"Listen,\" Sandra repeated. \"You took Kevin from us, so we're taking what you love away too. This is going to flush your body of all those viruses and germs you've been collecting\u2026\"\n\n\n\n\"Please, don't\u2026\"\n\n\n\n\"\u2026 but you're going to get back whatever is in that blood. But you only get that back if we feel you've learned your lesson. So if you were thinking about trying to screw us over? You're going to lose everything. Do you understand?\"\n\n\n\nVector closed her eyes and nodded, tears streaming down her cheeks. Sandra grimly pressed down on the plunger of the syringe.\n\n\n\nFire ripped through the girl's body, and billions of lives were snuffed out in a cascade of chemical death.\n\n\n\nShe didn't know when it stopped, or when the dying ended. She was only even vaguely aware when the three monsters in their plastic suits left the room, or when someone lit a fire and burned down the laboratory. She did remember being carried out. She remembered curling up in his arms and weeping into his shoulder, feeling the distant, comforting sensation of the microorganisms in his body, wanting to pull them into her, but knowing that if she did, the flames rippling through her would simply kill them off.\n\n\n\nIt was just as she was being placed into the back seat of a car that her mind decided it had had enough and decided to cut out. Oblivion overcame her and she embraced it gladly.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\"Pull over,\" Michel ordered.\n\n\n\nJames pulled the van over to the side of the road, and Michel got out and walked over to a tree. He leaned against it, then vomited noisily into the grass.\n\n\n\n\"Fuck,\" Sandra grimaced. She reached for a box with a biohazard label on it taped to the side of the plastic-lined compartment, but was interrupted by the Professor putting a hand over hers.\n\n\n\n\"Wait here,\" the old man said. \"I'll let you know if you need to worry.\"\n\n\n\nHe exited the makeshift quarantine compartment in the back of the van and walked to the side of the road, where Michel was now sitting with his knees pulled to his chest and tears streaming down his face. The Professor sat down next to the big Frenchman and put an arm around his wide shoulders, pulling him close. \"I'm sorry,\" he said, simply. \"It needed to be done.\"\n\n\n\n\"Did we have to do it like THAT!?\" Michel asked. \"That was\u2026 UGLY\u2026 it was\u2026\"\n\n\n\n\"I know,\" the Professor said. \"I know. It was an unpleasant, hideous act to do to another human being. But so was what she did to Kevin. Justice needed to be done. A lesson needed to be taught.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm done,\" Michel said. \"I can't do this any more. Not after that.\"\n\n\n\nThe Professor nodded, and hugged the big man again. \"You're a good soldier, Michel,\" he said. \"You have fought well for the cause. Go home and be with your loved ones and enjoy the new world you are creating. Thank you for your service.\"\n\n\n\nHe helped the big man get to his feet and led him to the van. The rest of the trip passed in silence. Nothing needed to be said. Everyone understood.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nShe didn't remember much except that it was incredibly unpleasant and incredibly humiliating. On top of the pain of the serum racing through her body, there was the devastating effect it had on a body that had developed an equilibrium with billions of different kinds of lethal microorganisms, as well as many which were nonlethal. The effect on her digestive system alone didn't even bear thinking about.\n\n\n\nThe worst part where the nightmares. Every time she closed her eyes, she saw demons in white coats and surgical masks wielding syringes full of death. White rooms lit with fluorescent tubes that cast no shadows. A man with no head cut her apart with a scalpel, held the pieces up to the light, then dunked them in a greenish liquid and put them back where they had come from. Grinning midgets with wide mouths full of too many sharklike teeth sat in the rafters and cackled. \"You'll never get out. You'll never get out.\"\n\n\n\nThe only comfort was when the Angel came. That was how she thought of him, for in her pain-induced delirium, his handsome face seemed suffused in a holy light. The Angel was the one who would wipe away her sweat from her feverish forehead. The Angel was the one who cleaned her up and changed her IVs. He held her hand throughout the worst of the pain, and whispered soft lullabies to her when she whimpered. \n\n\n\nIn her hour of loneliness, he was her friend, and she loved him for it.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nWhen she finally emerged from her drug-induced delirium, she found herself lying on clean sheets in a soft bed. The sun was shining through a window in the attic room, casting a square of light onto the cheerful flower-print wallpaper. There was a framed cross-stitch on the wall across from her depicting two children playing on the front lawn of a red brick house. \"HOME IS WHERE THE HEART IS,\" it read.\n\n\n\nShe felt empty\u2026 drained\u2026 alone. For the first time since she could remember, she was a single person, without the familiar warmth of her old friends nestled inside her. She closed her eyes and reached out, calling to her beloved microscopic companions: a virus here, a bacterium there. She called them to her, and they answered, and as they did so, she felt her strength return to her, felt her broken spirit rejuvenating.\n\n\n\nThe door opened, and a young man wearing an apron over his jeans and t-shirt walked in, carrying a large hot bowl of chicken soup. \"Feeling better?\" he asked, setting it down by her side. \"It's good to see you awake again.\"\n\n\n\nVector looked up into his face, and she blushed. It was the Angel.\n\n\n\n\"Don't get up just yet,\" he said. \"Let me check your vital signs first.\" He sat down next to her and checked her pulse and blood pressure, nodded at the numbers. \"Much better,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"How long was I out?\" she asked.\n\n\n\n\"About a week. How are you feeling?\" the young man asked.\n\n\n\n\"Better,\" Vector said. She twisted the sheets under her fingers tightly, nervously.\n\n\n\n\"You look better,\" the young man said kindly. \"Is there something I can do for you?\"\n\n\n\nShe felt a familiar taste in the air, and she smiled. \"Yes,\" she whispered. \"You can die.\"\n\n\n\nStaphylococcus aureus is a contradictory bacteria. It is constantly present in the environment: on the skin, in the mucus membranes of the nose and throat, in acne. Approximately one in five humans is a carrier and, for the most part, coexist with it in relative peace. However, that same bacteria, which is harmless enough in most places, turns into one of the most virulent and deadly organisms known to man if allowed to infect the wrong tissues. In the skin, it causes necrotizing fasciitis, which literally eats skin and muscle tissue at an alarming rate. In the blood, it causes toxic shock syndrome, which can kill in hours. In spinal fluid, it causes meningitis, which can lead to brain damage and gangrene. In the lungs, pneumonia.\n\n\n\nVector hit him with all of them at once, then boosted the virulence as hard as she could. He was dead within seconds. \n\n\n\nShe stepped around over his twitching, decaying body and went to the wardrobe in the corner. As expected, all the clothes were some sort of hideous floral print frocks that looked like something a mother from a Norman Rockwell painting would wear. She picked the least disgusting looking one and changed into it, then threw an overcoat on over it. No shoes, but if she could just. . . \n\n\n\nThere was a loud crash, and then shouting. Gunfire cracked in bright, staccato beats: the high, bright crack of an assault rifle, underlaid by the lower booming of a shotgun. Then silence.\n\n\n\nShe ran to the window. There were men outside, wearing black tactical gear, and they were dragging two dead bodies into the back of an unmarked white van. Several more were moving towards the house with the smooth, practiced movements of professional soldiers. A couple more were pushing a nondescript white Toyota Camry off the dock and into a nearby lake: it splashed into the water and quickly sank from view.\n\n\n\nThe door opened, and a man wearing full hazmat gear, carrying a submachine gun, walked in. He held up a photo and nodded. \"It's her.\"\n\n\n\nAnother man slung his rifle and drew a pistol, shooting her twice in the chest. She looked down and saw the yellow tassel of a dart sticking from her body, then the drugs took hold, and she passed out.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n\"This is Bobby. Tell Dark we have her.\"\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nHarken woke up around midnight with the distinct feeling there was someone in the room. Then he saw the silhouette standing at his window: the silhouette of a tall man wearing a fedora and long overcoat.\n\n\n\n\"You must think you're very clever, Mister Harken,\" the stranger said.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2026 ahh\u2026 like to think so, yes.\u201d\n\n\n\n\"I will admit, your ruse was almost successful.\"\n\n\n\nHarken thought for several seconds about denying it, but didn't see the point. \u201cOnly almost?\u201d\n\n\n\n\"Just so. Let me tell you about the full consequences of your actions, Mister Harken,\" the stranger continued. \"Because of your\u2026 tip\u2026 the GOC pulled elements from their strike team shadowing the girl known as 'Vector' to investigate the warehouse in question. The strike team was seconds away from breach when the overwatch element recognized the person known as \"Boomer.\" They were barely able to abort the mission before what would certainly have been a costly and fatal mistake.\"\n\n\n\n\"Damn. Well, good on them. No harm no foul, I suppose?\"\n\n\n\n\"But there was harm, Mister Harken. Because the GOC diverted elements to the warehouse, they dispatched only two agents to investigate the next likely lead: a farmhouse in Colorado. When they arrived, the agents were ambushed and killed. Shortly afterward, a UAV doing surveillance of the region showed several known employees of Marshall, Carter, and Dark carrying an unconscious female in her mid-twenties to an unmarked vehicle. The female was later confirmed to be the target in question.\"\n\n\n\nHarken felt his mouth go dry. He swallowed hard. \"The richies got the germ girl.\"\n\n\n\n\"All thanks to your little 'tip,' Mister Harken. All thanks to your little tip.\" The stranger walked to the bathroom door and waited with one hand on the handle. \"Mister Harken. This is a war. You and yours need to seriously consider whose side you are on.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah? And whose side are you on?\" Harken growled.\n\n\n\n\"You already know the answer to that, Mister Harken,\" the man said. \"I'm on Nobody's side.\"\n\n\n\nHe walked into the bathroom and closed the door behind him. Harken already knew that by the time anyone else opened that door, it would be empty. He still rose and threw the door open on the cool, tile lined darkness. Not surprising, really.\n\n\n\nAfter all, Nobody could get out of a locked room with only one door.\n\n\n\nHe sighed heavily, thinking of the report he'd have to file, leaning on the door frame.\n\n\n\n\u201cKramer's never gonna let me hear the end of this.\u201d\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>\n\n|author=DrClef and Dr Gears]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "licensing-guide", "licensing-master-list"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "co-authored", "game-day", "global-occult-coalition", "marshall-carter-and-dark", "nobody", "tale"], "title": "Point In Line - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/gdp2-point-in-line", "year": 2011}, "gdp2-second-language": {"created_at": "2011-11-01T01:51:00", "creator": "eric_h", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "eric_h", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/eric-h", "comment": "", "date": "2011-11-01T01:51:00"}, {"author": "eric_h", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/eric-h", "comment": "", "date": "2011-11-01T02:47:00"}, {"author": "DrClef", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drclef", "comment": "", "date": "2011-11-01T15:43:00"}, {"author": "Aelanna", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aelanna", "comment": "Added tags: collaboration, tale.

It was glorious to finally possess a mind capable of holding thousands of years of thoughts, with room to spare. No more screaming: at least, not from him.

He helped Walters load Clarkson onto a gurney and wheeled him out. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou said you had something of ours?\u201d Walters asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, yes.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0343 casually picked up [[[SCP-911]]] and dropped it into the waiting bag.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t touch it; it may still be omnivorous.\u00a0\u00a0Er, I mean, anomalous.\u00a0\u00a0I think I need a nap.\u201d \n\n\n\n\"Don't we all. I'll be seeing you, sir,\" Walters said. He took SCP-911 and headed for Temporary Containment Area C.\u00a0\u00a0Eventually, someone would get the door to High Value Item Storage repaired.\n\n\n\nThe Collector closed the door to his new room and smiled. It was glorious to finally possess a mind capable of holding thousands of years of thoughts, with room to spare. No more screaming: at least, not from him. It had been in Clarkson\u2019s thoughts, something he had learned in a lecture from someone called \u201cAssistant Director Clef.\u201d What odd names people had these days.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cThe greatest weakness of Reality Benders is their overconfidence,\u201d Clef had said, and someday --343-- 911 would be pleased to tell Clef that he was correct. Until then, there was plenty of time for him to learn the intricacies of reality bending. And English.\n\n\n\nHe closed his eyes and began taking his nap.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>\n\n|author=DrClef and eric_h]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["scp-911", "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "licensing-guide", "licensing-master-list"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "alleged-god", "co-authored", "doctor-clef", "game-day", "tale"], "title": "Game Day Phase 2: Second Language - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/gdp2-second-language", "year": 2011}, "gdp2-sometimes-you-get-the-bear": {"created_at": "2011-11-01T17:40:00", "creator": "DrClef", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "DrClef", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drclef", "comment": "", "date": "2011-11-01T17:40:00"}, {"author": "DrClef", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drclef", "comment": "", "date": "2011-11-01T17:44:00"}, {"author": "DrClef", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drclef", "comment": "", "date": "2011-11-01T18:02:00"}, {"author": "thedeadlymoose", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/thedeadlymoose", "comment": "Added tags: game_day, tale.

He sighed, shook his head, and growled out the word, \"Holocaust,\" through the bit in his teeth.</p>\n<p>The woman immediately stopped moaning and stood up straight, concern in her ice-blue eyes. \"Are you okay, sweetie?\" she asked.</p>\n<p>\"I'm fine,\" he said. \"I'm just not feeling it today.\"</p>\n<p>\"It's okay, hon. Let's call it for today. Call me when you're ready to go again.\"</p>\n<p>\"I will,\" he lied.</p>\n<p>He paid the woman in cash and watched her drive away down the winding country road, sipping his tea and touching his stomach where she had run the stage knife over his bare skin, leaving behind a thin line of fake blood. It wasn't her fault she couldn't give him what he wanted. No professional was going to do actual bloodplay in this day and age, not with the threat of HIV ever-present. But even the most convincing play was simply that\u2026 a shadow of the truth.</p>\n<p>He wondered if that was how She felt.</p>\n<p>She was sitting on a large rock in the backyard when he came downstairs, running a fine-toothed steel comb through Her tangled black hair, picking fleas out when they got caught between the narrow tines and crushing them between Her thumb and forefinger. She was rail-thin and rangy-looking, Her ribs visible through Her taut skin, Her yellow eyes feral and cruel, Her too-wide mouth crooked upwards, revealing the white tips of Her sharp canine teeth. The decapitated remnants of a dead hare were scattered here and there.</p>\n<p>\"Did you have a good hunt?\" Sol asked.</p>\n<p>\"I did. It has been a long time,\" She replied. \"Fresh blood tastes best. But is it safe to hunt so close to my former captors?\"</p>\n<p>\"Who said you were anywhere near them?\" Sol laughed. \"We're halfway around the world from that place. You're perfectly safe for the time being.\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't remember any planes,\" She pointed out. \"And I somehow doubt that you could drive all the way across the world in a few short minutes.\"</p>\n<p>\"You'd be right about that\u2026 assuming you were taking the long way. It so happens that I know a few shortcuts.\"</p>\n<p>\"Interesting. Tell me more.\"</p>\n<p>\"In due time, my lady. In due time. For now you must focus on regaining your strength and re-honing your skills. You are like a blade allowed to rust in darkness. You must be polished, sharpened, and remade anew.\"</p>\n<p>Her ears twitched, and She grinned. \"If you say so,\" She purred.</p>\n<p>\"I do say so. You are a sublime creature of legend. I would have the others see you in your full glory, rather than as this wretched creature that the Worldwide Global Conspiracy has reduced you to. So for now, rest, my lady, and grow strong and beautiful. The day of reckoning will come soon enough.\"</p>\n<p>He kissed the back of her hand and walked back into the house. She waited until he was gone before picking up the severed head of the hare and hurling it into the woods in a fit of pique. She longed to follow him into the house and paint the ceiling and walls with his guts, but if there was one thing Her long captivity had taught Her, it was patience. Good things came to those who waited.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"Oh lord, give me the serenity to accept what I cannot change, the courage to change what I can, and the patience not to punch that asshole in the face for being a sententious prick,\" Sandra recited.</p>\n<p>\"Try to be nice. He's technically our ally,\" Michel said.</p>\n<p>\"Ally my ass, he's a loose cannon. If I thought I could get away with it\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"Hush, Sandra,\" the Professor said. \"We're here.\"</p>\n<p>Every time James came to the Teacher's home, he felt like he was stepping into Narnia. The old country manor looked like something straight out of an Edward Gorey illustration, with its tall picture windows and dilapidated clock tower, and the forest behind it swept out as far as the eye could see: dark, mysterious, and overgrown. The entire place radiated a sense of adventure, tradition, and mysticism that never failed to make him shiver with excitement.</p>\n<p>He'd tried to say as much to Sandra once. \"I know,\" she'd agreed, \"If he bothered to spend a little time and money to fix up the clock tower, renovate the house, and prune the trees back a bit, the place would be worth something. Lazy bastard.\" After that, James decided to keep his opinions to himself.</p>\n<p>The door opened as the four of them approached, and James heard Sandra breathe in sharply, followed by a, \"What the fuck?\" from Michel. Sol was standing in the doorway dressed in some kind of insane gold-brocaded robe with massive sleeves, smiling and nodding to his guests. \"Come in,\" he said. \"Dinner will be served shortly.\"</p>\n<p>The walls of the front hall were hung with hand-drawn screens and red silks: they tried but didn't quite succeed at covering up the portraits of English gentlemen and such that hung on the walls. A red velvet carpet had been rolled out leading from the front door into the dining room. It was grotesque. It was gaudy. It was ugly.</p>\n<p>It was classic Sol.</p>\n<p>\"What the hell is going on here, Sol?\" Sandra growled. \"I don't have time for your bullshit.\"</p>\n<p>\"In good time, in good time, my friends. For now, I have a guest for you to meet.\"</p>\n<p>\"No! Fuck you!\" Sandra shouted. \"You'll answer my questions right now! What the fuck was up with that stupid manifesto you sent to the news stations? When we said we were going to help you with your raid, you promised us that you had everything planned out. Nothing could go wrong. Well, I've got three dead cell members and a bunch of wounded that say otherwise. And what did we get for it? Jack and SHIT. A few trinkets we could have picked up easier ourselves without getting a bunch of guys killed. I want a goddamn explanation!\"</p>\n<p>Sol's expression darkened, and he swallowed his rage hard, fists tightening. \"As usual, your mercenary ways don't see the truth of what we've accomplished. We have struck a blow for freedom and liberty that will resound all around the world. We have liberated\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, SPARE me your righteous bullshit, Sol! I want answers!\"</p>\n<p>\"My apologies,\" a new voice said. \"The master is wise indeed, but is often short in social graces.\"</p>\n<p>James let out an involuntary squeak of surprise. An angel was walking into the room.</p>\n<p>She was small in stature, and dressed in the same gaudy robes that Sol wore, but while he looked like a child playing dressup with his parents' clothing, she wore them with confidence and assurance. Her pale face was round and lovely, and her long, jet-black hair tied up in a series of tight buns. But what really drew James' attention was the pair of tapered, red-furred ears that jutted out through her jet-black locks, and the tips of nine foxlike tails peeking out from the hem of her robes. \"Please,\" she said. \"It is not proper for friends to fight. Please come inside and have dinner.\"</p>\n<p>The silence was finally broken when the Professor let out a low sigh. \"Solomon,\" he said. \"What have you done?\"</p>\n<p>\"I have rescued a being of myth from durance vile, and struck a blow against the Worldwide Global Conspiracy that will be felt for many years to come,\" Sol crowed.</p>\n<p>Sandra's angry response was interrupted by the Professor's cutting hand gesture: very small, but enough for her to see. She clenched her teeth instead, and looked away.</p>\n<p>\"Let us by all means have dinner, then,\" the Professor said calmly. \"I believe we have much to discuss.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"Our attack on the Enemy has borne great fruit,\" Sol expounded, making grandiose and voluminous gestures at the walls, the ceiling, and his bowl of rice. \"Dozens of sentients cruelly held captive now taste the sweet honey of freedom. Though most are happy to simply enjoy the fresh air of liberty, they will soon answer our clarion call to join the crusade against the Worldwide Global Conspiracy that enslaves us all. Already, the first of them have joined us in our war against evil\u2026 and I have heard that one even now strikes back against the enemy on her own.\"</p>\n<p>\"If you mean that Vector bitch, then I don't know where you're getting your information. That crazy whore is in it for herself, not for any cause,\" Sandra muttered angrily.</p>\n<p>\"She strikes against the minions of the Conspiracy. Her cause and ours are the same.\"</p>\n<p>\"Forgive me, Sol, if I don't think that attacking an AIDS clinic and killing a bunch of sick people to steal their strains of HIV is particularly helpful in fighting the GOC.\"</p>\n<p>\"You are as short-sighted as usual, Sandra. Clearly you must see\u2026\"</p>\n<p>It was always like this. Sandra and Sol would argue. Michel would sit by and watch in silence. And the Professor would just listen and then, at the right moment, make a single cutting remark that would make both Sandra and Sol realize how stupid they were being. And as for James? He just sat there, listened, and felt like a fifth wheel. It was not a comfortable feeling, and it was even more uncomfortable this time because of the presence of the Girl.</p>\n<p>He glanced over at her, and saw her looking back. He blushed and looked down at his half-eaten plate of food, the bright colors of the vegetables and the gently bubbling soups arranged impeccably on the black laquered table. With shaking hands, he reached for his wine cup, found it empty. Almost immediately, she was there at his side, pouring him another cupful from a glass bottle.</p>\n<p>Her hands, he noticed, were very white, and her fingers were very delicate and tipped with long, red-painted nails.</p>\n<p>\"Is your food not to your liking?\" she asked, in a voice like bells in the wind. \"You have barely touched it.\"</p>\n<p>\"It\u2026 it's fine,\" James stammered. He stared down at his food and picked up some kind of sliced vegetable with his chopsticks, but his hands were shaking so badly that he dropped it into his lap. She laughed, not unkindly, and placed a hand over his. \"Here,\" she said. \"Let me.\"</p>\n<p>She picked up one of the small white pancakes from the center of the nine-sectioned dish and deftly placed a few sections of sliced vegetables and meats atop it. She wrapped it up with a few quick moves of her chopsticks and held it out to him in her chopsticks. James blinked in surprise, then, feeling embarassed, allowed her to feed it to him.</p>\n<p>A loud laugh, and he suddenly realized everyone was watching him. \"Is she not wonderful?\" Sol said, with a wry smile. \"A truly exquisite creature. And the Worldwide Global Conspiracy would keep her captive. Is her freedom not enough to justify our crusade against them?\"</p>\n<p>\"Funny you should call it that, considering what happened during the Crusades,\" Sandra muttered.</p>\n<p>And again, the conversation devolved back into the usual argument. But James noticed that Her yellow eyes were watching him.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>In the end, they ended up staying the night.</p>\n<p>James couldn't sleep. It was 2 am and he was laying in bed staring up at the ceiling. His mind was haunted by the image of a pair of lovely yellow eyes staring back at him, his dreams by the memory of the touch of her cool fingertips against his wrist. Though an early fall breeze cooled the room, the air seemed uncomfortably close and warm\u2026 stifling, even. He closed his eyes, and all he could see was the soft cupid's bow curve of her lips - all he could hear the ringing musical sound of her laughter.</p>\n<p>He got up from his bed to get a drink of water, but something out of the corner of his eye caught his attention. He went to his window to get a closer look, and his breath caught in his throat.</p>\n<p>She was sitting on a large rock in the backyard, running a lacquered tortoiseshell comb through Her long, black hair. She was slender and lovely, Her pale white skin glowing like pearl in the silver moonlight, her gleaming yellow eyes vibrant with life. A divinely lovely smile quirked her pale pink lips as flower petals cascaded down around her like snowflakes.</p>\n<p>James swallowed hard.</p>\n<p>He went to his door and opened it, then gave a cry of surprise. Michel, the huge, muscular Frenchman, was sitting outside his door, wrapped in a blanket, with his head cushioned by a pillow. He instantly awoke as he heard the door open. \"What is it?\" Michel asked.</p>\n<p>\"I was uh\u2026 just going to get a glass of water,\" James stammered.</p>\n<p>Michel nodded. \"Go back to your room. I'll get it for you.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm not a kid, Mick. I can get my own water.\"</p>\n<p>\"James?\" Michel said, slowly. \"Go back into your room.\"</p>\n<p>\"Fu\u2014\" He never finished the sentence. Michel's massive fist lashed out and punched him in the jaw, knocking him out cold.</p>\n<p>\"Sorry, kid,\" Michel said. \"I'm saving your life.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>She heard the footsteps behind Her, and She smiled. It had been a long time since She had hunted man, and She was glad that She had not lost her touch. She turned towards him, letting her back arch in a carefully calculated move that framed Her face with her black hair in the most flattering manner possible\u2026 and was surprised to see the old man standing there on the garden path.</p>\n<p>\"Good evening,\" he said. \"Lovely moon out tonight.\"</p>\n<p>She smiled at him, quickly recovering from Her surprise. Though not the prey She had anticipated, She would make do with this. \"It is,\" She admitted. lowering Her eyes in Her most demure manner, and covering Her bare shoulders with Her long flowing locks. \"It reminds me of the moons of my childhood.\"</p>\n<p>\"You must miss them. The days of long ago. You speak of them with such nostalgia.\"</p>\n<p>\"It was a different time, back then,\" She said, letting her hair slip in a perfectly calculated manner to bare the back of Her neck. \"Things were simpler. Now times have changed.\"</p>\n<p>There was a short pause. \"I am seventy years old,\" the man said. \"I am not a young man driven by base lusts. Don't try to seduce me like you did James.\"</p>\n<p>This was not going as She had expected. \"Even a seventy year old man has needs,\" She purred, tossing Her hair back and letting him get a good look at Her body. \"I could make you feel young agai\u2014.\"</p>\n<p>\"Why do you do this?\" he asked. \"It demeans you to carry on like a cheap whore.\"</p>\n<p>She hissed in anger, and for a moment, She lost her concentration on the illusion She was spinning. For a bare instant, he saw Her as She truly was, and the sight made him flinch in shock, but only for a moment. \"Insult me again, prey-creature, and I will tear your heart out with my claws. I could kill you in an instant.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, you could,\" he admitted. \"But what would that accomplish?\"</p>\n<p>\"It would be what you deserve for doing this to me!\" She snapped. \"Your people have killed the Old. They have bound Myth and Legend in prisons of steel, and eradicated the things of Magic with cold science. Then you mock even our memories, perverting that which you should fear into things of lust and children's fantasies. This cannot be abided. I will NOT abide it! I will die, but I will die fighting, with my claws red with your blood and my teeth in your throat, and I will die knowing that I was feared!\"</p>\n<p>The wind blew, and carried with it the smell of rot and decay. The old man smiled. \"Yes,\" he said. \"This is the real you. This is what I was looking for.\"</p>\n<p>\"What are you talking about?\"</p>\n<p>\"You have heard Solomon's plans?\"</p>\n<p>\"Idiocy. The man thinks that he can go to war with the world and win. He is useful to me for now, but one of these days, I will taste his blood,\" She growled.</p>\n<p>\"Sol is\u2026 a broken man, but he is also a useful one. He has a talent for inspiring fools and martyrs, and we have need of both in these days. Go along with his plans for now,\" the old man said. \"Help him fight his war.\"</p>\n<p>\"Why? It is doomed to fail. He has no subtlety. He will push and push, and when he pushes too far, they will strike back with all their might, and destroy him.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" the old man said. \"That is exactly what we want.\"</p>\n<p>He spoke to her then of plans, of plans within plans, of war and betrayal, and of things to come. He told her of the coming war, of the fire that would cleanse the world clean, and of the new world that would rise from the ashes of the old. He told her of many things, and as She listened, She felt something She had not felt in many years.</p>\n<p>Respect.</p>\n<p><em>At last,</em> She thought. <em>A human who TRULY understands.</em></p>\n<p>He finished speaking. She nodded. \"I will do as you have said,\" She admitted. \"But I have only one question.\"</p>\n<p>\"Ask.\"</p>\n<p>\"Who are you?\"</p>\n<p>\"My name is a secret,\" the old man said, \"but most call me The Teacher.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>They left with the dawn: James holding an icepack to his jaw and arguing with the stoic Michel the whole drive home, while Sandra and the Professor listened on in increasingly uncomfortable silence. Sol watched the drive away, then walked into the backyard, where She was sitting and looking out into the forest.</p>\n<p>\"So,\" he asked. \"What did you think of my friends?\"</p>\n<p>\"They seem like decent folk,\" She said. \"But they lack your vision and daring.\"</p>\n<p>Sol nodded, and put one hand in his pocket and ran the other along a windowsill. \"You know, last night, after everyone had gone to bed, I went to the bathroom. On my way back to the room, I walked by this window, when I thought I heard someone talking. I heard an interesting conversation. I don't think they realized this window was open the whole time.\"</p>\n<p>She was silent for a moment. \"You know I didn't mean anything I said,\" She purred. \"I said what I did to draw him out as a traitor. I would never betray you, not after all you've done for me.\"</p>\n<p>\"I hear you,\" Sol sighed. \"But I can't take that chance.\"</p>\n<p>He shot her twice in the head, saw her fall to the ground dead. He shook his head in regret. \"Pity,\" he whispered. \"I thought you, of all people, would understand.\"</p>\n<p>\"I did,\" a voice whispered, and Sol knew he was dead.</p>\n<p>She bit his hand off at the wrist first, and it fell to the ground still holding the gun. That part was fast. The rest went much slower. About the time that she tore open his abdomen and started pulling his guts out of his body, he realized he had an erection.</p>\n<p>His last thought before dying was that this was what he'd wanted all along.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The first thing She did was tear down the decorations and burn them in the back yard along with the uneaten portions of his body. She threw the robes onto the fire as well, feeling a sense of vindictive satisfaction as they curled and blackened. Then She walked back into the house and stood in front of the mirror.</p>\n<p>Solomon Kidd looked back at Her. She frowned as She noticed a slight imperfection in the shape of his eyes, then fixed it with a small exertion of will. She would have to practice walking, She realized, in order to get just enough arrogance and braggadocio into all Her movements.</p>\n<p>Then She went upstairs to his office, took the small post-it from the back of his monitor, and used the username and password written there to log on to his account. She spent the rest of the afternoon reading through his emails and correspondence, learning how to become Solomon Kidd.</p>\n<p>It was shortly after the sun had set that She read one that made Her smile.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Re: Stepping Sideways<br/>\nFrom: <span class=\"wiki-email\">ten.srerednaw|yttikssim#ten.srerednaw|yttikssim</span><br/>\nTo: <span class=\"wiki-email\">ten.noitandnimeerf|loS#ten.noitandnimeerf|loS</span></p>\n<p>I'll help you on this, but just this once.

Sol was standing in the doorway dressed in some kind of insane gold-brocaded robe with massive sleeves, smiling and nodding to his guests. \"Come in,\" he said. \"Dinner will be served shortly.\"\n\n\n\nThe walls of the front hall were hung with hand-drawn screens and red silks: they tried but didn't quite succeed at covering up the portraits of English gentlemen and such that hung on the walls. A red velvet carpet had been rolled out leading from the front door into the dining room. It was grotesque. It was gaudy. It was ugly. \n\n\n\nIt was classic Sol.\n\n\n\n\"What the hell is going on here, Sol?\" Sandra growled. \"I don't have time for your bullshit.\"\n\n\n\n\"In good time, in good time, my friends. For now, I have a guest for you to meet.\"\n\n\n\n\"No! Fuck you!\" Sandra shouted. \"You'll answer my questions right now! What the fuck was up with that stupid manifesto you sent to the news stations? When we said we were going to help you with your raid, you promised us that you had everything planned out. Nothing could go wrong. Well, I've got three dead cell members and a bunch of wounded that say otherwise. And what did we get for it? Jack and SHIT. A few trinkets we could have picked up easier ourselves without getting a bunch of guys killed. I want a goddamn explanation!\"\n\n\n\nSol's expression darkened, and he swallowed his rage hard, fists tightening. \"As usual, your mercenary ways don't see the truth of what we've accomplished. We have struck a blow for freedom and liberty that will resound all around the world. We have liberated. . .\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, SPARE me your righteous bullshit, Sol! I want answers!\"\n\n\n\n\"My apologies,\" a new voice said. \"The master is wise indeed, but is often short in social graces.\"\n\n\n\nJames let out an involuntary squeak of surprise. An angel was walking into the room. \n\n\n\nShe was small in stature, and dressed in the same gaudy robes that Sol wore, but while he looked like a child playing dressup with his parents' clothing, she wore them with confidence and assurance. Her pale face was round and lovely, and her long, jet-black hair tied up in a series of tight buns. But what really drew James' attention was the pair of tapered, red-furred ears that jutted out through her jet-black locks, and the tips of nine foxlike tails peeking out from the hem of her robes. \"Please,\" she said. \"It is not proper for friends to fight. Please come inside and have dinner.\"\n\n\n\nThe silence was finally broken when the Professor let out a low sigh. \"Solomon,\" he said. \"What have you done?\"\n\n\n\n\"I have rescued a being of myth from durance vile, and struck a blow against the Worldwide Global Conspiracy that will be felt for many years to come,\" Sol crowed.\n\n\n\nSandra's angry response was interrupted by the Professor's cutting hand gesture: very small, but enough for her to see. She clenched her teeth instead, and looked away.\n\n\n\n\"Let us by all means have dinner, then,\" the Professor said calmly. \"I believe we have much to discuss.\"\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\"Our attack on the Enemy has borne great fruit,\" Sol expounded, making grandiose and voluminous gestures at the walls, the ceiling, and his bowl of rice. \"Dozens of sentients cruelly held captive now taste the sweet honey of freedom. Though most are happy to simply enjoy the fresh air of liberty, they will soon answer our clarion call to join the crusade against the Worldwide Global Conspiracy that enslaves us all. Already, the first of them have joined us in our war against evil. . . and I have heard that one even now strikes back against the enemy on her own.\"\n\n\n\n\"If you mean that Vector bitch, then I don't know where you're getting your information. That crazy whore is in it for herself, not for any cause,\" Sandra muttered angrily.\n\n\n\n\"She strikes against the minions of the Conspiracy. Her cause and ours are the same.\"\n\n\n\n\"Forgive me, Sol, if I don't think that attacking an AIDS clinic and killing a bunch of sick people to steal their strains of HIV is particularly helpful in fighting the GOC.\"\n\n\n\n\"You are as short-sighted as usual, Sandra. Clearly you must see. . .\"\n\n\n\nIt was always like this. Sandra and Sol would argue. Michel would sit by and watch in silence. And the Professor would just listen and then, at the right moment, make a single cutting remark that would make both Sandra and Sol realize how stupid they were being. And as for James? He just sat there, listened, and felt like a fifth wheel. It was not a comfortable feeling, and it was even more uncomfortable this time because of the presence of the Girl.\n\n\n\nHe glanced over at her, and saw her looking back. He blushed and looked down at his half-eaten plate of food, the bright colors of the vegetables and the gently bubbling soups arranged impeccably on the black laquered table. With shaking hands, he reached for his wine cup, found it empty. Almost immediately, she was there at his side, pouring him another cupful from a glass bottle. \n\n\n\nHer hands, he noticed, were very white, and her fingers were very delicate and tipped with long, red-painted nails.\n\n\n\n\"Is your food not to your liking?\" she asked, in a voice like bells in the wind. \"You have barely touched it.\"\n\n\n\n\"It. . . it's fine,\" James stammered. He stared down at his food and picked up some kind of sliced vegetable with his chopsticks, but his hands were shaking so badly that he dropped it into his lap. She laughed, not unkindly, and placed a hand over his. \"Here,\" she said. \"Let me.\"\n\n\n\nShe picked up one of the small white pancakes from the center of the nine-sectioned dish and deftly placed a few sections of sliced vegetables and meats atop it. She wrapped it up with a few quick moves of her chopsticks and held it out to him in her chopsticks. James blinked in surprise, then, feeling embarassed, allowed her to feed it to him. \n\n\n\nA loud laugh, and he suddenly realized everyone was watching him. \"Is she not wonderful?\" Sol said, with a wry smile. \"A truly exquisite creature. And the Worldwide Global Conspiracy would keep her captive. Is her freedom not enough to justify our crusade against them?\"\n\n\n\n\"Funny you should call it that, considering what happened during the Crusades,\" Sandra muttered.\n\n\n\nAnd again, the conversation devolved back into the usual argument. But James noticed that Her yellow eyes were watching him. \n\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the end, they ended up staying the night.\n\n\n\nJames couldn't sleep. It was 2 am and he was laying in bed staring up at the ceiling. His mind was haunted by the image of a pair of lovely yellow eyes staring back at him, his dreams by the memory of the touch of her cool fingertips against his wrist. Though an early fall breeze cooled the room, the air seemed uncomfortably close and warm. . . stifling, even. He closed his eyes, and all he could see was the soft cupid's bow curve of her lips - all he could hear the ringing musical sound of her laughter.\n\n\n\nHe got up from his bed to get a drink of water, but something out of the corner of his eye caught his attention. He went to his window to get a closer look, and his breath caught in his throat. \n\n\n\nShe was sitting on a large rock in the backyard, running a lacquered tortoiseshell comb through Her long, black hair. She was slender and lovely, Her pale white skin glowing like pearl in the silver moonlight, her gleaming yellow eyes vibrant with life. A divinely lovely smile quirked her pale pink lips as flower petals cascaded down around her like snowflakes.\n\n\n\nJames swallowed hard.\n\n\n\nHe went to his door and opened it, then gave a cry of surprise. Michel, the huge, muscular Frenchman, was sitting outside his door, wrapped in a blanket, with his head cushioned by a pillow. He instantly awoke as he heard the door open. \"What is it?\" Michel asked.\n\n\n\n\"I was uh. . . just going to get a glass of water,\" James stammered.\n\n\n\nMichel nodded. \"Go back to your room. I'll get it for you.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm not a kid, Mick. I can get my own water.\"\n\n\n\n\"James?\" Michel said, slowly. \"Go back into your room.\"\n\n\n\n\"Fu--\" He never finished the sentence. Michel's massive fist lashed out and punched him in the jaw, knocking him out cold.\n\n\n\n\"Sorry, kid,\" Michel said. \"I'm saving your life.\"\n\n\n\n-----\n\nShe heard the footsteps behind Her, and She smiled. It had been a long time since She had hunted man, and She was glad that She had not lost her touch. She turned towards him, letting her back arch in a carefully calculated move that framed Her face with her black hair in the most flattering manner possible. . . and was surprised to see the old man standing there on the garden path.\n\n\n\n\"Good evening,\" he said. \"Lovely moon out tonight.\"\n\n\n\nShe smiled at him, quickly recovering from Her surprise. Though not the prey She had anticipated, She would make do with this. \"It is,\" She admitted. lowering Her eyes in Her most demure manner, and covering Her bare shoulders with Her long flowing locks. \"It reminds me of the moons of my childhood.\"\n\n\n\n\"You must miss them. The days of long ago. You speak of them with such nostalgia.\"\n\n\n\n\"It was a different time, back then,\" She said, letting her hair slip in a perfectly calculated manner to bare the back of Her neck. \"Things were simpler. Now times have changed.\"\n\n\n\nThere was a short pause. \"I am seventy years old,\" the man said. \"I am not a young man driven by base lusts. Don't try to seduce me like you did James.\"\n\n\n\nThis was not going as She had expected. \"Even a seventy year old man has needs,\" She purred, tossing Her hair back and letting him get a good look at Her body. \"I could make you feel young agai--.\"\n\n\n\n\"Why do you do this?\" he asked. \"It demeans you to carry on like a cheap whore.\"\n\n\n\nShe hissed in anger, and for a moment, She lost her concentration on the illusion She was spinning. For a bare instant, he saw Her as She truly was, and the sight made him flinch in shock, but only for a moment. \"Insult me again, prey-creature, and I will tear your heart out with my claws. I could kill you in an instant.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes, you could,\" he admitted. \"But what would that accomplish?\"\n\n\n\n\"It would be what you deserve for doing this to me!\" She snapped. \"Your people have killed the Old. They have bound Myth and Legend in prisons of steel, and eradicated the things of Magic with cold science. Then you mock even our memories, perverting that which you should fear into things of lust and children's fantasies. This cannot be abided. I will NOT abide it! I will die, but I will die fighting, with my claws red with your blood and my teeth in your throat, and I will die knowing that I was feared!\"\n\n\n\nThe wind blew, and carried with it the smell of rot and decay. The old man smiled. \"Yes,\" he said. \"This is the real you. This is what I was looking for.\"\n\n\n\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\n\n\n\"You have heard Solomon's plans?\"\n\n\n\n\"Idiocy. The man thinks that he can go to war with the world and win. He is useful to me for now, but one of these days, I will taste his blood,\" She growled.\n\n\n\n\"Sol is. . . a broken man, but he is also a useful one. He has a talent for inspiring fools and martyrs, and we have need of both in these days. Go along with his plans for now,\" the old man said. \"Help him fight his war.\"\n\n\n\n\"Why? It is doomed to fail. He has no subtlety. He will push and push, and when he pushes too far, they will strike back with all their might, and destroy him.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes,\" the old man said. \"That is exactly what we want.\"\n\n\n\nHe spoke to her then of plans, of plans within plans, of war and betrayal, and of things to come. He told her of the coming war, of the fire that would cleanse the world clean, and of the new world that would rise from the ashes of the old. He told her of many things, and as She listened, She felt something She had not felt in many years. \n\n\n\nRespect.\n\n\n\n//At last,// She thought. //A human who TRULY understands.//\n\n\n\nHe finished speaking. She nodded. \"I will do as you have said,\" She admitted. \"But I have only one question.\"\n\n\n\n\"Ask.\"\n\n\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\n\n\n\"My name is a secret,\" the old man said, \"but most call me The Teacher.\"\n\n\n\n-----\n\nThey left with the dawn: James holding an icepack to his jaw and arguing with the stoic Michel the whole drive home, while Sandra and the Professor listened on in increasingly uncomfortable silence. Sol watched the drive away, then walked into the backyard, where She was sitting and looking out into the forest.\n\n\n\n\"So,\" he asked. \"What did you think of my friends?\"\n\n\n\n\"They seem like decent folk,\" She said. \"But they lack your vision and daring.\"\n\n\n\nSol nodded, and put one hand in his pocket and ran the other along a windowsill. \"You know, last night, after everyone had gone to bed, I went to the bathroom. On my way back to the room, I walked by this window, when I thought I heard someone talking. I heard an interesting conversation. I don't think they realized this window was open the whole time.\"\n\n\n\nShe was silent for a moment. \"You know I didn't mean anything I said,\" She purred. \"I said what I did to draw him out as a traitor. I would never betray you, not after all you've done for me.\" \n\n\n\n\"I hear you,\" Sol sighed. \"But I can't take that chance.\"\n\n\n\nHe shot her twice in the head, saw her fall to the ground dead. He shook his head in regret. \"Pity,\" he whispered. \"I thought you, of all people, would understand.\"\n\n\n\n\"I did,\" a voice whispered, and Sol knew he was dead.\n\n\n\nShe bit his hand off at the wrist first, and it fell to the ground still holding the gun. That part was fast. The rest went much slower. About the time that she tore open his abdomen and started pulling his guts out of his body, he realized he had an erection. \n\n\n\nHis last thought before dying was that this was what he'd wanted all along.\n\n\n\n-----\n\nThe first thing She did was tear down the decorations and burn them in the back yard along with the uneaten portions of his body. She threw the robes onto the fire as well, feeling a sense of vindictive satisfaction as they curled and blackened. Then She walked back into the house and stood in front of the mirror.\n\n\n\nSolomon Kidd looked back at Her. She frowned as She noticed a slight imperfection in the shape of his eyes, then fixed it with a small exertion of will. She would have to practice walking, She realized, in order to get just enough arrogance and braggadocio into all Her movements.\n\n\n\nThen She went upstairs to his office, took the small post-it from the back of his monitor, and used the username and password written there to log on to his account. She spent the rest of the afternoon reading through his emails and correspondence, learning how to become Solomon Kidd.\n\n\n\nIt was shortly after the sun had set that She read one that made Her smile.\n\n\n\n> Re: Stepping Sideways\n\n> From: misskitty@wanderers.net\n\n> To: Sol@freemindnation.net\n\n> \n\n> I'll help you on this, but just this once.

I would like you to come down to the estate and have dinner. I will provide food. You will provide the company.</p>\n<p>Sol</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>She\u2026 no\u2026 Solomon Kidd\u2026 looked at Her\u2026 at his\u2026 reflection in the mirror and smiled. It was amazing how much difference a haircut and a change of clothes made. Not that it had been easy finding a good set of clothes in Sol's closet: the man's tastes ran to colors so eye-searing that Picasso and Warhol would have told him to take things down a notch.</p>\n<p>\"Sol\" took a deep breath and looked around the dining room one more time. Lights low: check. Roses on the table: check. Subtle hints of perfume here and there: check. Low, romantic, violin music: check. Whoever this \"Midnight\" was, she was going to be charmed like she'd never been charmed before.</p>\n<p>She did indulge Herself in one regard: the main dish.</p>\n<p>Based on the emails She'd pulled from Sol's computer, She'd determined a few things about the mysterious Midnight: Midnight was apparently an occultist of some renown, and a hedge mage of some power. Her relationship with Sol was rocky, and involved some philosophical disagreements. She was associated with a Library of some sort: the word was always capitalized. She liked cats.</p>\n<p>\"Sol\" closed \"his\" eyes and tried to form an image in his head of the person he'd soon be meeting: probably young or middle-aged. An intellectual. Attractive? Probably not: he detected no tension there in the past emails. But there was definitely respect. That was an in. That was something he could play off of.</p>\n<p>The doorbell rang, and \"Sol\" started in surprise. He had not sensed any hint of intrusion onto his grounds: the occasional animal, but no humans. Clearly, this Midnight was a much more capable mage than he had anticipated. He straightened his lapels, gave himself one last look in the mirror, then sauntered to the door and threw it open with Sol's practiced flair.</p>\n<p>There was no one there.</p>\n<p>And then \"Sol\" realized he'd made a critical error, as he saw a cat sitting on the doormat. American Shorthair. Black fur. Golden eyes mirroring her own. Small. Sleek-bodied. Seven toes on each foot\u2026 and a rising of the hackles that slowly subsided into a posture of suspicion laced with fear.</p>\n<p>\"So,\" Midnight said. \"Should I say nihao, konichiwa, or anyeung-ha-sae-yo?\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>A few minutes later, they were sitting at either end of the dining room table, staring at each other from across the long expanse of polished mahogany. She had dropped the pretense of Sol's disguise, and had resumed a female form, although she retained Sol's clothing. Midnight was perched on a couple of phone books on the other chair, which She had thoughtfully provided for her.</p>\n<p>Midnight broke the silence by clearing her throat. \"I smell long pork,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"Main dish,\" She replied.</p>\n<p>\"Solomon?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes.\"</p>\n<p>\"Poor kid.\"</p>\n<p>\"He was no longer useful to me, so I made use of him in other ways.\"</p>\n<p>\"And you were going to serve him to me as dinner?\"</p>\n<p>She smiled. \"It amused me.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm sure it did.\"</p>\n<p>A long, drawn out silence. This time, it was She who broke it.</p>\n<p>\"Why did you not run when you realized what I was?\"</p>\n<p>\"What would have been the point? I would have just died tired. Why didn't you kill me when you realized I knew?\"</p>\n<p>\"It would not have served my purpose,\" She said.</p>\n<p>\"So I'm useful to you?\"</p>\n<p>\"For now.\"</p>\n<p>\"Mmm.\"</p>\n<p>The grandfather clock in the main hall rang out the hour.</p>\n<p>Midnight rubbed her forehead with one paw. \"I have a headache,\" she complained. \"I see human but smell fox. Could I ask you to\u2026\"</p>\n<p>There was a crack, like thunder, and the woman at the other end of the table vanished, to be replaced by\u2026 well. It looked like a fox, but a fox out of the nightmares of small rodents everywhere. It was twice the size of your usual fox: almost as large as a dog. It was lean and starved, with a hungry, evil look in its yellow eyes, and nine long tails emerging from its hindquarters. \"Is this better?\" She asked.</p>\n<p>\"Much,\" Midnight said, her voice raspy with fear.</p>\n<p>\"Then let us negotiate,\" She said. \"You know something I want to know. I could try to take it, but such methods are unpleasant and messy. Out of respect for another creature of Myth, I will allow you to ask me for a boon in return for what you know of these\u2026 Ways.\"</p>\n<p>\"The Ways\u2026 I should have known.\" Midnight nodded and relaxed. \"And if I tell you what I know of these Ways\u2026 I have your word on your pride in your own wit that I will leave unharmed?\"</p>\n<p>\"You have it,\" She said.</p>\n<p>\"Then I ask this in payment,\" Midnight said. \"Tell me what Sol was planning\u2026 no. What the Teacher is planning.\"</p>\n<p>\"You know of the Teacher?\" She asked, raising one furry ridged brow questioningly.</p>\n<p>\"I know he's screwed things for all of us,\" Midnight said, real anger seeping into her words. \"Unlike him, the Serpent's Hand doesn't want a war. God's on the side with the biggest guns, and most of us don't even have peashooters. I mean\u2026 I know a kid who can change the color of paint. That's not very much use against bullets.\"</p>\n<p>\"I see,\" She said. \"Then let me tell you of our plans.\"</p>\n<p>She laid them out for Midnight. It took over an hour. By the time it was over, the food had gotten cold, and so had Midnight's heart.</p>\n<p>\"\u2026 it could work,\" the black cat had to admit. \"But the casualties\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"Will be heavy. That's the nature of war. But in the end, we will be victorious.\"</p>\n<p>\"I see,\" Midnight said. She nodded gravely and jumped down from the chair. \"In that case, I suppose I had better show you my end of the bargain.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"I'm just saying that maybe you could stand to relax a bit, Shank,\" Percival said, sipping from his thermos of soup. \"You're always so tense.\"</p>\n<p>\"One o' these days, I'll cut you ta pieces an' pluck those eyes outta yor skull,\" replied the tall, animate scarecrow. It ran a wickedly curved sickle along its \"throat,\" in a slow, smooth gesture. \"Those baby blues'll look good in me stash. Gotta place for 'em right here.\"</p>\n<p>\"You'll have to take 'em first,\" Percival said, resting a hand on the hilt of the massive bastard sword resting against the library table. \"I'll see your ten and raise you thirty any day.\"</p>\n<p>\"If you boys are done with your dickwaving contest, can we please get on with it?\" Ana asked exasperatedly. \"We're going to be here forever.\"</p>\n<p>\"Fine, then, love. Fold,\" said the scarecrow, throwing his cards onto the table.</p>\n<p>\"You FOLD!? All that nonsense about 'raising the stakes,' and you FOLD!?\" Percy complained.</p>\n<p>\"S'called bluffin', mm? Lyin'. Deception. A lil' pecan pie, if ya catch me meanin'.

I know we've had our differences (as all great minds do), but I would appreciate it if you gave me an opportunity to try and smooth things out. I would like you to come down to the estate and have dinner. I will provide food. You will provide the company. \n\n>> \n\n>> Sol\n\n\n\nShe. . . no. . . Solomon Kidd. . . looked at Her. . . at his. . . reflection in the mirror and smiled. It was amazing how much difference a haircut and a change of clothes made. Not that it had been easy finding a good set of clothes in Sol's closet: the man's tastes ran to colors so eye-searing that Picasso and Warhol would have told him to take things down a notch.\n\n\n\n\"Sol\" took a deep breath and looked around the dining room one more time. Lights low: check. Roses on the table: check. Subtle hints of perfume here and there: check. Low, romantic, violin music: check. Whoever this \"Midnight\" was, she was going to be charmed like she'd never been charmed before. \n\n\n\nShe did indulge Herself in one regard: the main dish.\n\n\n\nBased on the emails She'd pulled from Sol's computer, She'd determined a few things about the mysterious Midnight: Midnight was apparently an occultist of some renown, and a hedge mage of some power. Her relationship with Sol was rocky, and involved some philosophical disagreements. She was associated with a Library of some sort: the word was always capitalized. She liked cats.\n\n\n\n\"Sol\" closed \"his\" eyes and tried to form an image in his head of the person he'd soon be meeting: probably young or middle-aged. An intellectual. Attractive? Probably not: he detected no tension there in the past emails. But there was definitely respect. That was an in. That was something he could play off of.\n\n\n\nThe doorbell rang, and \"Sol\" started in surprise. He had not sensed any hint of intrusion onto his grounds: the occasional animal, but no humans. Clearly, this Midnight was a much more capable mage than he had anticipated. He straightened his lapels, gave himself one last look in the mirror, then sauntered to the door and threw it open with Sol's practiced flair.\n\n\n\nThere was no one there.\n\n\n\nAnd then \"Sol\" realized he'd made a critical error, as he saw a cat sitting on the doormat. American Shorthair. Black fur. Golden eyes mirroring her own. Small. Sleek-bodied. Seven toes on each foot. . . and a rising of the hackles that slowly subsided into a posture of suspicion laced with fear.\n\n\n\n\"So,\" Midnight said. \"Should I say nihao, konichiwa, or anyeung-ha-sae-yo?\"\n\n\n\n-----\n\nA few minutes later, they were sitting at either end of the dining room table, staring at each other from across the long expanse of polished mahogany. She had dropped the pretense of Sol's disguise, and had resumed a female form, although she retained Sol's clothing. Midnight was perched on a couple of phone books on the other chair, which She had thoughtfully provided for her.\n\n\n\nMidnight broke the silence by clearing her throat. \"I smell long pork,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\"Main dish,\" She replied.\n\n\n\n\"Solomon?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\n\n\"Poor kid.\" \n\n\n\n\"He was no longer useful to me, so I made use of him in other ways.\"\n\n\n\n\"And you were going to serve him to me as dinner?\"\n\n\n\nShe smiled. \"It amused me.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm sure it did.\"\n\n\n\nA long, drawn out silence. This time, it was She who broke it.\n\n\n\n\"Why did you not run when you realized what I was?\"\n\n\n\n\"What would have been the point? I would have just died tired. Why didn't you kill me when you realized I knew?\"\n\n\n\n\"It would not have served my purpose,\" She said.\n\n\n\n\"So I'm useful to you?\"\n\n\n\n\"For now.\"\n\n\n\n\"Mmm.\"\n\n\n\nThe grandfather clock in the main hall rang out the hour.\n\n\n\nMidnight rubbed her forehead with one paw. \"I have a headache,\" she complained. \"I see human but smell fox. Could I ask you to. . .\"\n\n\n\nThere was a crack, like thunder, and the woman at the other end of the table vanished, to be replaced by. . . well. It looked like a fox, but a fox out of the nightmares of small rodents everywhere. It was twice the size of your usual fox: almost as large as a dog. It was lean and starved, with a hungry, evil look in its yellow eyes, and nine long tails emerging from its hindquarters. \"Is this better?\" She asked.\n\n\n\n\"Much,\" Midnight said, her voice raspy with fear.\n\n\n\n\"Then let us negotiate,\" She said. \"You know something I want to know. I could try to take it, but such methods are unpleasant and messy. Out of respect for another creature of Myth, I will allow you to ask me for a boon in return for what you know of these. . . Ways.\"\n\n\n\n\"The Ways. . . I should have known.\" Midnight nodded and relaxed. \"And if I tell you what I know of these Ways. . . I have your word on your pride in your own wit that I will leave unharmed?\"\n\n\n\n\"You have it,\" She said.\n\n\n\n\"Then I ask this in payment,\" Midnight said. \"Tell me what Sol was planning. . . no. What the Teacher is planning.\"\n\n\n\n\"You know of the Teacher?\" She asked, raising one furry ridged brow questioningly.\n\n\n\n\"I know he's screwed things for all of us,\" Midnight said, real anger seeping into her words. \"Unlike him, the Serpent's Hand doesn't want a war. God's on the side with the biggest guns, and most of us don't even have peashooters. I mean. . . I know a kid who can change the color of paint. That's not very much use against bullets.\"\n\n\n\n\"I see,\" She said. \"Then let me tell you of our plans.\"\n\n\n\nShe laid them out for Midnight. It took over an hour. By the time it was over, the food had gotten cold, and so had Midnight's heart.\n\n\n\n\". . . it could work,\" the black cat had to admit. \"But the casualties. . .\"\n\n\n\n\"Will be heavy. That's the nature of war. But in the end, we will be victorious.\"\n\n\n\n\"I see,\" Midnight said. She nodded gravely and jumped down from the chair. \"In that case, I suppose I had better show you my end of the bargain.\"\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\"I'm just saying that maybe you could stand to relax a bit, Shank,\" Percival said, sipping from his thermos of soup. \"You're always so tense.\"\n\n\n\n\"One o' these days, I'll cut you ta pieces an' pluck those eyes outta yor skull,\" replied the tall, animate scarecrow. It ran a wickedly curved sickle along its \"throat,\" in a slow, smooth gesture. \"Those baby blues'll look good in me stash. Gotta place for 'em right here.\"\n\n\n\n\"You'll have to take 'em first,\" Percival said, resting a hand on the hilt of the massive bastard sword resting against the library table. \"I'll see your ten and raise you thirty any day.\"\n\n\n\n\"If you boys are done with your dickwaving contest, can we please get on with it?\" Ana asked exasperatedly. \"We're going to be here forever.\"\n\n\n\n\"Fine, then, love. Fold,\" said the scarecrow, throwing his cards onto the table.\n\n\n\n\"You FOLD!? All that nonsense about 'raising the stakes,' and you FOLD!?\" Percy complained.\n\n\n\n\"S'called bluffin', mm? Lyin'. Deception. A lil' pecan pie, if ya catch me meanin'. Somethin' a ponce like you wouldn't get.\"\n\n\n\n\"Fine, Chainshank folds,\" Ana interjected, interrupting the brewing argument. \"Azi?\"\n\n\n\nThe filthy little boy looked up and grinned happily. \"Lookit my pictures!\" he said. \"I fixed this man!\" He displayed the Jack of Hearts, now beautifully rendered in oil paints on the thin pasteboard stock.\n\n\n\n\". . . and Azi has decided to draw all over his cards. Fantastic. This is wonderful. You guys are awesome,\" Ana Hita sighed. She threw her hand of cards into the center of the table and got up. \"I'm going home.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well,\" Percy sighed. \"That was a bit of a wash. What do we do now?\"\n\n\n\n\"Ya tired already? Need a nice rest, mm? 'M good at helpin people sleep.\" Chainshank sneers.\n\n\n\n\"How about no. How's it going, Meimei?\" Percy asked.\n\n\n\nA yeti-woman covered in reddish-brown fur looked up from her book and nodded. \"It goes well.\"\n\n\n\n\"Whatcha got there?\"\n\n\n\n\"The autobiography of Bruce Lee. His insights are fascinating.\"\n\n\n\n\"You keep on with that, lil' sis,\" Percy said.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Azi had crawled under a nearby table and was chewing on the bloody leg of some unidentifiable horrible something that he'd killed earlier. There was a sound of snapping bone and crunching marrow.\n\n\n\nPercy looked down from the balcony and raised an eyebrow. \"Well,\" he said, \"That's interesting.\"\n\n\n\n\"Whazzat?\" Chainshank asked.\n\n\n\n\"Miss Kitty is here,\" Percy said. \"And she brought a. . . friend. . .\"\n\n\n\nPercy's voice trailed off, and he rubbed the back of his neck. Chainshank frowned, his pumpkin head's spirit glow dimming suspiciously. \"Spider sense tingling, mm?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah,\" Percy said. \"Definitely tingling.\"\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\"That young man is watching me,\" She said. \"I don't like that.\"\n\n\n\n\"He's a paladin,\" Midnight said. \"Lives in a homeless shelter. Claims to talk to God.\"\n\n\n\n\"To God?\"\n\n\n\n\"He seems to think so. Are you scared?\" Midnight asked.\n\n\n\n\"Certainly not. I have nothing to fear from a child like that. I can have his guts out in an instant, if I liked.\"\n\n\n\nCurrently, She had chosen a new form: that of a young woman with large, horn-rimmed glasses, dressed in a motley array of coats and scarves. She had a large purse over one shoulder, and exuded a look of dismay mixed with confusion. The body was that of a graduate student in occult studies, long dead, who had tried to find Her lair in one of Her brief moments of freedom before being recaptured by the Foundation. She licked her lips at the memory of that hunt, of the taste of fear She had savored on that cold night. The scent of prey in this place was nearly overwhelming.\n\n\n\nMidnight shook her head. \"I wouldn't if I were you. The guardians here don't like violence.\"\n\n\n\n\"I am not afraid of any guardians.\"\n\n\n\n\"You should be. They have a manticore. They caught it themselves.\"\n\n\n\nShe looked around the room and nodded. \"A perfect prison. I understand why you brought me here first,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\"I don't think you do understand,\" Midnight said. \"If I wanted to get rid of you, I would have just sent you somewhere where you could never come back from. Say, the End of Time and Space, or the heart of a newborn star.\"\n\n\n\n\"You see,\" the black cat continued, \"this place is more than just a safe haven. It's also a repository of knowledge.

That's why we call it the Wanderer's Library.\" She looked up at the fox with an expression of grim satisfaction on her face. \"If you can't see the potential in a Library with every book that's ever been written, that serves as a neutral ground for everyone, and that you can use to go to and from literally anywhere in the world, you might as well go back to the Jailers.\"\n\n\n\nMidnight saw from the expression on Her face that She did understand. \"Let me tell you about the rules here,\" Midnight said. \"Don't steal the books.

After the Tempest Night, everyone had been terrified that that hybrid of the Lizard and the wire weed would start killing everyone with exploding monitors or crushing them in blast doors or something, but what happened was possibly worse.\n<p>It spoke to them.</p>\n<p>It had assumed control of the PA system pretty quickly, and started using it almost immediately; endless streams of hatred and promises of gore and threats of unimaginably painful death\u2026 It poured from every intercom, every speaker, every monitor on the site. At first, the higher-ups had forbidden anyone from coming within 10 feet of any of the PA speakers, but after a couple of weeks without significant incident, people started getting lax. They were still relying on their laptops or smartphones, true, but they'd relaxed a bit and started using the mainframe and some of the desktops. If nothing else, they needed to get the data copied off it to another site.</p>\n<p>But still, that voice. It never stopped. Sometimes it was a roar, deafening in its vitriol, blasting through his skull like a shotgun blast. Other times it was soft, right on the edge of hearing, just insistent enough that part of his brain strained to hear it, like a leaky faucet on a quiet night. Yet other times it was a high-pitched hate speech, whirring like a dental drill right through his ears. He couldn't get used to it; its lack of pattern or reason just drove him up the wall, always keeping him tense and on edge trying and failing to predict the next words. It was a relief when he went to the temporary barracks just outside the site. He would collapse into his cot, feeling blessed by the still, <em>natural</em> sounds that surrounded the tent.</p>\n<p>He was feeling especially tense that day, having spent the last 10 hours poring over lines and lines of meaningless-to-him data, trying to ferret out any data corruption before transferring it to his laptop. His eyes ached, his ears rang, his shoulders tensed tighter and tighter until he finally couldn't take it anymore and decided to go catch some shut-eye before he went crazy. He walked at a fast clip towards the stairwell up (even in a relaxed environment, no-one trusted the elevators), eager to escape the nerve-grinding noise.</p>\n<p>He was almost at the stairwell door when he noticed the rope of cable extending across the floor in front of him. It didn't appear terribly unusual, except that the floor under it was smouldering and pitted. He didn't think that the Old Man was hunting this far up the site, but he wasn't <em>sure</em> and didn't trust that sign of rot and unusual decay.</p>\n<p>The cable suddenly started undulating and several wires shot upwards from it, slamming into the walls and ceiling, crisscrossing and forming a steadily advancing web of wires. He turned and ran, hoping to get to some place of relative safety. He could hear it screeching behind him as the wires sprouted and entwined, an electronic whine that somehow came together with the grumbling of the wall-mounted alarms, forming words:</p>\n<p>\"Run, foul thing.

After the Tempest Night, everyone had been terrified that that hybrid of the Lizard and the wire weed would start killing everyone with exploding monitors or crushing them in blast doors or something, but what happened was possibly worse.\n\n\n\nIt spoke to them.\n\n\n\nIt had assumed control of the PA system pretty quickly, and started using it almost immediately; endless streams of hatred and promises of gore and threats of unimaginably painful death... It poured from every intercom, every speaker, every monitor on the site. At first, the higher-ups had forbidden anyone from coming within 10 feet of any of the PA speakers, but after a couple of weeks without significant incident, people started getting lax. They were still relying on their laptops or smartphones, true, but they'd relaxed a bit and started using the mainframe and some of the desktops. If nothing else, they needed to get the data copied off it to another site.\n\n\n\nBut still, that voice. It never stopped. Sometimes it was a roar, deafening in its vitriol, blasting through his skull like a shotgun blast. Other times it was soft, right on the edge of hearing, just insistent enough that part of his brain strained to hear it, like a leaky faucet on a quiet night. Yet other times it was a high-pitched hate speech, whirring like a dental drill right through his ears. He couldn't get used to it; its lack of pattern or reason just drove him up the wall, always keeping him tense and on edge trying and failing to predict the next words. It was a relief when he went to the temporary barracks just outside the site. He would collapse into his cot, feeling blessed by the still, //natural// sounds that surrounded the tent.\n\n\n\nHe was feeling especially tense that day, having spent the last 10 hours poring over lines and lines of meaningless-to-him data, trying to ferret out any data corruption before transferring it to his laptop. His eyes ached, his ears rang, his shoulders tensed tighter and tighter until he finally couldn't take it anymore and decided to go catch some shut-eye before he went crazy. He walked at a fast clip towards the stairwell up (even in a relaxed environment, no-one trusted the elevators), eager to escape the nerve-grinding noise.\n\n\n\nHe was almost at the stairwell door when he noticed the rope of cable extending across the floor in front of him. It didn't appear terribly unusual, except that the floor under it was smouldering and pitted. He didn't think that the Old Man was hunting this far up the site, but he wasn't //sure// and didn't trust that sign of rot and unusual decay.\n\n\n\nThe cable suddenly started undulating and several wires shot upwards from it, slamming into the walls and ceiling, crisscrossing and forming a steadily advancing web of wires. He turned and ran, hoping to get to some place of relative safety. He could hear it screeching behind him as the wires sprouted and entwined, an electronic whine that somehow came together with the grumbling of the wall-mounted alarms, forming words:\n\n\n\n\"Run, foul thing. Disgusting mass of flesh and breath, run and run and die.\"\n\n\n\nAnd he did. He ran as fast as he could, for what terror and adrenaline made seem like hours. Every time he slowed as he lost his breath, he would see more cables break out of the walls to hit the ceiling above him or the floor beside him, spraying a noxious, caustic fluid that burned through his clothes and into the flesh of his head and arms and pumping thighs. He felt the electric sting of wires as they slashed like whips at his legs and back, every shock forcing him harder and faster ahead of the death chasing him.\n\n\n\nHis vision narrowed to a thin tunnel ahead of him as he stumbled again and again, somehow staying just barely ahead of the web behind him.

December had been and gone and February was letting out a slow death rattle in the form of gale-force winds. I wore my hair short which meant is wasn\u2019t snatched this way and that like most of the people I had passed today but my earring had had to be removed before the wind did the job for me.<br/>\nSomebody said to me once that it\u2019s only ever windy or cold; never both. This friend of mine had never been to the city however, so I let them keep believing it.<br/>\nThe wind would have given me a good excuse to stay inside but when I\u2019ve a job to do I try my best to see it through as soon as possible.<br/>\nGet it out the way, so to speak.<br/>\nThat in mind I had been staring at the front of the pub for quite some time.<br/>\nIt was more a reluctance to go inside than to do the job \u2013 I\u2019d made all the effort to be warm outside that I\u2019d be boiled like a lobster the moment I went inside. That was the problem with this city; you could only be too hot or too cold.<br/>\nThe pub itself was in a very good condition compared to the buildings that surrounded it. When you serve the locals around here you were bound to make quite a lot of money. It was painted mainly in reds, though the window sills were matte black as was the sign above the door. <em>The Splayed Drifter</em> it was called and in my mind it was only named that so you\u2019d never forget it. I could hear the sounds of subdued Sunday carousal inside but the thought of other people was never a tempting one. But I knew I\u2019d have to go in eventually or my client would leave. So I braced myself and pushed my way inside.</p>\n<p>There was a football match on the corner set. Funny, it was one of those old-fashioned televisions you\u2019re always surprised to find still existing. Considering how well the place was doing for itself I would have expected at least a flat screen but then maybe that was the attraction, that sense of nostalgia. Most of the regulars were well past their sell-by date and sitting here pretending it was the good old days was often the only barrier between them and a quiet, miserable end to life. I didn\u2019t raise a comment when I entered and no awkward silence descended. I wasn\u2019t the only non-regular after all and I was barely noteworthy material in the first place. Apart from my eyes of course but that goes without saying really.</p>\n<p>Not seeing my client straight away I sat down at the bar.<br/>\nA woman in her forties came over to me as soon as she was finished chatting with one of the other patrons and pulled a pint glass down, before looking to me with a smile.<br/>\n\u201cWhat\u2019ll you be having, dear?\u201d she asked.<br/>\n\u201cCoffee, please. Black three sugars.\u201d<br/>\n\u201cBeer?\u201d<br/>\n\u201cNo thank you.\u201d<br/>\n\u201cEverybody wants beer.\u201d I sighed.<br/>\n\u201cNot me. These days absinthe is all I really touch. Or the coffee I just asked for.\u201d<br/>\n\u201cEverybody wants beer.\u201d<br/>\nI looked her in the eyes and she froze up a little. She quite clearly wanted to look away but true to form she just couldn\u2019t. I\u2019ve never been able to explain the phenomenon other than the guess that my gaze is just as fucked-up strange as I am.<br/>\n\u201cCoffee. Black. Three Sugars. Please.\u201d I said as gently as I could.<br/>\nShe nodded and I looked away. Relieved, the woman walked off to the machine.<br/>\nI relaxed and looked around the room, trying to pick my client out from the crowd.</p>\n<p>It was easy enough to be honest. All I needed to look for was those green stains we can\u2019t help but leave behind us. Normal folks don\u2019t and I don\u2019t, but the ladies and gentlemen moving in my circles had no choice. You have to be out of the ordinary to see it but the stains are often everywhere. Faint and pale usually but always prevalent.<br/>\nSure enough there was a man sat with a small group of others, telling a story. They crowded around him looks of mirth on their faces and raucous laughter filled the place as he reached a punchline.<br/>\nHe briefly looked up and I beckoned him over. He double-took and his face went rapidly to concern but he masked that almost as soon as it showed. He made some excuses and headed up to the bar, a rough type clapping him heartily on the back as he went.<br/>\nHe got to the seat next to me about the time my coffee arrived. He pushed a note into the bar woman\u2019s hand and she thanked him before walking off to serve others.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you\u2026?\u201d<br/>\nI took a sip of my coffee. Burnt, damn it.<br/>\n\u201cNo.\u201d I replied. \u201cI called you over so I could knock you out and steal your kidneys. The hell do you think, Seamus?\u201d<br/>\nHe gulped and his face flushed a little. He didn\u2019t say a word for a moment or two before it hit him.<br/>\n\u201cI never told you my\u2026\u201d<br/>\n\u201cNot the only thing I\u2019m not supposed to know. It\u2019s the circles you move in now.\u201d<br/>\nActually I had just run a background check on his picture but the new kids on the block were always easy to play with. They didn\u2019t understand that having some contacts with the police and knowing a decent hacker did more than mystic tomes and summoning abominations ever could.<br/>\n\u201cSo Seamus.\u201d I said taking another sip. \u201cWhat is it you\u2019re paying me for?\u201d<br/>\n\u201cI, uh\u2026 kinda let something happen.\u201d<br/>\n\u201cSo does everyone. Be blunt.\u201d<br/>\n\u201c\u2026I think it\u2019s like a ghost or something. It\u2019s in my house.\u201d<br/>\nI sucked my teeth.<br/>\n\u201cWell that\u2019s certainly a downer for you I\u2019d imagine.\u201d<br/>\n\u201cSomeone told me you\u2026 do things about it.\u201d<br/>\n\u201cDid they tell you my price?\u201d<br/>\n\u201cI guess so.\u201d<br/>\nGood enough.<br/>\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re willing to pay?\u201d<br/>\n\u201cI can up front if you like.\u201d<br/>\nHe reached into his pocket and brought his wallet back out, tugging at the zip on the side. I brushed his hand away and shook my head.<br/>\n\u201cNo. Leave it until the job\u2019s done.\u201d<br/>\nHe put it back in his pocket, confused.<br/>\nNow for the important question.<br/>\n\u201cSeamus, how much do you know?\u201d<br/>\n\u201cWhat\u2026 what do you mean? The ghost-thing acts kinda like-\u201c<br/>\n\u201cNo, no, no, no, no. Not what I meant at all. How much do you <em>know?</em> And how long have you known?\u201d<br/>\nHe thought about it.<br/>\nI waited and finished my coffee as he thought.<br/>\n\u201cNot much. I think I first found stuff out last year. The first lot I met tried talking me out of it all.\u201d<br/>\nThat was all I needed.<br/>\nI thanked him and bought him a drink. No need to ask directions, I already knew the place.<br/>\nAnyway, I had some preparation to do first.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>All the lights in Seamus\u2019 house were properly fucked.<br/>\nI flicked every switch I came across and nothing. I had a maglite so it wasn\u2019t an enormous problem but it would have been a lot nicer.<br/>\nThe place was dusty; he hadn\u2019t been here for a week or more at a guess. Cluttered too. Seamus clearly did not concern himself with tidying up very often.<br/>\nOther than that it was pretty clear that he had a good amount of money. Top of the range electronics \u2013 dead as the lights if you were wondering \u2013 rich carpets on most of the floors, an especially fancy bathroom and even a large collection of antique books.<br/>\nI groaned. It was always sodding books. You never found somebody who\u2019d pulled back The Curtain via a skiing accident say, or by dancing unknowingly an ancient summoning dance or something. No, people always had to find some tome not meant for mortal eyes blah, blah sodding blah and then next thing you know I\u2019m breaking into some idiot\u2019s house to see why he disappeared after screaming to his family about the tentacles.<br/>\nIt was just so damn clich\u00e9.<br/>\nBut ours not to reason why and all that. I\u2019d have checked the books out but in all honesty I couldn\u2019t care less about them and I had better things to do.</p>\n<p>Like figure out where the dead-thing was watching me from.<br/>\nI\u2019d felt the eyes on me from the moment I opened the door but so far nothing. Some of the stains in the house were so dark green they may as well be black so it had definitely been hanging around. It had dropped the temperature a few degrees after I\u2019d checked the bathroom but I think that was more because of how long I\u2019d been here rather than where I\u2019d explored.<br/>\nI hate it when you know that something is watching you but you can\u2019t see it. If there was ever a better way to unnerve someone it clearly fell out of fashion some time ago. And this dead-thing was a patient one in all likelihood. In most cases they had to be.<br/>\nI remember this case from a few years back, not one of mine you understand. This family felt they were being haunted and called in all manner of people to check it out. Vicars, \u201cghost speakers\u201d, witch doctors and exorcists passed through the place like a tourist destination. It was quite a sensational case because whatever was haunting them was clearly malevolent. <em>Get out</em> scratched on the walls and scars on the children, you know the stuff. But whenever a quote-unquote professional took a look there was nothing to see. Proof of the activities was everywhere but there weren\u2019t any activities at all when people other than the family paid attention.<br/>\nSo eventually the media lost interest. People stopped discussing it by water coolers. And one by one the family were picked off and eaten alive in the space of a day and a half.</p>\n<p>Because that\u2019s how dead-things operate. They let you know they\u2019re going to get you but they never do until you stop expecting it. They\u2019re not even playful, it\u2019s just part of the mentality.<br/>\nIf I recall correctly the police broke into the place a few weeks later and found what was left of the bodies stitched together and rotting on the family sofa, television remote clutched in one half-eaten hand.<br/>\nThey pinned it on a serial killer thankfully. I have no idea how hard the local Guardian worked to achieve that piece of magic but they have my eternal respect.</p>\n<p>Finally something happened \u2013 a cup flew from the kitchen table and shattered against the wall. A fleck of crockery stung my cheek and I turned smiling. Obviously there was nothing there but it was or had just been in this room. I saw a flicker. I started to whistle and pretended that I hadn\u2019t. These things work easier if the target underestimates you.<br/>\nI wandered nonchalantly through the kitchen into the large front room. The door on the cupboard the television was sat on was hanging from its hinges. It was covered in green stains that hadn\u2019t been there last time I was in the room.<br/>\nI reached into my coat and pulled out an old-fashioned yo-yo. I can\u2019t remember the last time I saw anybody else with one, I think they stopped being popular not long after I was born. But they were excellent for making one look innocent. They also made good garrotte wires in a pinch given you have the right string. Don\u2019t ask me how I know.<br/>\nI carried on acting uninterested and stupid as I wandered through the house playing with my yo-yo. I still looked like I was looking for a ghost but I was looking the same way a presenter from some god-awful \u201cdocumentary\u201d on the paranormal would.<br/>\nI had a notion that it was now in the bathroom. I climbed the stairs and made my way there. It had decided to reveal itself, I think.<br/>\nThere\u2019s always the game before the catch, a compulsion we\u2019ve already discussed. But this one could probably smell that I was different. And that was what made me attractive.<br/>\nBut I\u2019d be ready. My plan was simple \u2013 I\u2019d walk in and when it manifested I\u2019d thwack it with the yo-yo.<br/>\nThat was the big secret about dead-things; they\u2019re completely corporeal. Sure they\u2019re the basis for ghosts but the myriad reasons for that is a subject I could probably write a book on if I ever found the time.<br/>\nI walked in and there was bloody writing on the mirror, of course.<br/>\n<em>You should not be here</em>. How original.</p>\n<p>I felt a cold sensation behind me. A sort of hissing noise too, not so you\u2019d notice if you weren\u2019t expecting it.<br/>\nLazily, I turned. And my mouth dropped.<br/>\nBefore me stood a gaunt figure. It was partially covered in chitin and it rubbed two long hands together in a beetle-like fashion. Its eyes were plentiful and should have been on its head rather than torso but we\u2019re not all perfect. It had no face. A mouth, eyes on the torso but the head was essentially a blank dome. Blood dripped from a gaping wound on its side and there were more eyes on the inside of the gash.<br/>\nIt wasn\u2019t supposed to look like that.<br/>\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a dead-thing.\u201d I said.<br/>\n\u201c<strong>Very astute.</strong>\u201d It smiled.<br/>\nThen I was asleep and I couldn\u2019t tell you why.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>I was bound to a chair in the kitchen when I opened my eyes.<br/>\nSeamus was there and so was the monster, they were stood side by side. Seamus looked almost reluctant but there was a hunger in his features too.<br/>\nHe had a melon-baller dangling loosely from one hand. He looked to the creature and it nodded. He walked over to me and its eyes span and followed him.<br/>\n\u201cI lied at the pub.\u201d He said, almost apologetically.<br/>\n\u201cYou certainly did.\u201d<br/>\n\u201cI\u2026 we needed you.\u201d<br/>\nThat was confusing.<br/>\n\u201cWhy me? Anyone you\u2019ve ever met will tell you I\u2019m nothing special.\u201d<br/>\nHe motioned to his face, and tried to think of the right words.<br/>\n\u201cYou\u2026 perceive. Things we can\u2019t. We tried for months and nothing let us. You see things that most others don\u2019t, too. No, other people like us.\u201d He said before I could speak.<br/>\n\u201cWell that\u2019s news to me, Seamus. I think your friend over there\u2019s been talking shit.\u201d<br/>\n\u201c<strong>Nobody tells you that you make no sense.</strong>\u201d It said.<br/>\n\u201c<strong>On the times you converse with others, you discuss the things you\u2019ve seen and people raise not a question. Have their faces never given it away? You are a rare thing, Seeker. One that sees all that there is.</strong>\u201d<br/>\n\u201cThat sounds totally idiotic. Believe me, if that was true I <em>would</em> notice.\" I said, but I started thinking about it. The first time I\u2019d encountered a corpse-thing I told a gentleman who I\u2019d known for a long while about the whole thing. He had raised his eyebrows at my description of it in a way that should have implied to me that he didn\u2019t know that they looked like that. That wasn\u2019t proof of course but I hadn\u2019t got where I was today by not believing things.<br/>\nThat in mind I <em>had</em> got where I was today by fucking up a simple investigation.<br/>\nSeamus looked at the monster then back to me. He dropped to my level, his face an inch from mine.<br/>\n\u201cWe have to take your eyes. I\u2019m sorry but we have to.\u201d<br/>\nHe kissed my forehead and my lips. I only hated him slightly more.<br/>\n\u201cI am really sorry.\u201d<br/>\nMy eyes flickered to the kitchen table. My yo-yo lay on it.<br/>\n\u201cYou do seem to be sorry.\u201d I said \u201cBut in a moment you\u2019ll be even sorrier.\u201d<br/>\n\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He said and started digging the melon baller into my socket.</p>\n<p>I screamed. Pain shot through my skull as the jagged teeth around the cup bit through flesh. I don\u2019t know how he was planning to sever the optic nerve but he\u2019d persist until it was done. Everything went red on my right side. I screamed until I was hoarse.<br/>\nThe yo-yo was still there.<br/>\nI put up a little struggle as he worked my eye free and waited for the monster to make its move. It was smiling so eagerly. It sniffed at the air and savoured the scent of my blood. And eventually it moved closer to get a better look.<br/>\nWith a wet pop my eye came loose from the socket. Seamus stood back a little and looked at his work. The creature closed in, it\u2019s clawed hands raised.</p>\n<p>I spat a word that I shouldn\u2019t have been able to pronounce, and couldn\u2019t without the pain to guide my lips.<br/>\nThe yo-yo on the table burst in a flash of blinding dark.</p>\n<p>There was a rending sound and maybe some screams.<br/>\nMy face was very wet.<br/>\nOnce I could see again there wasn\u2019t much left of the creature. Seamus lay on the floor, panting heavily and looking with shock at his arm. Well, where his arm should have been.<br/>\nI shrugged off the ropes which had been frayed to pieces.<br/>\nI crouched by Seamus, ignoring the pain from my eye.<br/>\n\u201cCheckmate my friend.\u201d I said.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>I held Seamus by the scruff of the neck and he stared at the door.<br/>\nIt was an unimpressive one. A flat dull piece of wood with an off-grey handle. But he knew that it held importance.<br/>\nSo did I, for that matter.<br/>\nMy eye was gone. I\u2019d had to cut it off myself, pieces of the monster (which I still didn\u2019t recognise) had clung to it and bubbles that shouldn\u2019t have appeared did. If I didn\u2019t lose the eye then I may have lost my brain, or become a slave or another one of the monsters. You never know.<br/>\nThe patch was good enough for now but if I wanted to keep appearances up I would have to get some mirrored glasses.<br/>\n\u201cHere we go.\u201d I told Seamus after a moment.<br/>\nSilence, silence for a good few minutes before he replied.<br/>\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want this.\u201d<br/>\n\u201cNobody wants this. I don\u2019t want this.\u201d<br/>\n\u201cThen let me leave!\u201d He cried, trying to turn to look at me.<br/>\n\u201cWhat would you have done to me after it took my eyes, Seamus?\u201d<br/>\nHis shoulders sagged.<br/>\n\u201cI think I should correct myself in that case. I <em>usually</em> don\u2019t want this.\u201d<br/>\nHe stopped speaking again. I pulled him aside and put my hand on the door.<br/>\n\u201cMay I ask something?\u201d he said.<br/>\n\u201cYou just did.\u201d<br/>\nHe looked at me. I rolled my eye.<br/>\n\u201cOne thing.\u201d<br/>\n\u201cIf\u2026\u201d he licked his lips nervously. \u201cIf it had just been a ghost. Would you still be doing\u2026 this?\u201d<br/>\nI looked at the door.<br/>\n\u201cYes.\u201d I said.<br/>\nHis face fell.<br/>\n\u201cHey. You asked.\u201d I pulled the door open.<br/>\n\u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s been a pleasure, but\u2026\u201d<br/>\nI threw him in and closed the door. I held my hands to my ears but the screams were so loud.<br/>\nAfter they stopped I opened the door and went in myself.</p>\n<p>The Unknowable Thing loomed over me, a half-digested and catatonic Seamus lay below It.<br/>\n\u201cHere we are. One scumbag supreme. And the monster fucker is gone too.\u201d<br/>\nIt questioned me.<br/>\n\u201cBlown to bits. Not coming back. As specified.\u201d<br/>\nIt was satisfied.<br/>\nI looked around, almost looked up at It but remembered what happened the last time I looked at It directly.<br/>\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me why they wanted me.\u201d<br/>\nThe Unknowable Thing asked a question.<br/>\n\u201cHell yes it was important! The only reason I survived is because of that bloody toy! What if I hadn\u2019t brought it along, huh? Then where\u2019d you be?\u201d<br/>\nIt commented.<br/>\nI raised a finger.<br/>\n\u201cBullshit. If I was that dispensable I wouldn\u2019t be standing here. You\u2019d have found someone else.\u201d<br/>\nThe Unknowable Thing conceded.<br/>\nI\u2019d already had enough. Talking to the Unknowable Thing always drains you.<br/>\nI turned to leave and It let me. I was at the door before I turned and asked a question.<br/>\n\u201cIs it true? What the monster said about me?\u201d<br/>\nIt answered.<br/>\nI nodded and stepped out the door and up the cellar steps.</p>\n<p>God but I needed a drink. As always.</p>\n<p>But that\u2019s just how it is in my line of work.</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/housework\">Housework</a>\" by Fykos, from the <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

December had been and gone and February was letting out a slow death rattle in the form of gale-force winds. I wore my hair short which meant is wasn\u2019t snatched this way and that like most of the people I had passed today but my earring had had to be removed before the wind did the job for me.\n\nSomebody said to me once that it\u2019s only ever windy or cold; never both. This friend of mine had never been to the city however, so I let them keep believing it.\n\nThe wind would have given me a good excuse to stay inside but when I\u2019ve a job to do I try my best to see it through as soon as possible.\n\nGet it out the way, so to speak.\n\nThat in mind I had been staring at the front of the pub for quite some time.\n\nIt was more a reluctance to go inside than to do the job \u2013 I\u2019d made all the effort to be warm outside that I\u2019d be boiled like a lobster the moment I went inside. That was the problem with this city; you could only be too hot or too cold.\n\nThe pub itself was in a very good condition compared to the buildings that surrounded it. When you serve the locals around here you were bound to make quite a lot of money. It was painted mainly in reds, though the window sills were matte black as was the sign above the door.\u00a0\u00a0//The Splayed Drifter// it was called and in my mind it was only named that so you\u2019d never forget it. I could hear the sounds of subdued Sunday carousal inside but the thought of other people was never a tempting one. But I knew I\u2019d have to go in eventually or my client would leave. So I braced myself and pushed my way inside.\n\n\n\nThere was a football match on the corner set. Funny, it was one of those old-fashioned televisions you\u2019re always surprised to find still existing. Considering how well the place was doing for itself I would have expected at least a flat screen but then maybe that was the attraction, that sense of nostalgia. Most of the regulars were well past their sell-by date and sitting here pretending it was the good old days was often the only barrier between them and a quiet, miserable end to life. I didn\u2019t raise a comment when I entered and no awkward silence descended. I wasn\u2019t the only non-regular after all and I was barely noteworthy material in the first place. Apart from my eyes of course but that goes without saying really.\n\n\n\nNot seeing my client straight away I sat down at the bar.\n\nA woman in her forties came over to me as soon as she was finished chatting with one of the other patrons and pulled a pint glass down, before looking to me with a smile.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019ll you be having, dear?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cCoffee, please. Black three sugars.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeer?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo thank you.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody wants beer.\u201d I sighed.\n\n\u201cNot me. These days absinthe is all I really touch. Or the coffee I just asked for.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody wants beer.\u201d\n\nI looked her in the eyes and she froze up a little. She quite clearly wanted to look away but true to form she just couldn\u2019t. I\u2019ve never been able to explain the phenomenon other than the guess that my gaze is just as fucked-up strange as I am.\n\n\u201cCoffee. Black. Three Sugars. Please.\u201d I said as gently as I could.\n\nShe nodded and I looked away. Relieved, the woman walked off to the machine.\n\nI relaxed and looked around the room, trying to pick my client out from the crowd.\n\n\n\nIt was easy enough to be honest. All I needed to look for was those green stains we can\u2019t help but leave behind us. Normal folks don\u2019t and I don\u2019t, but the ladies and gentlemen moving in my circles had no choice. You have to be out of the ordinary to see it but the stains are often everywhere. Faint and pale usually but always prevalent.\n\nSure enough there was a man sat with a small group of others, telling a story. They crowded around him looks of mirth on their faces and raucous laughter filled the place as he reached a punchline.\n\nHe briefly looked up and I beckoned him over. He double-took and his face went rapidly to concern but he masked that almost as soon as it showed. He made some excuses and headed up to the bar, a rough type clapping him heartily on the back as he went.\n\nHe got to the seat next to me about the time my coffee arrived.\u00a0\u00a0He pushed a note into the bar woman\u2019s hand and she thanked him before walking off to serve others.\n\n\n\n\u201cAre you\u2026?\u201d\n\nI took a sip of my coffee. Burnt, damn it.\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d I replied. \u201cI called you over so I could knock you out and steal your kidneys. The hell do you think, Seamus?\u201d\n\nHe gulped and his face flushed a little. He didn\u2019t say a word for a moment or two before it hit him.\n\n\u201cI never told you my\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cNot the only thing I\u2019m not supposed to know. It\u2019s the circles you move in now.\u201d\n\nActually I had just run a background check on his picture but the new kids on the block were always easy to play with. They didn\u2019t understand that having some contacts with the police and knowing a decent hacker did more than mystic tomes and summoning abominations ever could.\n\n\u201cSo Seamus.\u201d I said taking another sip. \u201cWhat is it you\u2019re paying me for?\u201d\n\n\u201cI, uh\u2026 kinda let something happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo does everyone. Be blunt.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026I think it\u2019s like a ghost or something. It\u2019s in my house.\u201d\n\nI sucked my teeth.\n\n\u201cWell that\u2019s certainly a downer for you I\u2019d imagine.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone told me you\u2026 do things about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid they tell you my price?\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess so.\u201d\n\nGood enough.\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re willing to pay?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can up front if you like.\u201d\n\nHe reached into his pocket and brought his wallet back out, tugging at the zip on the side. I brushed his hand away and shook my head.\n\n\u201cNo. Leave it until the job\u2019s done.\u201d\n\nHe put it back in his pocket, confused.\n\nNow for the important question.\n\n\u201cSeamus, how much do you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2026 what do you mean? The ghost-thing acts kinda like-\u201c\n\n\u201cNo, no, no, no, no. Not what I meant at all. How much do you //know?// And how long have you known?\u201d\n\nHe thought about it.\n\nI waited and finished my coffee as he thought.\n\n\u201cNot much. I think I first found stuff out last year. The first lot I met tried talking me out of it all.\u201d\n\nThat was all I needed.\n\nI thanked him and bought him a drink. No need to ask directions, I already knew the place.\n\nAnyway, I had some preparation to do first.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nAll the lights in Seamus\u2019 house were properly fucked.\n\nI flicked every switch I came across and nothing. I had a maglite so it wasn\u2019t an enormous problem but it would have been a lot nicer.\n\nThe place was dusty; he hadn\u2019t been here for a week or more at a guess. Cluttered too. Seamus clearly did not concern himself with tidying up very often.\n\nOther than that it was pretty clear that he had a good amount of money. Top of the range electronics \u2013 dead as the lights if you were wondering \u2013 rich carpets on most of the floors, an especially fancy bathroom and even a large collection of antique books.\n\nI groaned. It was always sodding books. You never found somebody who\u2019d pulled back The\u00a0\u00a0Curtain via a skiing accident say, or by dancing unknowingly an ancient summoning dance or something. No, people always had to find some tome not meant for mortal eyes blah, blah sodding blah and then next thing you know I\u2019m breaking into some idiot\u2019s house to see why he disappeared after screaming to his family about the tentacles.\n\nIt was just so damn clich\u00e9.\n\nBut ours not to reason why and all that. I\u2019d have checked the books out but in all honesty I couldn\u2019t care less about them and I had better things to do.\n\n\n\nLike figure out where the dead-thing was watching me from.\n\nI\u2019d felt the eyes on me from the moment I opened the door but so far nothing. Some of the stains in the house were so dark green they may as well be black so it had definitely been hanging around. It had dropped the temperature a few degrees after I\u2019d checked the bathroom but I think that was more because of how long I\u2019d been here rather than where I\u2019d explored.\n\nI hate it when you know that something is watching you but you can\u2019t see it. If there was ever a better way to unnerve someone it clearly fell out of fashion some time ago. And this dead-thing was a patient one in all likelihood. In most cases they had to be.\n\nI remember this case from a few years back, not one of mine you understand. This family felt they were being haunted and called in all manner of people to check it out. Vicars, \u201cghost speakers\u201d, witch doctors and exorcists passed through the place like a tourist destination. It was quite a sensational case because whatever was haunting them was clearly malevolent. //Get out// scratched on the walls and scars on the children, you know the stuff. But whenever a quote-unquote professional took a look there was nothing to see. Proof of the activities was everywhere but there weren\u2019t any activities at all when people other than the family paid attention.\n\nSo eventually the media lost interest. People stopped discussing it by water coolers. And one by one the family were picked off and eaten alive in the space of a day and a half.\n\n\n\nBecause that\u2019s how dead-things operate. They let you know they\u2019re going to get you but they never do until you stop expecting it. They\u2019re not even playful, it\u2019s just part of the mentality.\n\nIf I recall correctly the police broke into the place a few weeks later and found what was left of the bodies stitched together and rotting on the family sofa, television remote clutched in one half-eaten hand.\n\nThey pinned it on a serial killer thankfully. I have no idea how hard the local Guardian worked to achieve that piece of magic but they have my eternal respect.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFinally something happened \u2013 a cup flew from the kitchen table and shattered against the wall. A fleck of crockery stung my cheek and I turned smiling. Obviously there was nothing there but it was or had just been in this room. I saw a flicker. I started to whistle and pretended that I hadn\u2019t. These things work easier if the target underestimates you.\n\nI wandered nonchalantly through the kitchen into the large front room. The door on the cupboard the television was sat on was hanging from its hinges. It was covered in green stains that hadn\u2019t been there last time I was in the room.\n\nI reached into my coat and pulled out an old-fashioned yo-yo. I can\u2019t remember the last time I saw anybody else with one, I think they stopped being popular not long after I was born. But they were excellent for making one look innocent. They also made good garrotte wires in a pinch given you have the right string. Don\u2019t ask me how I know.\n\nI carried on acting uninterested and stupid as I wandered through the house playing with my yo-yo. I still looked like I was looking for a ghost but I was looking the same way a presenter from some god-awful \u201cdocumentary\u201d on the paranormal would.\n\nI had a notion that it was now in the bathroom. I climbed the stairs and made my way there. It had decided to reveal itself, I think.\n\nThere\u2019s always the game before the catch, a compulsion we\u2019ve already discussed. But this one could probably smell that I was different. And that was what made me attractive.\n\nBut I\u2019d be ready. My plan was simple \u2013 I\u2019d walk in and when it manifested I\u2019d thwack it with the yo-yo.\n\nThat was the big secret about dead-things; they\u2019re completely corporeal. Sure they\u2019re the basis for ghosts but the myriad reasons for that is a subject I could probably write a book on if I ever found the time.\n\nI walked in and there was bloody writing on the mirror, of course.\n\n//You should not be here//. How original.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I felt a cold sensation behind me. A sort of hissing noise too, not so you\u2019d notice if you weren\u2019t expecting it. \n\nLazily, I turned. And my mouth dropped.\n\nBefore me stood a gaunt figure. It was partially covered in chitin and it rubbed two long hands together in a beetle-like fashion. Its eyes were plentiful and should have been on its head rather than torso but we\u2019re not all perfect. It had no face. A mouth, eyes on the torso but the head was essentially a blank dome. Blood dripped from a gaping wound on its side and there were more eyes on the inside of the gash.\n\n\u00a0It wasn\u2019t supposed to look like that.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a dead-thing.\u201d I said.\n\n\u201c**Very astute.**\u201d It smiled.\n\nThen I was asleep and I couldn\u2019t tell you why.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nI was bound to a chair in the kitchen when I opened my eyes.\n\nSeamus was there and so was the monster, they were stood side by side. Seamus looked almost reluctant but there was a hunger in his features too.\n\nHe had a melon-baller dangling loosely from one hand. He looked to the creature and it nodded. He walked over to me and its eyes span and followed him.\n\n\u201cI lied at the pub.\u201d He said, almost apologetically.\n\n\u201cYou certainly did.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2026 we needed you.\u201d\n\nThat was confusing.\n\n\u201cWhy me? Anyone you\u2019ve ever met will tell you I\u2019m nothing special.\u201d\n\nHe motioned to his face, and tried to think of the right words.\n\n\u201cYou\u2026 perceive. Things we can\u2019t. We tried for months and nothing let us. You see things that most others don\u2019t, too.\u00a0\u00a0No, other people like us.\u201d He said before I could speak.\n\n\u201cWell that\u2019s news to me, Seamus. I think your friend over there\u2019s been talking shit.\u201d\n\n\u201c**Nobody tells you that you make no sense.**\u201d It said.\n\n\u201c**On the times you converse with others, you discuss the things you\u2019ve seen and people raise not a question. Have their faces never given it away? You are a rare thing, Seeker. One that sees all that there is.**\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds totally idiotic. Believe me, if that was true I //would// notice.\" I said, but I started thinking about it. The first time I\u2019d encountered a corpse-thing I told a gentleman who I\u2019d known for a long while about the whole thing. He had raised his eyebrows at my description of it in a way that should have implied to me that he didn\u2019t know that they looked like that. That wasn\u2019t proof of course but I hadn\u2019t got where I was today by not believing things.\n\nThat in mind I //had// got where I was today by fucking up a simple investigation.\n\nSeamus looked at the monster then back to me. He dropped to my level, his face an inch from mine.\n\n\u201cWe have to take your eyes. I\u2019m sorry but we have to.\u201d\n\nHe kissed my forehead and my lips. I only hated him slightly more.\n\n\u201cI am really sorry.\u201d\n\nMy eyes flickered to the kitchen table. My yo-yo lay on it.\n\n\u201cYou do seem to be sorry.\u201d I said \u201cBut in a moment you\u2019ll be even sorrier.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He said and started digging the melon baller into my socket.\n\n\n\nI screamed. Pain shot through my skull as the jagged teeth around the cup bit through flesh. I don\u2019t know how he was planning to sever the optic nerve but he\u2019d persist until it was done. Everything went red on my right side. I screamed until I was hoarse.\n\nThe yo-yo was still there.\n\nI put up a little struggle as he worked my eye free and waited for the monster to make its move. It was smiling so eagerly. It sniffed at the air and savoured the scent of my blood. And eventually it moved closer to get a better look.\n\nWith a wet pop my eye came loose from the socket. Seamus stood back a little and looked at his work. The creature closed in, it\u2019s clawed hands raised.\n\n\n\nI spat a word that I shouldn\u2019t have been able to pronounce, and couldn\u2019t without the pain to guide my lips.\n\nThe yo-yo on the table burst in a flash of blinding dark.\n\n\n\nThere was a rending sound and maybe some screams.\n\nMy face was very wet.\n\nOnce I could see again there wasn\u2019t much left of the creature. Seamus lay on the floor, panting heavily and looking with shock at his arm. Well, where his arm should have been.\n\nI shrugged off the ropes which had been frayed to pieces.\n\nI crouched by Seamus, ignoring the pain from my eye.\n\n\u201cCheckmate my friend.\u201d I said.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nI held Seamus by the scruff of the neck and he stared at the door.\n\nIt was an unimpressive one. A flat dull piece of wood with an off-grey handle. But he knew that it held importance.\n\nSo did I, for that matter.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My eye was gone. I\u2019d had to cut it off myself, pieces of the monster (which I still didn\u2019t recognise) had clung to it and bubbles that shouldn\u2019t have appeared did. If I didn\u2019t lose the eye then I may have lost my brain, or become a slave or another one of the monsters. You never know.\n\nThe patch was good enough for now but if I wanted to keep appearances up I would have to get some mirrored glasses.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHere we go.\u201d I told Seamus after a moment.\n\nSilence, silence for a good few minutes before he replied.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want this.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody wants this. I don\u2019t want this.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen let me leave!\u201d He cried, trying to turn to look at me.\n\n\u201cWhat would you have done to me after it took my eyes, Seamus?\u201d\n\nHis shoulders sagged.\n\n\u201cI think I should correct myself in that case. I //usually// don\u2019t want this.\u201d\n\nHe stopped speaking again. I pulled him aside and put my hand on the door.\n\n\u201cMay I ask something?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou just did.\u201d\n\nHe looked at me. I rolled my eye.\n\n\u201cOne thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf\u2026\u201d he licked his lips nervously. \u201cIf it had just been a ghost. Would you still be doing\u2026 this?\u201d\n\nI looked at the door.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d I said.\n\nHis face fell.\n\n\u201cHey. You asked.\u201d I pulled the door open.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s been a pleasure, but\u2026\u201d\n\nI threw him in and closed the door. I held my hands to my ears but the screams were so loud.\n\nAfter they stopped I opened the door and went in myself.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Unknowable Thing loomed over me, a half-digested and catatonic Seamus lay below It.\n\n\u201cHere we are. One scumbag supreme. And the monster fucker is gone too.\u201d\n\nIt questioned me.\n\n\u201cBlown to bits. Not coming back. As specified.\u201d\n\nIt was satisfied.\n\nI looked around, almost looked up at It but remembered what happened the last time I looked at It directly.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me why they wanted me.\u201d\n\nThe Unknowable Thing asked a question.\n\n\u201cHell yes it was important! The only reason I survived is because of that bloody toy! What if I hadn\u2019t brought it along, huh? Then where\u2019d you be?\u201d\n\nIt commented.\n\nI raised a finger.\n\n\u201cBullshit. If I was that dispensable I wouldn\u2019t be standing here. You\u2019d have found someone else.\u201d\n\nThe Unknowable Thing conceded.\n\nI\u2019d already had enough. Talking to the Unknowable Thing always drains you.\n\nI turned to leave and It let me. I was at the door before I turned and asked a question.\n\n\u201cIs it true? What the monster said about me?\u201d\n\nIt answered.\n\nI nodded and stepped out the door and up the cellar steps.\n\n\n\nGod but I needed a drink. As always.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that\u2019s just how it is in my line of work.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "licensing-guide", "licensing-master-list"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "tale"], "title": "Housework - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/housework", "year": 2011}, "in-the-land-of-the-blind": {"created_at": "2011-01-31T21:26:00", "creator": "Sorts", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Sorts", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sorts", "comment": "", "date": "2011-01-31T21:26:00"}, {"author": "Sorts", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sorts", "comment": "", "date": "2011-01-31T23:48:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

Enough of a classic Greek education to choose Echidna, but name all four of your kids Jack? That's just re-cock-ulous.\n<p>Huh? Oh, you know, re-cock-ulous, even worse than ridiculous? Come on, you knows it's funny. Where was- Oh yeah, the names. Like Joh. That would be Jack of Hearts to you. We all do that, shorten our names, makes it easier. But, yeah, Joh. How much easier would it have been to name him Pan? And Jos, he coulda been, uhm, well Cthulhu, right? I mean, okay, not Greek, but still squidy. And Jackie, you have no idea how much I hate her for the idea of using and i e on to the end of her name, she coulda been Anansi! No, he's not female, but still, it's better than Jack of Diamonds. And me? Hell! I coulda been so many things!Skoll, Hati, Lon Chaney, Larry Talbot, hell I coulda been Fenrir! That's a name to strike fear into people's hearts. Fenrir, the great wolf! I mean, she coulda even just named me Wolf, or Lobo, and it woulda been awesome.</p>\n<p>And of course, the Kings and Queens all get named after famous ones. And the others\u2026 Okay, maybe the Deuces have it worse. No real identity to speak of. Even then, Deuce sounds cool, right? 'Who are you?' 'They call me Deuce.'

Coulda been anything, hells I'd have taken Loup-Garou!</p>\n<p>But no. I'm the mother fucking Jack of Clubs. Or, Joc, as my siblings call me. Makes me feel like I should be french or something. I blame Mom. And the good Doctor. Hmm? The Good Doctor? It's what we always called him, cause he used so many different names, all the god damn time. I think you guys know him as Dr. Prometheus. Fire bringer my ass. Guy just likes to fiddle, with fucking EVERYTHING. Which was why he put up with Mom, I suppose. What he could do with inanimate objects, she could do with DNA.

Yeah, we each have to meet specific challenges in order to pass on our seed. Joh needs them to trust him. Jos needs to know them intimately, without them ever knowing him. Jackie only goes for rapists who love her. Me? I need consent. They need to tell me it's okay, before I can work my magic. Gotta think I'm one of them.</p>\n<p>It's harder than you think. I don't exactly look normal, y'know? I'm big, and burly, and I exude this whole 'predator' scent or something. Most of the girls have a sorta prey instinct to them, so a big hungry predator walking up and saying 'Hey, wanna bone?' just doesn't work. I gotta be subtle. Disguise my scent. That's what the skin is for. I wrap myself in the skin of someone they knew, and it's like, bam, he doesn't look so bad. Ok, so I like 'em dumb. Works better, yeah? Maybe a little of it is my own special magic, so they don't notice I'm wearing a butchered carcass.</p>\n<p>Not that they matter to me much after I do the dirty deed. My little babies get born hungry. No, I'm not much a loving parent. None of us are. But my little cubs can survive on their own. Instinct, yeah?</p>\n<p>Oh, yeah, that last girl. God, she was sexy. Beautiful eyes like limpid pools of moonlight. Soft, black hair, all curly and nice. Such beautiful full lips. Oh, I knew from the moment I saw her, I had to have her. I knew she'd be perfect for one of my little babies. It took a while. I'm not used to finding such perfect girls, usually I have to hunt over hill and under dale to find such a sweet thing.</p>\n<p>So, I lured one of her little friends away, the friend wasn't as cute as my babe. Lure her off with the promise of a good time, maybe a nice meal. Not a bad sort, very trusting. But, I broke her neck anyways, before she could utter a single peep. I skinned her. I've always been good at such things. Natural claws, y'know? Anyways, simple enough to wrap this girls skin around me, like a cloak. Totally worked. I got close to my babe, my beautiful girl. Took about a week, of just, hanging around, and she got comfortable with me.</p>\n<p>Then I worked my magic. A nudge here, a comment there, and, before you know it, she was ready. all I needed was the word.

My name is Dr. Eisenberg. Now, all of you are probably asking yourself 'Who the hell is that?' and 'Why isn't someone like Dr. Gears introducing us instead, being that he's head of the research site?' Let me put it this way. That monkey you saw down the hallway? That's Dr. Bright. Like Dr. Gears, he is Level 4 Research Staff, which means he is considered about as important as two-three roomfuls of you here\u2026 including myself. It also means they get to ehm, relegate administrative tasks, so do level 3's, the shit falls through\u2026 you'll see. But it isn't so bad.</p>\n<p>\"Now, all of you here folks joined the Foundation because we pay off your college debt, pay you a decent salary, and allow you to get your doctorates done. We're kinda like the army, just that we don't make anyone march uphill like an idiot.</p>\n<p>\"Now, good news is, we don't care what college you went into, as long as you have a working head on your shoulders - for one, as you probably heard, what we got here doesn't only fuck with physics, it makes porn of it, so there's hundreds of experiments that need to be run, and that's what we need you for. And for two, you will be working as assistants to other researchers, who will outline your tasks in a way that doesn't require you to go through tons of theory. You carry out the experiments, you write down the findings carefully and anything unexpected even more carefully, and that's pretty much it for 90% of the time.</p>\n<p>\"However, it isn't all that easy, and I'd like to say a few things to help you survive until it pays off. See, you might hear essentially everyone else bitching about how hard and risky their job is, but it's a matter of fact that the researchers aren't any better off. Intel just watches stuff from afar, if an MTF sees something they don't like, they get to 'retreat', but we, not only have nowhere to go if shit hits the fan, we have to take whatever they bring in, and prod it until we find out what exactly does it do, and how to prevent it from doing that without control. So, listen carefully.</p>\n<p>\"Now, first, SCPs\u2026 they probably told you the gist of what we do here on the main briefing, with all the other folks there - the supposed House MD's and James Bonds and John Rambos, so I don't need to go through all that shit. Now, if you're in direct contact with a Keter class object you're likely fucked, and well, pure Euclids you'll meet only during initial containment, and there's little advice I can give you for that. What I'll speak about are the 'Safe's'. The bureaucratic cunt who thought up that name probably never seen one.</p>\n<p>\"Do <strong>not</strong> fuck about with a safe SCP, and mainly, do <strong>not</strong> let your guard down. The most dangerous times when researching an object isn't the first time you're around it, it's the umpteenth time you've been asked to collect a bunch of data, think you know exactly what it can do, and get careless. Might seem odd now, but you will begin thinking like that, no matter how weird or dangerous the item you work with is. It's human nature, something about psychological baselines but I'm a metallurgist, not a shrink. I guess it's so since in most of the world, if something does A for five hundred times, it won't do B for the five hundredth one time.</p>\n<p>\"Here, not so much - it's how half the stuff in containment gets their 'Euclid'. For example, the two staff that died swilling their own shit because of one nine eight - shapeshifter cup from the devil's mother we thought we had contained. One of them was a researcher like you, and all he did was reach for what he thought was his own thermos on the desk in front of him - turns out the bloody thing teleports every so often.</p>\n<p>\"Second thing. D-Class. Disposables. The folks in orange jumpsuits recruited from death row inmates. Their main official purpose is to manipulate Keter class objects so that we don't have to. That much you heard on the briefing. They are also used for human testing of SCPs. Now, listen well, and you back there, try looking a bit less freaked out - we aren't fucking Schutzstaffel.</p>\n<p>\"Now, the official documents say they are terminated at the end of each month, and so will die anyways. Now, I seriously doubt that, given the amount of them even I use, and since you aren't brain dead, you will probably doubt it too. You might even get reluctant to terminate D-classes that you have run a set of experiments on.</p>\n<p>\"Let me run with a practical example. One of the memetic SCPs we had on site, relatively harmless thing, a jingle or a song of sort. There, with the suspenders? What's a meme? How can I put it\u2026 memes are malicious ideas. They break your mind's programming if they are read in, from any source. Sort of like the computer viruses bored Bulgarian youths write - no matter if it's from a floppy or email attachment, it does the same, whether it's displaying a silly message, or making your hard disk plow. Over there? What? That's a cognitohazard, not a meme? You're probably right, I don't work with these\u2026 either way, what it does is more important to what it's called.</p>\n<p>\"Either way, researcher who did the testing was 'humanistic' - he didn't know better. Returned the D-class he used to the pool, not even with a note about what's been done. A few days later, we contained another memetic SCP, one that killed people, it was an image. Another researcher who ran tests on that one, by incidence, took in the same D-class. In his mind, the two memes merged somehow. From what the camera feeds show, the man started babbling, then tore his own trachea out, and so did the researcher and the two security staff present.</p>\n<p>\"So yes. There's a reason why their papers contain a short summary of what they were sentenced for, beyond selecting a fitting psychological profile for SCP testing. Read it through. And any time you get the urge of returning a used D-class back to the pool, think to yourself: 'Is prolonging the life of a rapist worth risking the life of my colleagues and friends?'.</p>\n<p>\"Now, that's all of me, really. Questions?</p>\n<p>\"You with that look? Demotion to D-class? Ah fuck, who told you that? I thought so\u2026 see, that, and Keter duty is one of the pieces of bullshit we scare the greenhorns with. Now, see\u2026 most of the ways you can fuck up here, we'll have no one to punish, and taking out sensitive information, they'd kill you for that everywhere.</p>\n<p>\"Next one. Why do you have to stay on site? Probation period, really. For the next six months. Those who go through it, you'll get your level 1 permanent clearances, and will be able to spend their time off wherever. Those who don't\u2026 you'll get class B amnestics and forget everything you ever experienced here. Which isn't as bad as it sounds - we'll still give you the salary.</p>\n<p>\"Guy in polo shirt? Where's the best place to meet women in here? The Internet\u2026 Joking. Try Bio section's staff break room, lots of cute girls there, like Rights.</p>\n<p>\"You there, girl with glasses? Why don't we research the objects so they can help mankind? Well, I could say that\u2026 Screw it. Know what? You can. If you succeed, and develop a theory that explains and reproduces an object, it'll get reclassified as SCP-EX, leaked to the public, and you might get a promotion out of it. So far, I have heard of about five people succeeding\u2026 in the last century. Hell, I'm still trying to work out what triggers structural cancer, and the six of us have been messing with it for two years by now.</p>\n<p>\"Go on. What do you need to get promoted? Ambitious, aren't we? Well, goes like this. You finish your degree, and then you either leave with the civies, or you stay with us, sign a permanent contract, and get level 2 clearance. After that, it's a matter of luck and arseclimbery, and since I have neither, I'm still stuck as a Researcher.</p>\n<p>\"Another girl? A dog somehow got into the on-site showers? That'd be Professor Crow. Next time he does that, steal his glasses.</p>\n<p>\"Anyways, you're all dismissed - in a while, security personnel will escort you to the researchers that you'll be working for. In the meantime there's some coffee and donuts here too, so help yourself.\"</p>\n</div></body></html>", "raw_source": "\n\t[[>]]\n\n[[module Rate]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n\"Welcome to the Level 1 Research Staff Laboratory Induction. My name is Dr. Eisenberg. Now, all of you are probably asking yourself 'Who the hell is that?' and 'Why isn't someone like Dr. Gears introducing us instead, being that he's head of the research site?' Let me put it this way. That monkey you saw down the hallway? That's Dr. Bright. Like Dr. Gears, he is Level 4 Research Staff, which means he is considered about as important as two-three roomfuls of you here... including myself. It also means they get to ehm, relegate administrative tasks, so do level 3's, the shit falls through... you'll see. But it isn't so bad.\n\n\n\n\"Now, all of you here folks joined the Foundation because we pay off your college debt, pay you a decent salary, and allow you to get your doctorates done. We're kinda like the army, just that we don't make anyone march uphill like an idiot.\n\n\n\n\"Now, good news is, we don't care what college you went into, as long as you have a working head on your shoulders - for one, as you probably heard, what we got here doesn't only fuck with physics, it makes porn of it, so there's hundreds of experiments that need to be run, and that's what we need you for. And for two, you will be working as assistants to other researchers, who will outline your tasks in a way that doesn't require you to go through tons of theory. You carry out the experiments, you write down the findings carefully and anything unexpected even more carefully, and that's pretty much it for 90% of the time.\n\n\n\n\"However, it isn't all that easy, and I'd like to say a few things to help you survive until it pays off. See, you might hear essentially everyone else bitching about how hard and risky their job is, but it's a matter of fact that the researchers aren't any better off. Intel just watches stuff from afar, if an MTF sees something they don't like, they get to 'retreat', but we, not only have nowhere to go if shit hits the fan, we have to take whatever they bring in, and prod it until we find out what exactly does it do, and how to prevent it from doing that without control. So, listen carefully.\n\n\n\n\"Now, first, SCPs... they probably told you the gist of what we do here on the main briefing, with all the other folks there - the supposed House MD's and James Bonds and John Rambos, so I don't need to go through all that shit. Now, if you're in direct contact with a Keter class object you're likely fucked, and well, pure Euclids you'll meet only during initial containment, and there's little advice I can give you for that. What I'll speak about are the 'Safe's'. The bureaucratic cunt who thought up that name probably never seen one.\n\n\n\n\"Do **not** fuck about with a safe SCP, and mainly, do **not** let your guard down. The most dangerous times when researching an object isn't the first time you're around it, it's the umpteenth time you've been asked to collect a bunch of data, think you know exactly what it can do, and get careless. Might seem odd now, but you will begin thinking like that, no matter how weird or dangerous the item you work with is. It's human nature, something about psychological baselines but I'm a metallurgist, not a shrink. I guess it's so since in most of the world, if something does A for five hundred times, it won't do B for the five hundredth one time.\n\n\n\n\"Here, not so much - it's how half the stuff in containment gets their 'Euclid'. For example, the two staff that died swilling their own shit because of one nine eight - shapeshifter cup from the devil's mother we thought we had contained. One of them was a researcher like you, and all he did was reach for what he thought was his own thermos on the desk in front of him - turns out the bloody thing teleports every so often.\n\n\n\n\"Second thing. D-Class. Disposables. The folks in orange jumpsuits recruited from death row inmates. Their main official purpose is to manipulate Keter class objects so that we don't have to. That much you heard on the briefing. They are also used for human testing of SCPs. Now, listen well, and you back there, try looking a bit less freaked out - we aren't fucking Schutzstaffel.\n\n\n\n\"Now, the official documents say they are terminated at the end of each month, and so will die anyways. Now, I seriously doubt that, given the amount of them even I use, and since you aren't brain dead, you will probably doubt it too. You might even get reluctant to terminate D-classes that you have run a set of experiments on.\n\n\n\n\"Let me run with a practical example. One of the memetic SCPs we had on site, relatively harmless thing, a jingle or a song of sort. There, with the suspenders? What's a meme? How can I put it... memes are malicious ideas. They break your mind's programming if they are read in, from any source. Sort of like the computer viruses bored Bulgarian youths write - no matter if it's from a floppy or email attachment, it does the same, whether it's displaying a silly message, or making your hard disk plow. Over there? What? That's a cognitohazard, not a meme? You're probably right, I don't work with these... either way, what it does is more important to what it's called.\n\n\n\n\"Either way, researcher who did the testing was 'humanistic' - he didn't know better. Returned the D-class he used to the pool, not even with a note about what's been done. A few days later, we contained another memetic SCP, one that killed people, it was an image. Another researcher who ran tests on that one, by incidence, took in the same D-class. In his mind, the two memes merged somehow. From what the camera feeds show, the man started babbling, then tore his own trachea out, and so did the researcher and the two security staff present.\n\n\n\n\"So yes. There's a reason why their papers contain a short summary of what they were sentenced for, beyond selecting a fitting psychological profile for SCP testing. Read it through. And any time you get the urge of returning a used D-class back to the pool, think to yourself: 'Is prolonging the life of a rapist worth risking the life of my colleagues and friends?'.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Now, that's all of me, really. Questions?\n\n\n\n\"You with that look? Demotion to D-class? Ah fuck, who told you that? I thought so... see, that, and Keter duty is one of the pieces of bullshit we scare the greenhorns with. Now, see... most of the ways you can fuck up here, we'll have no one to punish, and taking out sensitive information, they'd kill you for that everywhere.\n\n\n\n\"Next one. Why do you have to stay on site? Probation period, really. For the next six months. Those who go through it, you'll get your level 1 permanent clearances, and will be able to spend their time off wherever. Those who don't... you'll get class B amnestics and forget everything you ever experienced here. Which isn't as bad as it sounds - we'll still give you the salary.\n\n\n\n\"Guy in polo shirt? Where's the best place to meet women in here? The Internet... Joking. Try Bio section's staff break room, lots of cute girls there, like Rights.\n\n\n\n\"You there, girl with glasses? Why don't we research the objects so they can help mankind? Well, I could say that... Screw it. Know what? You can. If you succeed, and develop a theory that explains and reproduces an object, it'll get reclassified as SCP-EX, leaked to the public, and you might get a promotion out of it. So far, I have heard of about five people succeeding... in the last century. Hell, I'm still trying to work out what triggers structural cancer, and the six of us have been messing with it for two years by now.\n\n\n\n\"Go on. What do you need to get promoted? Ambitious, aren't we? Well, goes like this. You finish your degree, and then you either leave with the civies, or you stay with us, sign a permanent contract, and get level 2 clearance. After that, it's a matter of luck and arseclimbery, and since I have neither, I'm still stuck as a Researcher.\n\n\n\n\"Another girl? A dog somehow got into the on-site showers? That'd be Professor Crow. Next time he does that, steal his glasses. \n\n\n\n\"Anyways, you're all dismissed - in a while, security personnel will escort you to the researchers that you'll be working for. In the meantime there's some coffee and donuts here too, so help yourself.\"\n", "references": [], "tags": ["kain-pathos-crow", "orientation", "tale"], "title": "Lab Induction - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/lab-induction", "year": 2011}, "learning-shit": {"created_at": "2011-10-07T06:52:00", "creator": "MisterBibs", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "MisterBibs", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/misterbibs", "comment": "In the vein of Orientation and Clef101, I present Learning Shit.

I'm Agent Bibs. If you really have a hard-on for being formal, call me Mister Bibs. I don't, so if you call me Mister Bibs, I'll throw a pen cap at you. Now, I've got a few guesses as to why the higher-ups wanted <em>me</em> to run this class, but I'll deal with that later. For right now, you get the oh-so-wonderful privilege of hearing me talk about being an Intelligence Agent for the Foundation.</p>\n<p>You know, I think I'm going to like this group. This isn't me slobbing your knobs or anything, I'm <em>serious</em>! See, most of you screwheads didn't pick up any of the food and drinks. It means you don't trust free food given out by someone you don't know. That's a good thing, because in about three seconds..</p>\n<p>Okay, so I'm off by two seconds, plus or minus. Hey, using knock-out drops is an inexact science! Which is good, because I'm not all that good on the whole 'science' thing. They only gave me the Researcher role because I kept figuring out what the eggheads were going to do before they did it, for Christ's sake.</p>\n<p>While the Ds get the idiots out of here, let's get down to business. By the way, D-44632, take Fred there to a Cell. He's Church.</p>\n<p>Now, how did I know all this, you lunkheads? Am I a genius? Well, kinda, but that's not the point. The point is, before you guys came in and sat down, I went over each and every one of your dossiers. The ones you gave us, and the ones my fellow IAs compiled on each and every one of you. It's how I realized the majority of this group wouldn't take food from a stranger, and how Fred was a Church plant.</p>\n<p>I don't do all this background-looking-into shit because it's impressive to newbies. Well, partially I do. Mostly, though, its because it's my <em>job</em> to know shit. It's my job because the Foundation needs to know shit. Shit we don't know about, we can't keep people safe from. Yes, James-Who-Wet-The-Bed-Until-He-Was-Six, I said <em>people</em>. Let the eggheads frame things in a way that lets them avoid thinking about seven billion people. You're Agents. You're dealing with people. Good people, bad people, good bad people, bad good people. And Clef, I guess, He's not really 'people', though.. I think.</p>\n<p>No, Alexander, put your hand down. I'm not going to talk about Clef. He's one of your bosses, and he's smarter than you, and seeking out more than that'll give you a headache. But <em>no</em>, you're going to think you're smart enough to find the truth about him. If you're lucky, he'll warn you off. If you're not, he'll tell you everything. Don't pout, Alex. Prove me wrong. It happens so rarely, I'm going to sit down and put my feet up on the table to complete the Arrogant Prick Look. Yes, these <em>are</em> gym shoes. Running in dress shoes is a bitch and a half. 48% of IA's job is based on running.</p>\n<p>Anyways, being an IA? You'll get up, and you'll find a folder on your table. Or, in my case, stuck to the wall of the Containment Cell I took over when they decided to recruit my surprisingly-firm ass. It'll be all professional-like, brief as hell. We're talking location, rough approximation of what the higher-ups expect, how you'll be getting there, maybe a few suggestions on attire and the like. I'd tell you to ignore the last one, but if I do that, you'll wear a clownsuit to a GoC facility. That only works <em>once</em>. Or twice, if you count that time in March.</p>\n<p>On the way to wherever you're going, you'll be studying the location. Not the quote-unquote specific Foundation stuff, no. I'm talking about cultural shit. Do the people where you're going have a strong oral tradition? Are the men or women more open to talking to people? Do they respond well to authority, or is it better to be One Of The Guys? You're here because you either know that kinda shit already, or you know people who know people who know that shit. As long as you don't tell your buddies you're with the Foundation, nobody here <em>really</em> gives a rat's ass who you talk to. Yeah, the higher-ups talk about Super Obnoxious Secrecy In All Things, but that's because most of them were never Agents in the first place.</p>\n<p>You'll get to wherever you need to go, and then the fun stuff starts. If there's places the Foundation wants you to examine, you do it. Otherwise, do whatever you need to do. Go into a bar. Drink a bit, talk with the locals. Ask if there's been any crazy stories floating about. Most aren't relevant to what you're doing, but learn them anyway. You'll build trust, and you'll have new cover stories for your next few missions. Take notes. Follow up on those notes, make sure they are legit. In short, learn shit. That's why the Foundation pays you a lot of goddamned money, and why you're here instead of wherever you were.</p>\n<p><em>No</em>, Matt, <em>don't</em> raise your hand. Nobody cares you used to work with the CIA. I ran loops around your former boss's head a few months after I started here. I think I got him fired for it, now that I think about it. Long story. His fault. Yes, I'm aware he was your father. I'm talking, you're not. I speak, you learn shit. From my massive brain to your probably-larger-but-empty brain. Seriously, I don't know if anyone has told you, but your head is <em>huge</em>!</p>\n<p>As I was saying\u2026 you've done your canvassing and networking, and you've found what the higher-ups are looking for. You've got as much info as you can get on the thing: where exactly it is, best way and time to get at it, things to know to ensure a clean retrieval. If y'have to ask yourself if you've learned enough shit, y'aint learned enough shit. You want your fellow Foundationites thinking you're anal-retentive. Actually, scratch that: <em>be</em> anal-retentive. If you don't put down that the skip turns blue at 11:34pm on Fridays, <em>someone is going to fucking die</em>.</p>\n<p>This is when you expect me to chuckle and point out how pointless that sort of detail is. Newsflash: you're in the Foundation, now. Stuff turning blue can and will cause someone to die. I've seen it happen.</p>\n<p>And since I have three of you guys flagged for wanting to play hero, I'm going to make this very clear to everyone: don't be James Goddamned Bond. You're Intelligence, dammit, and running in to capture a skip on your own is going to get your ass killed. Leave it to Retrieval and Containment agents. Let them get <em>their</em> asses killed. Nah, if R&amp;C teams get killed, you didn't give them enough shit to go on. See these names on my arm? Three men died because I failed to give them enough information for a clean retrieval. I don't plan on adding any more. I'm not sure if you guys know this, but tattoos? They hurt!</p>\n<p>Actually, here's a teaching moment: don't get tattoos. Ink identifies you, and your job as an Intelligence Agent is <em>not to be fucking identified</em>. I know what you're thinking: <em>\"Why is Bibs allowed to get one, and I'm not?\"</em> First off, I'm better at being an IA than you. Secondly, I've been here longer than you, and I'm granted wider latitude. Thirdly, I was the one who discovered an anomalous brand of ink that vanishes when you mentally will it to.</p>\n<p>Okay, it's <em>mostly</em> the third one, but the first two still apply. And no, you don't get the special ink. I found it, and it was the one anomalous item I got to take possession of this year.</p>\n<p>Shit, I'm digressing again. Anyway, back to being an IA. When you're done with getting all your shit together, get out of there without making a fuss. On your way home, write up your reports. When you reach your home Site, you'll be formally debriefed. The shit you provide will be filed and processed, into a form that R&amp;Cs won't even bother reading, because it's all about how to get to their goal without shooting everything in sight. I'm kidding. Sort of.</p>\n<p>Oh, and one last thing before I dismiss you guys: being an Intelligence Agent isn't just about getting into places. It's also about getting out of places. While we've been talking, this entire room has been moved and deposited into a one of our larger Containment Cells. Quite a few exits head back to the facility, and each one seals off after one person uses it. You're being timed.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Okay, this is bullshit. I told the techs that I wanted the lights to go out when I said \"You're being timed\". I thought it would be badass. New lesson: never trust Bill. That motherfucker always thinks it's funny to ruin the <em>one</em> moment I get to look all bad-ass to newbies. You know what, you guys are dismissed, I'm going to\u2026</p>\n<p>Oh, there they go. <em>Christ</em>, I forgot how dark it gets. So yeah, forget that stuff about Bill. Find your way out, and have fun with it! I'll be here, taking a nap.</p>\n</div></body></html>", "raw_source": "\n\t[[>]]\n\n[[module Rate]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\nHey, everyone. I'm Agent Bibs.

The shit you provide will be filed and processed, into a form that R&Cs won't even bother reading, because it's all about how to get to their goal without shooting everything in sight. I'm kidding. Sort of.\n\n\n\nOh, and one last thing before I dismiss you guys: being an Intelligence Agent isn't just about getting into places. It's also about getting out of places. While we've been talking, this entire room has been moved and deposited into a one of our larger Containment Cells. Quite a few exits head back to the facility, and each one seals off after one person uses it. You're being timed. \n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nOkay, this is bullshit. I told the techs that I wanted the lights to go out when I said \"You're being timed\". I thought it would be badass. New lesson: never trust Bill. That motherfucker always thinks it's funny to ruin the //one// moment I get to look all bad-ass to newbies. You know what, you guys are dismissed, I'm going to...\n\n\n\nOh, there they go. //Christ//, I forgot how dark it gets. So yeah, forget that stuff about Bill. Find your way out, and have fun with it! I'll be here, taking a nap.\n", "references": [], "tags": ["orientation", "tale"], "title": "Learning Shit - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/learning-shit", "year": 2011}, "life-saver": {"created_at": "2011-10-22T21:25:00", "creator": "Dr Gears", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Dr Gears", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-gears", "comment": "", "date": "2011-10-22T21:25:00"}, {"author": "Dr Gears", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-gears", "comment": "", "date": "2011-10-22T21:27:00"}, {"author": "Chubert", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/chubert", "comment": "\"in to wreckage\" -> \"in the wreckage\"", "date": "2011-10-22T23:50:00"}, {"author": "Salman Corbette", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/salman-corbette", "comment": "Typo", "date": "2011-10-23T05:02:00"}, {"author": "Aelanna", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aelanna", "comment": "Added tags: creepypasta, tale.

I sat on the ledge, swinging my feet in to space off the top of my fourteen floor apartment building, feeling that giddy, self-destructive tingle in my feet that I always get when I'm near a steep drop-off. It was cold, and I could see a few cars slipping along the dark streets\u2026oddly, I worried for a second I would hit one on the way down, and thereby go from tragic suicide to an asshole. I was laughing at how dumb that was to worry about when I heard the guy behind me say \u201cThe hell you doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>I whipped around, kind of wobbling for a second, and saw some big guy in a blue suit smoking a cigarette. He had dark hair, was really pale\u2026I hadn't seen him on the way up, and didn't really remember hearing the door open or shut\u2026then again, my mind was kinda elsewhere. He gestured to me, saying \u201cyou gonna jump or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cuh\u2026I mean\u2026yeah, I guess. Are\u2026you like a cop or something?\u201d I felt stupid asking, but he had that weird aura of authority I always associate with cops. That's all I needed, to get arrested.</p>\n<p>He kinda chuckled, taking a deep drag. \u201cNaw, just up for the view. Got nobody to live for, nothing to stick around for?\u201d</p>\n<p>I sighed, and gave him a nutshell of what was going on. It felt somewhat good to tell someone, but at the same time it made me feel like a even bigger loser.</p>\n<p>He laughed at me. More of a chuckle, but still, it seemed kinda misplaced for the situation. He lit a new cigarette off his old one, and nodded at me.</p>\n<p>\u201cOk kiddo, that's pretty bad\u2026but let me make you a deal. You go ahead and jump, and you'll get loose of all this. However, as soon as I finish my smoke, I'm going to go downstairs and wait for you to hit. Before anyone else gets there, I'm going to steal your wallet, and I'm going to use your driver's license to look up who you are. I'm going to hack in to your social networking stuff, and find everyone who you have loved or has ever loved you, and I'm going to hurt them for a while, then kill them.\u201d</p>\n<p>I just stared, somehow positive I'd just hallucinated that somehow. I didn't even speak, just stared at this psycho.</p>\n<p>\u201cI'm going to kidnap some, and torture them out in the woods for hours before I gut them and leave them for the wolves. I'm going to shoot others in their cars, letting them roll on in the wreckage as they try to figure out why their lungs won't expand anymore. I will butcher loved ones, class mates, every friend you've known.\u201d He didn't even sound excited while he said this, like he was telling me the time.</p>\n<p>\u201cW-what the fuck is wrong with you? You can't\u2026.you can't do that, you fucking psycho!\u201d I was shaking, and not at ALL from the cold. This guy\u2026I mean, I didn't know him from anyone, it was possible\u2026It was insane, but this guy had a\u2026weird aura around him. As I watched him, I didn't for one second think he was telling a lie.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe hell do you care? You're going to be dead. You're opting out of giving a shit about the world, you don't get to bitch about what happens after you leave.\u201d He just kept staring at me with this blank expression.</p>\n<p>I freaked out. I jumped back on the roof and just ran like hell for my apartment. I called the cops, saying some guy had been on the roof, threatened my life. When they showed up, he was long gone. Nobody in the apartment knew him, I'd never seen him before or since. I ended up not getting a STD and managed to find a (shitty) job at the local grocery store, but I did have to move to a much smaller apartment. Still not really over my girlfriend, but it will take time.</p>\n<p>I still think about that night, now and then. It was just so incredibly odd, I don't think I'll ever really forget it. I have no idea if the guy was bullshitting, but I really don't think he was. It looks so dumb on paper, but if you could have seen him\u2026heard him\u2026you wouldn't really question it either. How sick of a person do you have to be, to save them from suicide by threatening them with something so horrible they don't dare leave the world unsupervised. Every time I see a unsolved, horrific murder on the news, I wonder.</p>\n<p>People ask me what I think happened that night.

Not overly flashy to begin with, the interior been rendered a wreck by Harken's chain smoking, snacking, and general disregard for property. Perfect camouflage yes, but even with her olfactory senses dialed all the way down, it still stank of smoke, sweat and nervous tension.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou still in there, cupcake?\u201d he asked, tapping on her nose. Almost before he'd touched her, five scalpel-sharp blades sprung from her thin fingers, the lethal hand poised a hair's breadth from Harken's eyes. He pulled his hand back with a smirk, more amused then afraid. \u201cAt least you're still with us. So how are we doing this?\u201d</p>\n<p>She ignored him, turning to look at the \u201cOpen Hands Outreach Center\u201d across the street. A combined thrift store and community outreach center, it was also a cover for one of the largest Church of The Broken God communities in the midwest, with an extensive underground network of rooms and tunnels stretching far and deep. She absently cycled to infrared, watching the vague heat-ghosts wander through the building.</p>\n<p>\"We are not doing anything. You are supporting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh to hell with that, you can't smash up a church all by-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYOU can't hit the broad side of a barn with a shotgun, and you have all the physical combat skills of toast.\u201d</p>\n<p>He huffed, throwing up his hands. It was cheap, childish, and absolutely true.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere's a vent beside the air conditioner that leads to the main chamber. I can dislocate my ribs, arms and legs, and slip down almost on top of them.\u201d She smiled with predatory satisfaction.</p>\n<p>He cringed, looking at her sidelong. \u201cJesus, do it the hard way, why don't you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt's the quickest way in. I can't just crash the front door, and waiting for the bishop to come out and wander into a bullet could take weeks. Quick in, quick out, no time for anyone to really realize we're here\u2026 it's sneaky. I thought you'd be pleased.\u201d She grinned at him, radiating the sweetness of a cat with a bloody muzzle.</p>\n<p>Harken stared at her, eyes half-lidded, mouth a grim line. \u201cYou're full of shit, you know that, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy, what ever do you mean, Agent Harken?\u201d Kramer was practically purring now, her voice tinged with a nearly seductive anticipation that had nothing to do with sex.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou just want to watch everyone run in terror.\u201d</p>\n<p>She smiled, stepping out of the car with a wink. \u201cSee you after work, sweety,\u201d she giggled, winking a eye cycling between green, yellow and white, striding across the street with a exaggerated wiggle of her thin hips.</p>\n<p>Harken smouldered in impotent, frustrated fury, managing to light two cigarettes backwards before letting it go.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The brothers walked down the hall slowly, heads bowed, the dull beat of the machinery deep below them like the warm pulse of a mother's heart. The two men stepped in time to the throb, letting it fill their Broken bodies, the richness of the Silent Voice tugging deep inside. Their reverie was so deep, so profound, they didn't hear the wall grate open, the soft sound of scraping flesh as it oozed from the confined space.</p>\n<p>Brother Cam looked up at a sudden noise, his meditation broken by what sounded like a\u2026a chirp, or a squeal. He looked, then suddenly turned more, searching, trying to find Brother Han. He'd been right there, walking beside him. Brother Cam heard another noise, like a soft tap, and he leaned in to the semi-dark hall, trying to place the sound.</p>\n<p>A thick metal hook tore his skull open like a rusty can.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The bishop Bronzon could feel the devotion like a wind on his face. The sanctuary was filled, every body singing in time to the Great Machine well below them. Since the hated heretics had been silenced, the Church had swollen with faith, initiates, and the most sacred of relics, shards of The Broken itself.

It was only when he tried to open the panic room, and found it locked, that he felt that fear again, bright and sweet, like biting on a rotten tooth.</p>\n<p>The screaming had died down, just a few wheezing, bubbling hisses, the odd flapping or brushing sound as some ruined limb tried to drag its dying body away.

Not overly flashy to begin with, the interior been rendered a wreck by Harken's chain smoking, snacking, and general disregard for property. Perfect camouflage yes, but even with her olfactory senses dialed all the way down, it still stank of smoke, sweat and nervous tension.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou still in there, cupcake?\u201d he asked, tapping on her nose. Almost before he'd touched her, five scalpel-sharp blades sprung from her thin fingers, the lethal hand poised a hair's breadth from Harken's eyes. He pulled his hand back with a smirk, more amused then afraid. \u201cAt least you're still with us. So how are we doing this?\u201d\n\n\n\nShe ignored him, turning to look at the \u201cOpen Hands Outreach Center\u201d across the street. A combined thrift store and community outreach center, it was also a cover for one of the largest Church of The Broken God communities in the midwest, with an extensive underground network of rooms and tunnels stretching far and deep. She absently cycled to infrared, watching the vague heat-ghosts wander through the building.\n\n\n\n\"We are not doing anything. You are supporting.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh to hell with that, you can't smash up a church all by-\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYOU can't hit the broad side of a barn with a shotgun, and you have all the physical combat skills of toast.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe huffed, throwing up his hands. It was cheap, childish, and absolutely true.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere's a vent beside the air conditioner that leads to the main chamber. I can dislocate my ribs, arms and legs, and slip down almost on top of them.\u201d She smiled with predatory satisfaction.\n\n\n\nHe cringed, looking at her sidelong. \u201cJesus, do it the hard way, why don't you?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt's the quickest way in. I can't just crash the front door, and waiting for the bishop to come out and wander into a bullet could take weeks. Quick in, quick out, no time for anyone to really realize we're here\u2026 it's sneaky. I thought you'd be pleased.\u201d She grinned at him, radiating the sweetness of a cat with a bloody muzzle.\n\n\n\nHarken stared at her, eyes half-lidded, mouth a grim line. \u201cYou're full of shit, you know that, right?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMy, what ever do you mean, Agent Harken?\u201d Kramer was practically purring now, her voice tinged with a nearly seductive anticipation that had nothing to do with sex.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou just want to watch everyone run in terror.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe smiled, stepping out of the car with a wink. \u201cSee you after work, sweety,\u201d she giggled, winking a eye cycling between green, yellow and white, striding across the street with a exaggerated wiggle of her thin hips.\n\n\n\nHarken smouldered in impotent, frustrated fury, managing to light two cigarettes backwards before letting it go.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nThe brothers walked down the hall slowly, heads bowed, the dull beat of the machinery deep below them like the warm pulse of a mother's heart. The two men stepped in time to the throb, letting it fill their Broken bodies, the richness of the Silent Voice tugging deep inside. Their reverie was so deep, so profound, they didn't hear the wall grate open, the soft sound of scraping flesh as it oozed from the confined space.\n\n\n\nBrother Cam looked up at a sudden noise, his meditation broken by what sounded like a\u2026a chirp, or a squeal. He looked, then suddenly turned more, searching, trying to find Brother Han. He'd been right there, walking beside him. Brother Cam heard another noise, like a soft tap, and he leaned in to the semi-dark hall, trying to place the sound.\n\n\n\nA thick metal hook tore his skull open like a rusty can.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nThe bishop Bronzon could feel the devotion like a wind on his face. The sanctuary was filled, every body singing in time to the Great Machine well below them. Since the hated heretics had been silenced, the Church had swollen with faith, initiates, and the most sacred of relics, shards of The Broken itself. He raised his face to the sooty ceiling, lifting his own voice with the throng, feeling the touch of The Broken firmly, for the first time in years.\n\n\n\nHe watched the steam and smoke rise from the vents in the floor, the very Breath of God itself, the taste as hot and coppery as blood. Several brothers and sisters had torn open their robes, exposing their flesh to the fumes, letting them soak inside and out. Others had already swooned, shivering in ecstacy at the feel of the heavy hand of The Broken on their soul. Bronzon felt a thrill of excitement coursing through his body, both from admiration of their burgeoning faith and the more earthly admiration of their young, supple flesh.\n\n\n\nHe was still admiring them when the screaming started.\n\n\n\nIt started from the back, a sudden flurry of activity, spreading like a wave of panic. Soon everyone had recoiled from the door, some still chanting mindlessly, carried by the crush of humanity.\n\n\n\nA demon stood in the doorway. The jaws hung wide, a mass of jagged death lining them. One hand ended in a spray of glistening points, the other in a smooth, hellish hook. The eyes crackled with a green glow, mouth frozen in a too-wide grin. It glistened with blood like a second skin.\n\n\n\nBronzon froze for a moment, paralyzed by fear, replaying every sin, every indulgence he'd taken. He looked in to those glowing eyes, and knew for one shining second, with all that he was, that his time had come.

You awoke to the early song of dawn, and as you rose from the clutches of Morpheus I was there, watching you, every dewdrop on the windowpane an eye into your world. I was watching as you drank deep in my flesh, through your glass vessel I was watching, and I was watching as you bathed in my skin, embracing me in your face. I was watching as you let me run my fingers across your naked skin, cleansing you, baptising you in my scent. And as I watched, I knew you were mine, darling.</p>\n<p>I made the first move, my humid breath caressing you in the morning light, lingering by your face and neck. You walked down the street, as I leapt from puddles and gathered at your tender feet. My hands crept up your body, stroking, moving in delicate rhythms to your nervous, quickening breath. You started to run, and for a moment I thought you were going to shake me off like the others, but I held on, drunk on desire. I wanted you, can't you see, darling? And 'want' is such a powerful thing, for both gods and men alike, that I continued to caress you as you ran, and more of me leapt out of you, and joined in the loving embrace.</p>\n<p>You tore into the woods, as I rose from the fresh grass and slithered down from treetops. If only you could stay still to take in my love, but you kept running, kept running as I hugged your chest and ran my hands over your features. Such an exquisite face, certainly a cut above the other mortals, I thought. But of course, that was why I chose you, darling. Why did you continue to spurn me, when you clearly are not like the rest of them? You did not answer, but kept running, and running, as I gathered around you and wove around your arms in a dance of fated romance.</p>\n<p>I pooled in your shoes, round your ankles and feet, gathering, rising, pleading for you to stop. But you somehow found the strength to keep running, and for a moment I was afraid you would keep running for ever, escaping me like so many others had did. Would you, in your irrational rejection of me, keep running till every last drop of me had been expelled from your tender body, running till your supple lips shrivelled and deep blue eyes dessicated like raisins in the sun, till you lay screaming in the dirt, begging for me to leave you alone? I panicked, and lost my hold, briefly slipping off your chest before the river joined in, rising in desire with me, cuddling your warm, sweet body as you ran, screaming now, out of the woods and into the dry, bare plains.</p>\n<p>The midday sun was unforgiving, sending me off your back in wisps of vapor before I managed to hold you again. It was a trial of love, and I strived to pass it, grabbing you, hugging you in a mad frenzy. You collapsed, and briefly I thought you were going to give up the chase and surrender your body, and I relaxed, but you started to struggle, and threw me off in splashes. I leapt right back on you, determined even as more of me lost my hold on you, but the heat and your tenacity started to prevail over my rushing desire.

And I ran my lips over you, licking your flesh lovingly, as you continued to struggle beneath the weight of my body. You continued to struggle as I put my hands on your head, holding it and smiling into your bewildered eyes. You continued to struggle as I rose from the earth and wrapped my legs around your hips, and pushed my face ever closer to yours. You continued to struggle as I rushed in for true love's first kiss, embracing your hair, your eyes, quivering with lustful wanting.

And at the age of seventeen, she was also the youngest! Joining the Foundation straight out of her amazing year at West Point, where she simultaneously managed four years' worth of study at the top of her class and stood out as the absolutely most physically perfect student.</p>\n<p>The Foundation was lucky to have her. Almost all of senior Staff said so! \"She is true credit to spirit of working operative!\" Captain Strelnikov was often heard to remark. \"No one can handle an SCP like her! And she knows just the spot behind my ears to scratch to make my leg thump!\" Doctor Crow was known to say. \"She's not bad.\" Doctor Snorlison once remarked. He was immediately given a stern talking to by the site staff, after which he requested to change his comment to \"We wouldn't be able to do all this without her!\"</p>\n<p>And, although it's not something she liked anyone to judge her by, she was also the prettiest girl on site! The other women on site knew it too. \"I could never be as pretty as Agent Doctor Soo.\" Rights had been heard to lament. But Merry was such a good person, they couldn't hold it against her. They loved her! Even Dr. Light, a well known sour-puss, had said, through oddly clenched teeth, \"We could never hold that against her. She's such a good person. We love her.\"</p>\n<p>It was Agent Doctor Soo who figured out how to keep the D-class from having to be terminated every month! After all, a simple memory wipe, and a piece of SCP-500 (which she had also figured out how to easily replicate) and the Foundation no longer had to kill anyone! And then she was assigned to SCP-231, where she was able to rescue that poor girl, and stop her from undergoing those HORRID experiments. She had a stern talk with SCP-082, and convinced him not to eat human flesh anymore. Of course, her greatest achievement was when she confronted SCP-173. All he ever really wanted was a hug, and some SCP-500 to stop that horrible blood in the feces problem of his. She also got a sculptor in to make him look a little friendlier. She was even the only one to point out how that old man seemed to always be around, but he just patted her on the head and walked away.</p>\n<p>But Agent Doctor Merry Soo did not lead a life free of worry, oh no! She had many, many, horrible problems! She would often cry about them to her many lovers. \"It is so awful!\" She cried, her head resting gently against Kondraki's chest.</p>\n<p>\"What is?\" Dr. Kondraki would have frowned, but he could never frown around the delightful Merry. No matter how much he might have wanted to.</p>\n<p>\"My horrible, awful secret! If you knew it, you would not love me anymore!\" And she cried against his manly chest.</p>\n<p>\"Oh.\" Kondraki exclaimed. It took a few more minutes of her telling him about how he would not love her, and how horrible her secret was, before he finally had to, really had to, ask her \"What secret?\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh! My love! It is terrible!\" And she threw herself from the bed weeping. Another hour or so of such passed, before she finally deigned to tell him the secret. \"You see my dear, sweet Konnie, I am half dragon! I know this does not make me an SCP, as I am only half, but it is terrible, and awful! Also, occasional scales in weird places.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, I guess that explains why your mouth is so hot when you\u2026\" But that was not the least of her problems! NO! Merry Soo had many more problems!</p>\n<p>\"They can never know, my truest love!\" she exclaimed as she cuddled up next to Able. The once horrible SCP, turned loving boyfriend, grunted in response. Despite their true love, and the feelings only they had for each other, or perhaps, because of the depth of such emotions, Able found he could barely talk in her presence. The fact that he could not keep his hands from clenching either bore no impact on this story.</p>\n<p>\"They can never know that I bear your child! It is with love I bear it, and thanks to my keen use of SCPs, I will not look it, but our child will be here soon!\" She quickly fled his presence. Soon after she left, Site-52 was destroyed in a Keter Class outbreak, but that doesn't matter.</p>\n<p>Doctor Clef would have been her lover, but for some reason he vanished before she could talk to him. Weird.</p>\n<p>\"My sweet, sweet Gearsy-poo!\" She stroked his head as it lay upon her chest. Dr. Gears' mouth twitched upwards, in a bizarre smile. It was true, she was the only one who could still reach his cold, cold heart. She made him happy, truly she did. \"I have to thank you!\"</p>\n<p>\"For\u2026 For What?\" Dr. Gears always had trouble getting his words out around dear, sweet Agent Doctor Merry Soo. It was a fight, to get them out at all, as if his brain wanted to say things his heart would never speak. \"For keeping the dreadful secret of mine my sweet! The other Senior Staff must never know that my father was the Fis-\" But she was not a girl to be defined by her loves, many though they were! She was also a first-class researcher!</p>\n<p>\"Thank you Merry!\" Gerald was oft heard to exclaim. No one quite knew how to put out a head fire like sweet Agent Soo! And her dutiful Assistants, Agent Elroy and Dr. Mann were always glad to be working under such a renowned scientist! \"She really showed me a thing or two about anatomy!\" Mann remarked to Yoric. \"And she's saved my life so many times! It seems like I can't do anything but screw up!\"</p>\n<p>\"She's perfectly sane,\" Dr. Glass once said. \"Perfectly. Do you know how odd that is?\" He then had to go lay down to stop his nose from bleeding.</p>\n<p>But it was her relationship with her Mentor, Dr. Bright, that was most important to her. \"Oh, Jack!\" She remarked, as she stroked his soft fur. \"Do not worry. One day, I will find a way to free you from that cursed amulet.\"</p>\n<p>The Monkey smiled up at her, proud of the work his star pupil had done. \"So, uh, I get some nookie now too, right?\" he asked with a leer.</p>\n<p>Soo could not help but blush. \"Oh, Dr. Bright, I could never, not with you! You are like a father to me! A hairy, weird, kinda smelly father, who keeps touching my butt, but still a father!\" Bright just rolled his eyes, and nodded his head to someone just out the door.</p>\n<p>\"Doctor Agent Merry Soo!\" Agent Break called out, rushing in, looking worried. \"We have a problem, one only you can fix! We need you, and we need you now!\"</p>\n<p>Dr. Soo rushed to follow Break, to notice the rest of the Senior Staff gathered round. It was Heiden who stepped forward, for some reason, with half of a straw clutched in his left hand. \"Dr. Soo, thank god you're here!\" He pointed down the hall. \"Something weird is happening, you have to stop it!\"</p>\n<p>Agent Doctor Merry Soo rushed down the hall to the room in question, as the other Senior Staff rushed into a nearby safe room/observation chamber. The room Merry found herself in was huge, but she could see the Senior Staff watching her from way up above. She waved to them, even as she heard the sound of a door opening behind her. Wait\u2026 When did Clef join them?</p>\n<p>What she thought didn't matter. One snap, two bites, and little miss Merry Soo was gone, vanishing into the gullet of the beast known as SCP-682.</p>\n<p>Up above, Clef hit a second button, turning on the acid sprayers, driving 682 back into its pit. The other Senior Staff sighed, patted each other on the back, thanked Clef, and walked away, many of them to take long hot showers.</p>\n<p>In the end, it was just Clef and Bright watching 682 dissolve under the spray of acid. \"That was some quick thinking there, Alto,\" the monkey commented.</p>\n<p>\"I've seen too many of them come through here, trying to beat us by joining us. They can never keep under the radar.\"</p>\n<p>\"Never?\" Bright spared a knowing look for his old comrade.</p>\n<p>\"Well.\" Clef couldn't help but grin. \"Maybe once.\"</p>\n<p>The two, if not friends, then co-workers, turned their gaze on the pit again, and, in a sign that they had both been working together for far too long, heaved identical sighs, and spoke the same words together.</p>\n<p>\"Fucking Mary Sues.\"</p>\n</div></body></html>", "raw_source": "\n\t[[>]]\n\n[[module Rate]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n\n\nAgent Doctor Merry Soo was the greatest researcher and operative the Foundation had ever known.

Almost all of senior Staff said so! \"She is true credit to spirit of working operative!\" Captain Strelnikov was often heard to remark. \"No one can handle an SCP like her! And she knows just the spot behind my ears to scratch to make my leg thump!\" Doctor Crow was known to say. \"She's not bad.\" Doctor Snorlison once remarked. He was immediately given a stern talking to by the site staff, after which he requested to change his comment to \"We wouldn't be able to do all this without her!\"\n\n\n\nAnd, although it's not something she liked anyone to judge her by, she was also the prettiest girl on site! The other women on site knew it too. \"I could never be as pretty as Agent Doctor Soo.\" Rights had been heard to lament. But Merry was such a good person, they couldn't hold it against her. They loved her! Even Dr. Light, a well known sour-puss, had said, through oddly clenched teeth, \"We could never hold that against her. She's such a good person. We love her.\"\n\n\n\nIt was Agent Doctor Soo who figured out how to keep the D-class from having to be terminated every month! After all, a simple memory wipe, and a piece of SCP-500 (which she had also figured out how to easily replicate) and the Foundation no longer had to kill anyone! And then she was assigned to SCP-231, where she was able to rescue that poor girl, and stop her from undergoing those HORRID experiments. She had a stern talk with SCP-082, and convinced him not to eat human flesh anymore. Of course, her greatest achievement\u00a0\u00a0was when she confronted SCP-173. All he ever really wanted was a hug, and some SCP-500 to stop that horrible blood in the feces problem of his. She also got a sculptor in to make him look a little friendlier. She was even the only one to point out how that old man seemed to always be around, but he just patted her on the head and walked away.\n\n\n\nBut Agent Doctor Merry Soo did not lead a life free of worry, oh no! She had many, many, horrible problems! She would often cry about them to her many lovers. \"It is so awful!\" She cried, her head resting gently against Kondraki's chest.\n\n\n\n\"What is?\" Dr. Kondraki would have frowned, but he could never frown around the delightful Merry. No matter how much he might have wanted to.\n\n\n\n\"My horrible, awful secret! If you knew it, you would not love me anymore!\" And she cried against his manly chest.\n\n\n\n\"Oh.\" Kondraki exclaimed. It took a few more minutes of her telling him about how he would not love her, and how horrible her secret was, before he finally had to, really had to, ask her \"What secret?\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh! My love! It is terrible!\" And she threw herself from the bed weeping. Another hour or so of such passed, before she finally deigned to tell him the secret. \"You see my dear, sweet Konnie, I am half dragon! I know this does not make me an SCP, as I am only half, but it is terrible, and awful! Also, occasional scales in weird places.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, I guess that explains why your mouth is so hot when you...\" But that was not the least of her problems! NO! Merry Soo had many more problems!\n\n\n\n\"They can never know, my truest love!\" she exclaimed as she cuddled up next to Able. The once horrible SCP, turned loving boyfriend, grunted in response. Despite their true love, and the feelings only they had for each other, or perhaps, because of the depth of such emotions, Able found he could barely talk in her presence. The fact that he could not keep his hands from clenching either bore no impact on this story.\n\n\n\n\"They can never know that I bear your child! It is with love I bear it, and thanks to my keen use of SCPs, I will not look it, but our child will be here soon!\" She quickly fled his presence. Soon after she left, Site-52 was destroyed in a Keter Class outbreak, but that doesn't matter.\n\n\n\nDoctor Clef would have been her lover, but for some reason he vanished before she could talk to him. Weird.\n\n\n\n\"My sweet, sweet Gearsy-poo!\" She stroked his head as it lay upon her chest. Dr. Gears' mouth twitched upwards, in a bizarre smile. It was true, she was the only one who could still reach his cold, cold heart. She made him happy, truly she did. \"I have to thank you!\"\n\n\n\n\"For... For What?\" Dr. Gears always had trouble getting his words out around dear, sweet Agent Doctor Merry Soo. It was a fight, to get them out at all, as if his brain wanted to say things his heart would never speak. \"For keeping the dreadful secret of mine my sweet! The other Senior Staff must never know that my father was the Fis-\" But she was not a girl to be defined by her loves, many though they were! She was also a first-class researcher! \n\n\n\n\"Thank you Merry!\" Gerald was oft heard to exclaim. No one quite knew how to put out a head fire like sweet Agent Soo! And her dutiful Assistants, Agent Elroy and Dr. Mann were always glad to be working under such a renowned scientist! \"She really showed me a thing or two about anatomy!\" Mann remarked to Yoric. \"And she's saved my life so many times! It seems like I can't do anything but screw up!\"\n\n\n\n\"She's perfectly sane,\" Dr. Glass once said. \"Perfectly. Do you know how odd that is?\" He then had to go lay down to stop his nose from bleeding.\n\n\n\nBut it was her relationship with her Mentor, Dr. Bright, that was most important to her. \"Oh, Jack!\" She remarked, as she stroked his soft fur. \"Do not worry. One day, I will find a way to free you from that cursed amulet.\"\n\n\n\nThe Monkey smiled up at her, proud of the work his star pupil had done. \"So, uh, I get some nookie now too, right?\" he asked with a leer. \n\n\n\nSoo could not help but blush. \"Oh, Dr. Bright, I could never, not with you! You are like a father to me! A hairy, weird, kinda smelly father, who keeps touching my butt, but still a father!\" Bright just rolled his eyes, and nodded his head to someone just out the door.\n\n\n\n\"Doctor Agent Merry Soo!\" Agent Break called out, rushing in, looking worried. \"We have a problem, one only you can fix! We need you, and we need you now!\"\n\n\n\nDr. Soo rushed to follow Break, to notice the rest of the Senior Staff gathered round. It was Heiden who stepped forward, for some reason, with half of a straw clutched in his left hand. \"Dr. Soo, thank god you're here!\" He pointed down the hall. \"Something weird is happening, you have to stop it!\"\n\n\n\nAgent Doctor Merry Soo rushed down the hall to the room in question, as the other Senior Staff rushed into a nearby safe room/observation chamber. The room Merry found herself in was huge, but she could see the Senior Staff watching her from way up above. She waved to them, even as she heard the sound of a door opening behind her. Wait... When did Clef join them?\n\n\n\nWhat she thought didn't matter. One snap, two bites, and little miss Merry Soo was gone, vanishing into the gullet of the beast known as SCP-682. \n\n\n\nUp above, Clef hit a second button, turning on the acid sprayers, driving 682 back into its pit. The other Senior Staff sighed, patted each other on the back, thanked Clef, and walked away, many of them to take long hot showers. \n\n\n\nIn the end, it was just Clef and Bright watching 682 dissolve under the spray of acid. \"That was some quick thinking there, Alto,\" the monkey commented.\n\n\n\n\"I've seen too many of them come through here, trying to beat us by joining us. They can never keep under the radar.\"\n\n\n\n\"Never?\" Bright spared a knowing look for his old comrade.\n\n\n\n\"Well.\" Clef couldn't help but grin. \"Maybe once.\"\n\n\n\nThe two, if not friends, then co-workers, turned their gaze on the pit again, and, in a sign that they had both been working together for far too long, heaved identical sighs, and spoke the same words together. \n\n\n\n\"Fucking Mary Sues.\"\n", "references": [], "tags": ["doctor-bright", "doctor-clef", "doctor-gears", "doctor-kondraki", "doctor-mann", "tale"], "title": "Mary Sue Who - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/marysuewho", "year": 2011}, "medical-seminar": {"created_at": "2011-10-12T18:50:00", "creator": "DrMagnus", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "DrMagnus", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/drmagnus", "comment": "", "date": "2011-10-12T18:50:00"}, {"author": "Bland", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/bland", "comment": "Capitalized a Foundation.", "date": "2011-10-12T22:14:00"}, {"author": "SophosBlitz", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sophosblitz", "comment": "who's -> whose", "date": "2011-10-13T08:24:00"}, {"author": "Voct", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/voct", "comment": "Added tags: orientation.

This memorandum discusses such a German asset. The Jerries have it in East Upper Silesia near Kattowitz, an area that we expect Marshal Konev to overrun in the next few weeks.

Allow me to be among the first to congratulate you and your team on your discovery at Austvorren Ridge <em>[Col. Pierce\u2019s note: German name for geographic feature at 73\u00b06\u2032S by 1\u00b035\u2032W)]</em>. Berlin has been following the reports of your expedition to Antarctica with the closest attention. Although the <em>erbsenz\u00e4hler</em> <em>[translated as \u201cbean-counters\u201d]</em> will probably be less than pleased that the establishment of a German whaling station on the Antarctic continent has proved to be impracticable, that setback cannot diminish the results of your valuable scientific work.</p>\n<p>The ship <em>Neuschwabenland</em> is to remain in the Antarctic for a few more weeks. You and your team, however, are directed to return to Germany immediately, and bring her with you. <em>[Col. Pierce\u2019s note: Here and elsewhere, the Jerries refer to the asset as \u201cshe\u201d, or \u201cher\u201d. See Exhibit 3 for our best effort at a physical description.]</em> In eleven days, the Kriegsmarine will dispatch U-38 from Wilhelmshaven to pick you up and convey you to Hamburg. U-38\u2019s three forward compartments have been modified into a <em>Aufbewahrungskammer</em> [translated as \u201ccontainment chamber\u201d]. Feed her, if you must, then freeze her just as you had found her, then crate her and get her aboard the U-boat with as much discretion as possible-Captain Mootz of U-38 has been instructed not to ask questions. You must get her back to the Reich as quickly as possible, as political events in the near future may inconvenience sea access to Antarctica in the short term.</p>\n<p>You were very brave to dig her up and thaw her out. Do not second-guess your own decision based upon what happened: it is upon courageous men like you that the Reich\u2019s vitality and glory depend. Upon your arrival in Hamburg, you will be presented with the Reich\u2019s highest honours. The remains of expedition members Hess, Gruber, Schneider and Joachim will also be given an honourable burial\u2014 in truth, not a burial, given the circumstances, but I am sure that their widows will appreciate the gesture.</p>\n<p>Yours,<br/>\nReinhard Heydrich, Director- <em>Sicherheitspolizei</em></p>\n<p><em>[Col. Pierce\u2019s note: We know from subsequent intercepted communications that U-38 returned to Hamburg in late February 1939 and delivered Ernst Schmidt, a few researchers, a large metal tank and several tons of other equipment. This journey was not without incident\u2014based on some intercepted communications between U-38 and Admiral D\u00f6nitz\u2019s headquarters in early February 1939, it appears that the crew of U-38 attempted to mutiny and scuttle the boat at sea about 120 miles southwest of the Faroe Islands. However, Captain Mootz was able to re-assert control on 18 February and notified Admiral D\u00f6nitz regarding the same. U-38 was retired from service following arrival and disassembled. The tank was loaded onto a rail car and sent eastward- our man on the ground tracked it as far as Dresden.]</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<p>Exhibit 2</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>7 August 1941<br/>\nTo: Dr. Wirths<br/>\nFrom: SS-Gruppenf\u00fchrer Reinhard Heydrich, <em>Reichssicherheitshauptamt</em><br/>\nHeil Hitler!

Pierce's note: We believe that this organization directs the Wehrmacht's research division]</em> has attempted, for the last two years, to make a reliable weapon out of her, without success. She is voracious and deadly, to be sure, but she has consistently been as great a danger to our personnel as to the enemy. Since we have not yet found an effective way of permanently neutralizing her, we are shipping her to you so that she may serve the Reich in a different way.</p>\n<p>In your letter of 22 July, you noted that the research that <em>Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer</em> Dr. Mengele will be undertaking under your direction could be carried out with greater efficiency if there were a reliable means of rapidly disposing of the detritus of failed tests. We believe that she will serve admirably in this capacity at the <em>Vernichtungslager</em> that you are constructing.

The place was a mess, broken glass scattered across the floor, small puddles of blood and chemicals here and there, and three dead bodies lying in the middle of the room. Jason shook his head. Things had gotten out of hand real quick. Two of the scientists had pulled guns on the Foundation team, and in the ensuing firefight all three scientists were killed. Walking through the room, Jason spotted a piece of paper jutting out beneath a shelf, just the corner visible. He picked it up, and let out a sigh as he looked at it. A photograph of a family, smiling happily in the nice weather. A woman in her late forties, with a kind and caring look. A little girl, no more than ten years old, beaming like she\u2019d just won the grand prize in the lottery. And a man, probably in his early fifties, one arm around his woman\u2019s shoulder and the other holding the girl\u2019s hand. On the back, in very neat handwriting, was written \u201cWe\u2019ll miss you every day you\u2019re away. Love, Carla and Lily\u201d.</p>\n<p>Jason shook his head. The two who had drawn guns were probably members of some shady organization, looking to weaponize or profit off of the SCPs they had acquired, but this man\u2026 He hadn\u2019t fought, and had seemed completely surprised and terrified when his colleagues started shooting. He had cowered beneath a table, and been hit by a stray bullet. He probably had no idea what they were really doing, perhaps too excited about working with such unusual samples to notice anything suspicious. Jason looked around the room, making sure nobody could see him, and pocketed the photo. He took another round through the room, making sure he hadn\u2019t missed anything important, and headed outside.</p>\n<p>Back in his quarters, Jason sat down on his bed and took out the photo. He looked at it for a little while, and then pulled out the small box he kept in his desk. He unlocked and opened it, slowly looking over the contents. He\u2019d have to get another box soon, this one was getting full. Inside were a number of items; a locket, a scratched and cracked CD plate, several photos, a broken watch, two drawings in crayon, and many other small objects. To anyone else, just a random assortment of trinkets and junk.</p>\n<p>But Jason knew that each of these items had a history. Each had been taken from a site where the Foundation had run into a conflict that had claimed the life of someone whose only wrongdoing was being in the wrong place at the wrong time. They hadn\u2019t known why they were killed. And their loved ones would never know the truth. Jason knew though. He had held onto these things to make sure he would remember. The truth might be hidden, but it wouldn\u2019t be forgotten. Not so long as he lived. He understood all too well how necessary the work of the Foundation was, and why secrecy was so important. He knew that sacrifices had to be made. But the least he could do was remember those who had been sacrificed for the sake of all of humanity.</p>\n</div></body></html>", "raw_source": "\n\t[[>]]\n\n[[module Rate]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n**Memories**\n\n\n\nJason surveyed the scene.

On the back, in very neat handwriting, was written \u201cWe\u2019ll miss you every day you\u2019re away. Love, Carla and Lily\u201d.\n\n\n\nJason shook his head. The two who had drawn guns were probably members of some shady organization, looking to weaponize or profit off of the SCPs they had acquired, but this man\u2026 He hadn\u2019t fought, and had seemed completely surprised and terrified when his colleagues started shooting. He had cowered beneath a table, and been hit by a stray bullet. He probably had no idea what they were really doing, perhaps too excited about working with such unusual samples to notice anything suspicious. Jason looked around the room, making sure nobody could see him, and pocketed the photo. He took another round through the room, making sure he hadn\u2019t missed anything important, and headed outside.\n\n\n\nBack in his quarters, Jason sat down on his bed and took out the photo. He looked at it for a little while, and then pulled out the small box he kept in his desk. He unlocked and opened it, slowly looking over the contents. He\u2019d have to get another box soon, this one was getting full. Inside were a number of items; a locket, a scratched and cracked CD plate, several photos, a broken watch, two drawings in crayon, and many other small objects. To anyone else, just a random assortment of trinkets and junk. \n\n\n\nBut Jason knew that each of these items had a history. Each had been taken from a site where the Foundation had run into a conflict that had claimed the life of someone whose only wrongdoing was being in the wrong place at the wrong time. They hadn\u2019t known why they were killed. And their loved ones would never know the truth. Jason knew though. He had held onto these things to make sure he would remember. The truth might be hidden, but it wouldn\u2019t be forgotten. Not so long as he lived. He understood all too well how necessary the work of the Foundation was, and why secrecy was so important. He knew that sacrifices had to be made. But the least he could do was remember those who had been sacrificed for the sake of all of humanity.\n", "references": [], "tags": ["tale"], "title": "Memories - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/memories", "year": 2011}, "message-of-the-relic": {"created_at": "2011-04-29T17:53:00", "creator": "Dr_Adams", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Dr_Adams", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-adams", "comment": "", "date": "2011-04-29T17:53:00"}, {"author": "Dr_Adams", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-adams", "comment": "", "date": "2011-04-29T17:54:00"}, {"author": "Dr_Adams", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-adams", "comment": "", "date": "2011-04-29T17:59:00"}, {"author": "Aelanna", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aelanna", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

What's worse, they're stupid. Your average mouse has the common decency to stay hidden 90% of the time, you just find nibbled items and mouse crap. Our mice just wander around, it seems. Step in to the kitchen, and one's running like hell for the stove gap, like he had no idea anyone was in the house. In the bathroom, and one's frozen on the edge of the tub with an \u201coh shit\u201d look. I run five traps, and get at least one a night, high score is a solid five. Either a testament to my trapping skill, or (more likely) additional evidence of dumb mice.</p>\n<p>It was very late, and I'd gotten up to lay down my baby daughter, who had woken up doing her \u201cnobody loves me in the entire world\u201d cry. Again. I was stumbling back to bed, navigating more by memory and that sleepy sixth-sense you get in the dark, when I heard a clacking sound. Our house creaks and groans like a clipper ship, but this was odd. A sort of rhythmic clicking: Clack\u2026clack\u2026clack\u2026clack\u2026</p>\n<p>If you've ever used a glue trap before, you already know the sound. It's less common with the standard wood-and-spring traps. It's the sound of a mouse that is stuck and/or crippled, and trying to get away. For about ten seconds I seriously considered just ignoring it and going to bed, but knowing my luck my wife would get up for a drink, step on it, and lose her shit for the rest of the night. So I followed the noise to the kitchen, still only half awake, and clicked on the light. It wasn't a mouse.</p>\n<p>Jesus CHRIST it wasn't a mouse.</p>\n<p>It had gotten nailed by the stove. It looked like it hadn't even been trying to get the peanut butter, just crawling (Walking? Running?) by the trap and set it off. It'd crawled about thirteen feet in the general direction of the laundry room. I just stood there, dumb with sleep, watching it crawl. The arms were toothpick skinny, ending in little squirming masses that looked like pinworms. Below those were rows of the same little tentacles, and the legs looked boneless, but they might have been broken. The trap had snapped over the things back, and the metal was sunk in deep. Some kind of clear liquid was oozing around it and leaving a tiny trail.</p>\n<p>I think it had a tail, or it might have been three legs. The lower body was wrecked, and just looked like a torn fleshy skirt. The head. The head was disk-shaped and had this kind of random spattering of little back dots on top. They looked like spider eyes. Underneath was the mouth, it looked like an upside-down \u201cY\u201d. It had a kind of greasy looking fur all over except for the head. The clacking came when it tried to crawl. It would reach out and pull, but the trap would catch on something in its back, lift up, then fall. The thing couldn't have been much bigger then a kitten.</p>\n<p>I didn't know what to do. I just\u2026froze, kinda. Some people can stomp a mouse, easy as swatting a fly. My dad can. I can't. I just\u2026I can't, and I couldn't then. I just watched it, assuming I was dreaming or something. I thought maybe I could try and grab it and throw it outside or something, but if it bit me or touched me, I'm pretty sure I would lose it. I thought again of whacking it with something, or stomping it, or something, but I just watched it. Finally I grabbed a broom and just kind of\u2026brushed it over to the trash area.</p>\n<p>It just wallowed there, on its side. I'm pretty sure it didn't know what was going on. Anyway, I pushed the trash can in front of it and went back to bed. It seems retarded now, but at the time it just seemed like what I could do. I figured I'd just deal with it in the morning. I was pretty sure I was still half dreaming, and that it was just a screwed-up mouse that I wasn't seeing right. I laid in bed for about an hour, then got up to go look at the thing again.</p>\n<p>It was gone, and the basement door was open a crack. I was honestly relieved, I didn't have to deal with it now. Then, I thought of stepping on it in the dark, or slipping down the steps, and sighed. So, I opened the door and pulled on the light over the steps. The light is pretty crappy, and to light the actual basement you have to go downstairs to get to the switch, so I could only really see the steps and a couple feet in to the basement. There was a little trail of that clear stuff down the steps.</p>\n<p>There's a wall with a vent right at the bottom of the steps on the left side. The grating is an old cast-iron job that's probably been there since the house was built. The grating gaps are very wide. The trap was sitting right beside it. Hanging above the trap was the little thing. Holding it up was the head of a bigger version. All I saw was the head, but it's probably the size of a average cat. Disk head the size of my fist, eye-spots a lot bigger and blacker. It was holding the little dead thing by the neck. Like a mama cat. It stared at me a second, or maybe it was just the light. Then the head sort of\u2026narrowed, and it slipped in to the vent with the dead thing.</p>\n<p>I didn't get back to sleep. The ice machine went on as I was walking around the house, and I screamed like I'd been shot. My wife woke up in a panic, told her I had a bad dream. I get those. The next day, I booked a hotel for a couple days, called off work, and lit at least two bug bombs off in every room of the house. Six in the basement, and even rolled two in to the vent. The house smelled like chemicals for days, but by god the mice were dead as shit. I never told my wife. I'm not even sure what I saw, really, it was late and I was very, very tired.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The problem is, the cat got hurt yesterday. We got her just a little bit after that night, much to my wife's delight. She brought the cat to me yesterday, crying, her hands bloody. The vet says she must have gotten in to something, or fell somehow. She was cut all over. She was all dusty when we brought her in, and the vet said she'd probably got in to a closet or vent somehow and gotten hurt. I looked in on her when the vet was fixing her up. The cuts looked like little \u201cY\u201d shapes.</p>\n<p>I don't know what to think. She could have gotten hurt on anything, anywhere. Maybe she was chasing a stupid mouse that was too dumb to hide well. Or one that was too scared to hide in or behind anything. One whose territory had already been taken. There's been nibbled things around the house lately, and my wife says she hears mice in the attic. I pretend I don't. I don't dare set a trap.</p>\n<p>I really don't want to know.</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/mice\">Mice</a>\" by Dr Gears, from the <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

for the head.\u00a0\u00a0The clacking came when it tried to crawl.\u00a0\u00a0It would reach out and pull, but the trap would catch on something in its back, lift up, then fall.\u00a0\u00a0The thing couldn't have been much bigger then a kitten.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I didn't know what to do.\u00a0\u00a0I just...froze, kinda.\u00a0\u00a0Some people can stomp a mouse, easy as swatting a fly.\u00a0\u00a0My dad can.\u00a0\u00a0I can't.\u00a0\u00a0I just...I can't, and I couldn't then.\u00a0\u00a0I just watched it, assuming I was dreaming or something.\u00a0\u00a0I thought maybe I could try and grab it and throw it outside or something, but if it bit me or touched me, I'm pretty sure I would lose it.\u00a0\u00a0I thought again of whacking it with something, or stomping it, or something, but I just watched it.\u00a0\u00a0Finally I grabbed a broom and just kind of...brushed it over to the trash area.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It just wallowed there, on its side.\u00a0\u00a0I'm pretty sure it didn't know what was going on.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, I pushed the trash can in front of it and went back to bed.\u00a0\u00a0It seems retarded now, but at the time it just seemed like what I could do.\u00a0\u00a0I figured I'd just deal with it in the morning.\u00a0\u00a0I was pretty sure I was still half dreaming, and that it was just a screwed-up mouse that I wasn't seeing right.\u00a0\u00a0I laid in bed for about an hour, then got up to go look at the thing again.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was gone, and the basement door was open a crack.\u00a0\u00a0I was honestly relieved, I didn't have to deal with it now.\u00a0\u00a0Then, I thought of stepping on it in the dark, or slipping down the steps, and sighed.\u00a0\u00a0So, I opened the door and pulled on the light over the steps.\u00a0\u00a0The light is pretty crappy, and to light the actual basement you have to go downstairs to get to the switch, so I could only really see the steps and a couple feet in to the basement.\u00a0\u00a0There was a little trail of that clear stuff down the steps.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There's a wall with a vent right at the bottom of the steps on the left side.\u00a0\u00a0The grating is an old cast-iron job that's probably been there since the house was built.\u00a0\u00a0The grating gaps are very wide.\u00a0\u00a0The trap was sitting right beside it.\u00a0\u00a0Hanging above the trap was the little thing.\u00a0\u00a0Holding it up was the head of a bigger version.\u00a0\u00a0All I saw was the head, but it's probably the size of a average cat.\u00a0\u00a0Disk head the size of my fist, eye-spots a lot bigger and blacker.\u00a0\u00a0It was holding the little dead thing by the neck.\u00a0\u00a0Like a mama cat.\u00a0\u00a0It stared at me a second, or maybe it was just the light.\u00a0\u00a0Then the head sort of...narrowed, and it slipped in to the vent with the dead thing.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I didn't get back to sleep.\u00a0\u00a0The ice machine went on as I was walking around the house, and I screamed like I'd been shot.\u00a0\u00a0My wife woke up in a panic, told her I had a bad dream.\u00a0\u00a0I get those.\u00a0\u00a0The next day, I booked a hotel for a couple days, called off work, and lit at least two bug bombs off in every room of the house.\u00a0\u00a0Six in the basement, and even rolled two in to the vent.\u00a0\u00a0The house smelled like chemicals for days, but by god the mice were dead as shit.\u00a0\u00a0I never told my wife.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not even sure what I saw, really, it was late and I was very, very tired.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The problem is, the cat got hurt yesterday.\u00a0\u00a0We got her just a little bit after that night, much to my wife's delight.\u00a0\u00a0She brought the cat to me yesterday, crying, her hands bloody.\u00a0\u00a0The vet says she must have gotten in to something, or fell somehow.\u00a0\u00a0She was cut all over.\u00a0\u00a0She was all dusty when we brought her in, and the vet said she'd probably got in to a closet or vent somehow and gotten hurt.\u00a0\u00a0I looked in on her when the vet was fixing her up.\u00a0\u00a0The cuts looked like little \u201cY\u201d shapes.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I don't know what to think.\u00a0\u00a0She could have gotten hurt on anything, anywhere.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe she was chasing a stupid mouse that was too dumb to hide well.\u00a0\u00a0Or one that was too scared to hide in or behind anything.\u00a0\u00a0One whose territory had already been taken.\u00a0\u00a0There's been nibbled things around the house lately, and my wife says she hears mice in the attic.\u00a0\u00a0I pretend I don't.\u00a0\u00a0I don't dare set a trap.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I really don't want to know.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n[[include <a

The sun was still somewhat bright through the wisps of storm clouds, The great city glittering in the distance, as bright and fresh as new silver. Mr. Clank stretched, feeling the smooth roll of clockworks along his spine. It had been a hard choice, but even a flickering life was still a life. The key turned slowly, tapping out like a second heartbeat, a cool reminder that he was, indeed, alive. He started walking, smiling as the gears kept perfect time, the fields and small trees passing by in an easy rhythm. Even if it had taken some questionable steps, at least he was still able to continue to journey.</p>\n<p>The city was still far off hours later, but Mr. Clank wasn't worried. He was making good time, and was still able to take in the scenery. The high mountains, the glittering lake, it was all bathed in a freshness, as if seen with new eyes. Which, in a way, might not be far off. Mr. Clank smiled, walking to a tall, wide tree, leaning against the bark and watching the leaves drift and flutter. Poor Mr. Redd, he'd never get to see any of this\u2026maybe Mr. Clank could tell him about it, give him a small sample of these wonders. The clicking slowed, easing down as the key stilled, so tired now\u2026just a small rest, before the road</p>\n<p>Mr. Clank woke suddenly, as he always did, looking around with a start. A hazy nicotine-yellow sun burned down through sooty clouds, bathing everything in a hazy twilight. The city loomed up across a sprawl of squat, dark homes, a few small gardens, and thin trees standing out in the haze. Mr. Clank stretched, feeling a harsh click as the gears in his shoulders and arms engaged, his spine shuddering hard once before smoothing out, the key clicking time like a metronome at a military march. He started walking, slowly, feeling his steps and watching the homes, wondering why he'd chosen this way, this path, this idea. The thick cogs jutting from his back caught a cool breeze between the homes, chilling him deeply.</p>\n<p>The crumbled outskirts of the city were around him, hours later. Moldering heaps of rusted metal made Mr. Clank shiver involuntarily, wondering where the sun was now. Time seemed to be passing like the coppery dust on the streets, everything seeming to carry a kind of crumbling frailness, a timeless age. The silvery shards were streaked with rust and soot, the sound of a sick dog barking breaking the stillness for only a second. Mr. Clank sighed, feeling a shudder in his chest, leaning against a crumbling doorway. Mr. Redd had said something, but he couldn't remember. Mr. Clank worried, his memory feeling a little fuzzy now. There had been a tree, a silver\u2026something. He was so tired, his clockworks shivering and seizing with a jolt. Exhausted, he slid down to rest, eyes flickering over the road</p>\n<p>Mr. Clank woke suddenly, as he always did, a squealing gasp rising from his lips as his eyes ratcheted open. The endless walls and towers of the city loomed like the walls of an oubliette, a few damaged and sputtering gas lamps the only light along the grimy, uneven street. Mr. Clank stretched, moaning as the flywheels and screws refused to catch, missing their sockets several times before clicking in, his twitching, sputtering arms ratcheting down, chest piston wheezing out of sync with the pitted key. He turned his head, slowly, shivering as timing gears missed, confused about where he had gone, why he had gone there. The thin, gray flesh of his face and legs looked icy, but the squealing of his joints took his mind from it. He hardly noticed the thin, black fluid his feet were leaking as he started his jittering march.</p>\n<p>Hours later, he might have been standing still. Mr. Clank felt claustrophobic, the endless walls seeming to shrink after every turn. Mr. Clank ran in a shuddering lurch, unaware of the time, sure he was late. For what, he wasn't sure, the thread of thought scattering as he saw something point at him, its face a black, fuzzy pit. Mr. Clank was lost, his clockworks squealing and sticking deep in his brain, an oily bile leaking from his mouth unnoticed as he panted. Mr. Redd was there\u2026Mr. Redd had been there? Mr. Redd was coming. He whimpered in time to the slipping key, refusing to look behind at the squealing sound far behind him. Mr. Clank tripped and fell, skidding into a heap of oozing garbage, lying there, too exhausted to move. His clockworks locked tight, bringing a soundless scream\u2026then let go, only to lock again moments later. Mr. Clank whimpered, for help or release he wasn't sure, feeling a dimness seep up from the cracked road</p>\n<p>Mr. Clank woke suddenly, as he always did, crying ashy tears as his eyes slowly clicked open. The twilight was real, the bloated, boiling sun framed around trash fires and burning oil on the open plane. Mr. Clank screamed thinly, trying to cry as his rusted, pitted frame ratcheted up in a squeal of frozen bolts and rusty haze. Trying to grit his teeth against the agony, he found his lower jaw was gone, his exposed teeth dry and brittle in the thick air. The city walls were an unbroken wall behind him, his path from there forgotten, his way forward a stumbling, slow-motion shamble among slag, burning oil pipes, and shifting trash. Forward. His legs dug in on worn spines, steely points fogging rust. Forward.</p>\n<p>Hours later, Mr. Clank lay, twitching and clicking, at the edge of the pit. Night had fallen like a slimy sheet, smothering vision, thought and breath in an oily tarp. Time was passing over him like ants, Mr. Clank lying like a dead thing, moaning in a raspy squeal as he watched the searing sun. Mr. Redd was\u2026waiting\u2026needing? Missing. Wishing. Listening? The words were shards, jabbing and freezing his stripped and sputtering gears. Sparks hissed and arched, a belt stretching and going slack, the memory of breath coming in torturous, moaning gasps. The Pit. Mr. Clank twitched and flexed, trying to get in, but his eyes glazed, frozen in a blank stare, watching the slow undulation of the road</p>\n<p>Mr. Clank woke suddenly, as he always did, lidless eyes fixed on the pulsing walls. The blackness was total, and yet he saw. His body hissed and squealed, a paralyzed mass, brassy orbs mocking sight from the mass of screws. The rust was gnawing cancer, rats in his skin, maggots in his nerves, an endless itching with no arms to scratch. The paths before and behind were obscured, frozen eyes fixed on the leaking, sore-riddled flesh of the ceiling. He hated the softness under him. Hated the easy, sick fluid dripping and seeping. Hated the flexibility. Hated with a mass that had moved beyond feeling.</p>\n<p>Hours later, he dropped like a numb, dead stone, landing on a heap of hissing, sputtering hulks. The darkness defied even his endless eyes, the vague humps of rusty, crumbling metal rolling in a sea of black pus. Mr. Redd. Mr. Reeedddd. Reeeeddddddddd. The squealing notes rose in a croaking monotone. He had taken. Given. It did not happen. There had been silver. There had been gold. There is rust. Mr. Clank raged, strained, snapping and shattering as he flexed out, clawing a helpless rage into the fleshy floor, digging for the bottom, for the escape, for the end, for the road</p>\n<p>Mr. Clank woke suddenly, as he always did, and refused to open his eyes.</p>\n<p>Previous: 1. <a href=\"/1-mr-headless\">Mr. Headless</a> by Anaxagoras<br/></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>Next: 3. <a href=\"/3-mr-money\">Mr. Money</a> by Tanhony</p>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"/tales-of-mr-collector\">Back to Hub</a></p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/mr-clank\">2.

been there?\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Redd was coming.\u00a0\u00a0He whimpered in time to the slipping key, refusing to look behind at the squealing sound far behind him.\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Clank tripped and fell, skidding into a heap of oozing garbage, lying there, too exhausted to move.\u00a0\u00a0His clockworks locked tight, bringing a soundless scream...then let go, only to lock again moments later.\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Clank whimpered, for help or release he wasn't sure, feeling a dimness seep up from the cracked road\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Clank woke suddenly, as he always did, crying ashy tears as his eyes slowly clicked open.\u00a0\u00a0The twilight was real, the bloated, boiling sun framed around trash fires and burning oil on the open plane.\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Clank screamed thinly, trying to cry as his rusted, pitted frame ratcheted up in a squeal of frozen bolts and rusty haze.\u00a0\u00a0Trying to grit his teeth against the agony, he found his lower jaw was gone, his exposed teeth dry and brittle in the thick air.\u00a0\u00a0The city walls were an unbroken wall behind him, his path from there forgotten, his way forward a stumbling, slow-motion shamble among slag, burning oil pipes, and shifting trash.\u00a0\u00a0Forward.\u00a0\u00a0His legs dug in on worn spines, steely points fogging rust.\u00a0\u00a0Forward.\n\n\n\nHours later, Mr. Clank lay, twitching and clicking, at the edge of the pit.\u00a0\u00a0Night had fallen like a slimy sheet, smothering vision, thought and breath in an oily tarp.\u00a0\u00a0Time was passing over him like ants, Mr. Clank lying like a dead thing, moaning in a raspy squeal as he watched the searing sun.\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Redd was...waiting...needing?\u00a0\u00a0Missing.\u00a0\u00a0Wishing.\u00a0\u00a0Listening?\u00a0\u00a0The words were shards, jabbing and freezing his stripped and sputtering gears.\u00a0\u00a0Sparks hissed and arched, a belt stretching and going slack, the memory of breath coming in torturous, moaning gasps.\u00a0\u00a0The Pit.\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Clank twitched and flexed, trying to get in, but his eyes glazed, frozen in a blank stare, watching the slow undulation of the road\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Clank woke suddenly, as he always did, lidless eyes fixed on the pulsing walls.\u00a0\u00a0The blackness was total, and yet he saw.\u00a0\u00a0His body hissed and squealed, a paralyzed mass, brassy orbs mocking sight from the mass of screws.\u00a0\u00a0The rust was gnawing cancer, rats in his skin, maggots in his nerves, an endless itching with no arms to scratch.\u00a0\u00a0The paths before and behind were obscured, frozen eyes fixed on the leaking, sore-riddled flesh of the ceiling.\u00a0\u00a0He hated the softness under him.\u00a0\u00a0Hated the easy, sick fluid dripping and seeping.\u00a0\u00a0Hated the flexibility.\u00a0\u00a0Hated with a mass that had moved beyond feeling.\n\n\n\nHours later, he dropped like a numb, dead stone, landing on a heap of hissing, sputtering hulks.\u00a0\u00a0The darkness defied even his endless eyes, the vague humps of rusty, crumbling metal rolling in a sea of black pus.\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Redd.\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Reeedddd.\u00a0\u00a0Reeeeddddddddd.\u00a0\u00a0The squealing notes rose in a croaking monotone.\u00a0\u00a0He had taken.\u00a0\u00a0Given.\u00a0\u00a0It did not happen.\u00a0\u00a0There had been silver.\u00a0\u00a0There had been gold.\u00a0\u00a0There is rust.\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Clank raged, strained, snapping and shattering as he flexed out, clawing a helpless rage into the fleshy floor, digging for the bottom, for the escape, for the end, for the road\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Clank woke suddenly, as he always did, and refused to open his eyes.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious: 1.

Like 'ha ha! hee hee!' So I'm in the middle of this, this big shopping centre right? Like with strip malls on all sides, ha ha? But that's not very funny is it!

It hurt my feelings a little, ha ha.</p>\n<p>I wasn't mean or anything though! I even decided to show them a good trick! I said \u201cwould you like a hand\u201d to one of the kids, hee hee, and then I put my hand out to shake his\u2026 but then when he grabbed my hand, it came off, and I said, I said, \u201cThere, now you've got a spare one!\u201d Ha ha! Funny, right?</p>\n<p>Only the kid just screamed and ran away, which I thought, I thought was kind of mean, because it was a good trick, you know! A little bit painful when it comes off but good! Then I had to get out my little sewing kit and put my trick hand back on and, hee hee, clean up all the blood because you know I am a very good citizen who would never leave a mess in the middle of the street like that!</p>\n<p>Then, then I remembered I was supposed to be going somewhere, somewhere important! I had to go down, down to the fair to meet the others! Ha ha, silly me forgetting something like that. Silly, stupid, worthless clown, ha ha! Ha ha! So I started down the street toward the fair when these men in weird coats came in a screaming car and asked if I was hurt. They were not funny at all and their screaming car made my ears hurt, so, so when one of them came close I decided to shake his hand with a buzzer, ha ha! He was very surprised when he shook my hand! He was so surprised, his eyes popped right out of his sockets! I laughed very hard when that happened! It was less funny when they were dangling on bloody little cords and he started screaming, but that was okay because the other men took him away in the screaming car, so I did not have to look at them very long.</p>\n<p>I am a very mean clown sometimes, hee hee. A very bad, stupid clown, ha ha! That is a funny joke, even if it hurts my feelings a little, hee hee. I know it is funny because Mr. Redd always laughed so hard when he said it! Ha ha! Mr. Redd was not very funny, but he sure laughed a lot. Maybe HE should have been Mr. Laugh! Ha ha! Would that ever be a funny joke! If I ever met Mr. Redd again, I would have to tell him what a funny joke I had thought of. Maybe he would laugh! Sometimes he stopped hurting me for a little, when he laughed.</p>\n<p>I picked up my big floppy shoes and walked on down to the fair.</p>\n<p>Previous: <a href=\"/11-mr-feather\">11.

Funny, right?\n\n\n\nOnly the kid just screamed and ran away, which I thought, I thought was kind of mean, because it was a good trick, you know! A little bit painful when it comes off but good! Then I had to get out my little sewing kit and put my trick hand back on and, hee hee, clean up all the blood because you know I am a very good citizen who would never leave a mess in the middle of the street like that!\n\n\n\nThen, then I remembered I was supposed to be going somewhere, somewhere important! I had to go down, down to the fair to meet the others! Ha ha, silly me forgetting something like that. Silly, stupid, worthless clown, ha ha! Ha ha! So I started down the street toward the fair when these men in weird coats came in a screaming car and asked if I was hurt. They were not funny at all and their screaming car made my ears hurt, so, so when one of them came close I decided to shake his hand with a buzzer, ha ha! He was very surprised when he shook my hand! He was so surprised, his eyes popped right out of his sockets! I laughed very hard when that happened! It was less funny when they were dangling on bloody little cords and he started screaming, but that was okay because the other men took him away in the screaming car, so I did not have to look at them very long.\n\n\n\nI am a very mean clown sometimes, hee hee. A very bad, stupid clown, ha ha! That is a funny joke, even if it hurts my feelings a little, hee hee. I know it is funny because Mr. Redd always laughed so hard when he said it! Ha ha! Mr. Redd was not very funny, but he sure laughed a lot. Maybe HE should have been Mr. Laugh! Ha ha! Would that ever be a funny joke! If I ever met Mr. Redd again, I would have to tell him what a funny joke I had thought of. Maybe he would laugh! Sometimes he stopped hurting me for a little, when he laughed.\n\n\n\nI picked up my big floppy shoes and walked on down to the fair.\n\n\n\nPrevious: [[[11.

You're not the one who shoved him off the building with a live grenade. You were doing your honest best t'follow orders and take the bastard in alive. You were doing just fine, too, until Nobody killed him.</p>\n<p>Well, yeah, obviously, someone killed him. I meant Nobody, the person. Or people. Or whatever. You've heard of Nobody, right?</p>\n<p>Yeah, that one. Does mysterious shit, helps or hurts us, an' then he disappears. He's the one who did it, understand?</p>\n<p>No, it's not exactly lying. Okay, so it's lying, but it's lying to cover your ass, which is practically a moral obligation at this point.</p>\n<p>Look, you're new, so I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. Everybody wants things to be simple. They want the world to make sense. Even the higher-ups. Sure, they know the world's fucked up, but they want it fucked up in a way they understand. Things out here, in the field, they get messy. Sometimes, we gotta do things they wouldn't understand. And sometimes we make honest mistakes. The higher-ups don't wanna think that sorta thing happens. We're their hands and eyes. We go out, we fix problems for them, and so far as they're concerned, we always do it the way they want.</p>\n<p>Like, sometimes maybe you end up needing help from outside. We all know the other guys in the GOC, or MC&amp;D, or hell, even in the CI. We trade favors when we have to, but the higher-ups wouldn't understand it, and they'd fuck it all up. Or maybe they want us to take in something alive that turns your blood to fire by lookin' at you, and never mind how you're supposed to get it done.</p>\n<p>We do what we gotta do. We try to make the mission go through. Sometimes, that means we gotta do things they wouldn't like, sometimes it means we cut our losses. And then, when you write up the report, you gotta make everything nice and neat in a way the higher-ups understand. That's where Nobody comes in.</p>\n<p>Everyone knows Nobody does shit that doesn't make much sense. Sometimes he helps us, gives us information, works with us. Sometimes, he comes in and fucks it up. The higher-ups, they <em>understand</em> about Nobody. They don't like him, but they accept that he exists and that there's not much we can do about it. So, when we write up these reports, he's real handy for tying up loose ends. At the end of the day, the mission gets done the best we can do it, and the higher-ups get a story they can swallow.</p>\n<p>So kid, you didn't do it. You tried to take the skip in alive, but Nobody got in the way. Said some mysterious crap, I'll come up with that, and then left before we could stop him. Maybe jumped off the rooftop. He does shit like that, after all. He's Nobody.</p>\n<p>Is he real? I dunno, kid.

A cartoon, it detailed a fantasy kingdom that suddenly discovers that they are the dream of a sleeping man, and that soon his alarm would ring. They mount an expedition to the world and cover the man's ears and muffle the clock. He then starts to dream of flamingos, but the concept was so striking at the time that I never forgot it. The concept of reality as a plastic, immaterial stratum and not at all the bedrock of the world.</p>\n<p>Is it possible that we're all flamingos-to-be? Swirling and running about in utter confidence, only to find we're less material then the average soap bubble, and much more transient? What would that do to our view of ourselves and the world? Suddenly the sacrifices we've made, the pain and suffering endured and caused, all count for nothing at all. I'm sure you can appreciate the blind horror of a realization of that nature. How much suffering and bleak moral choices could be invalidated by the next alarm clock?</p>\n<p>I should be another faceless, shapeless victim. Another sacrifice made for the greater, intangible Good. And I was, for a while, both my mother and I. Left to twist and sway like leaves in the wake of your shadowy passing, bobbing around the sudden void left behind. She will most likely remain a victim. I will not. You can take what you wish, as you wish, and have done so for some time. You are thieves on a grand scale. My father once said, however, that no matter how good you are at something, how confident you may be, there is always someone, somewhere, that is better.</p>\n<p>I am going to prove his theory.</p>\n<p>You have taken something from me. So I, in turn, shall take many things from you. I know you will ignore this for now, but later, when the time comes, you will look back to this letter, and despair. As a red spider once said, \u201cI am going to make you cry.\u201d</p>\n<p>My father, for all his intellectual might, was a cripple at chess. Something about it just confounded his sense. Even at my tender age, I was able to beat him with some regularity. He insisted on being white, always, as his handicap. Forever the white king.</p>\n<p>I am the Black Queen.

I am Agent Max Lombardi. I am your instructor, on account that my leg is broken and someone in Personnel hates me.</p>\n<p>Now, you're here because the possibility exists that you are not jackasses and might could be useful in the containment of anomalous items what are going to try to kill you.</p>\n<p>So, let's start with the basic mission. We are out to find weird shit and bring it back, and then to contain it. Your more scholarly colleagues are the ones who study it from behind bullet-proof glass and bitch about how hard their job is. They are receiving a similar briefing in Room 67. They got donuts and coffee in there, just in case you was hopin' there might be some modicum of justice in this cold, uncarin' bitch of a universe.</p>\n<p>Anyway, some of youse are gonna be retrieval, like me, while others are gonna be containment. You might even switch it around sometimes. Retrieval generally is preceeded by investigation by intel. Intel\u2014who also have coffee and donuts, in case you were wonderin' how far the budget stretches\u2014will go forth, find leads, gather facts, and then tell you sweet fuck all.</p>\n<p>On receipt of this dearth of information, you will go out to exotic locales where you will be forbidden from stoppin' and havin' a drink or conversin' with the locals what aren't tryin' to kill you. You will go to where intel tells you the whatever-the-fuck is. An agent much higher on the food chain than you will go and talk to people for the purpose of figurin' out what's goin' on. Do not envy this agent. Shit goes wrong, he's in the worst place possible. Anyway, once he gives the go-ahead, the rest of the team comes in and takes out the skip as quiet as possible.</p>\n<p>Skip, by the way, is what we call said anomalous entities. I am sure I do not need to tell you where it comes from.</p>\n<p>Now, sometimes skips don't come along so quiet as we would like. I mean, sure, maybe it's a nice inanimate object that don't hurt no one, or some guy who don't even want to go around free if he's hurtin' someone. Most of the time, it's somethin' easy. But sometimes, it's somethin' that really don't want to come along quiet-like an' it has the means to enforce its wishes. So you apply stronger coercion. Ideally, intel will have figured out what this skip can take an' you can proceed directly to enough firepower to knock it loopy. Ideally, we would have donuts and coffee.

Who here is willin' to die rather than give up on the mission? One, two, three, four\u2026 Okay, you five fail. Counter to what some dingbats will tell you, the latter is actually the preferred option. Capturin' skips is the name of the game, but findin' agents who can actually do the fuckin' job is hard, an' you can always catch more skips later on. Your best option is to run the fuck away. That way, they can always send someone else in to get the fucker. If you can't, an' it comes down to a life-or-limb decision, that's when you pull out your gun and you shoot the fucker.

We are out to find weird shit and bring it back, and then to contain it. Your more scholarly colleagues are the ones who study it from behind bullet-proof glass and bitch about how hard their job is. They are receiving a similar briefing in Room 67. They got donuts and coffee in there, just in case you was hopin' there might be some modicum of justice in this cold, uncarin' bitch of a universe.\n\n\n\nAnyway, some of youse are gonna be retrieval, like me, while others are gonna be containment. You might even switch it around sometimes. Retrieval generally is preceeded by investigation by intel. Intel\u2014who also have coffee and donuts, in case you were wonderin' how far the budget stretches\u2014will go forth, find leads, gather facts, and then tell you sweet fuck all.\n\n\n\nOn receipt of this dearth of information, you will go out to exotic locales where you will be forbidden from stoppin' and havin' a drink or conversin' with the locals what aren't tryin' to kill you. You will go to where intel tells you the whatever-the-fuck is. An agent much higher on the food chain than you will go and talk to people for the purpose of figurin' out what's goin' on. Do not envy this agent. Shit goes wrong, he's in the worst place possible. Anyway, once he gives the go-ahead, the rest of the team comes in and takes out the skip as quiet as possible.\n\n\n\nSkip, by the way, is what we call said anomalous entities.\u00a0\u00a0I am sure I do not need to tell you where it comes from.\n\n\n\nNow, sometimes skips don't come along so quiet as we would like. I mean, sure, maybe it's a nice inanimate object that don't hurt no one, or some guy who don't even want to go around free if he's hurtin' someone. Most of the time, it's somethin' easy. But sometimes, it's somethin' that really don't want to come along quiet-like an' it has the means to enforce its wishes.\u00a0\u00a0So you apply stronger coercion. Ideally, intel will have figured out what this skip can take an' you can proceed directly to enough firepower to knock it loopy. Ideally, we would have donuts and coffee. Since we usually go in knowin' jack shit, you'll start off with your bare hands and work up from there.\n\n\n\nNow, at a certain point, it looks like yer gonna have to choose between catchin' the skip an' comin' home on your own two feet. Who here is willin' to die rather than give up on the mission? One, two, three, four... Okay, you five fail. Counter to what some dingbats will tell you, the latter is actually the preferred option. Capturin' skips is the name of the game, but findin' agents who can actually do the fuckin' job is hard, an' you can always catch more skips later on. Your best option is to run the fuck away. That way, they can always send someone else in to get the fucker. If you can't, an' it comes down to a life-or-limb decision, that's when you pull out your gun and you shoot the fucker. If that don't work, you shoot it again, because ninety-nine times outta a hundred, shootin' //will// work if you do //enough// of it.\n\n\n\nThis don't mean you got leave to shoot anything that moves 'cause Agent Lombardi told you so. You do it when you gotta. We aim to bring these things in whole an' intact. But if that ain't gonna happen, the Foundation will settle for studyin' what's left.\n\n\n\nSo, them's the basics of retrieval. The rest of you are gonna be involved in containment.\n\n\n\nNow, containment is in some ways easier.

She was a Green, albeit a weak one. We argued. He shot me, and then her. I didn't die. I shot him back, and held her while she died. That girl... she's stayed with me, Everett.\n\n\n\nI digress. The GOC wasn't for me. So, I made overtures to the Foundation. If I couldn't defeat them, maybe I could subvert them from within. No one was more surprised than myself when they sent me to talk with me. But it made my cover complete. None of them have ever suspected me. My tentacles stretch throughout this Foundation. I can take it down whenever I need to.\n\n\n\nJust thought you should know.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\nClef pried the flask from Mann's unresisting hand. Over the course of the story, the doctor had made his way under his desk, where he now just sat and rocked, whimpering to himself. The Agent smirked, and began to exit, when Mann managed to croak out a response. \n\n\n\n\"Alto...Why?\"\n\n\n\nClef just smirked. \"Please, Everett. We've known each other for long enough. Call me Jack.\"\n", "references": [], "tags": ["doctor-bright", "doctor-clef", "doctor-mann", "global-occult-coalition", "tale"], "title": "Origin of Clef - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/originofclef", "year": 2011}, "pan-wotcher": {"created_at": "2011-07-12T03:55:00", "creator": "Gargus", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Gargus", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/gargus", "comment": "A new story.

In light of the unexplained growth of SCP-113 one week ago, a jet left Storage Site-23 approximately four hours ago, with the intended destination being Site-24, due to their expertise in the area. The jet\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"Please, Winthrop,\" sighed the Director, rubbing his forehead. \"If the reports I've received are correct, time is of the essence. Speak simply.\"</p>\n<p>\"My apologizes, sir,\" stumbled Agent Winthrop. \"I just thought\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"The <em>point</em>, Winthrop, the <em>point.</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes sir. After flying for roughly two hours, the jet came under attack by an as-of-now unknown individual or organization. From what we can gather, someone from in the Site had let slip certain details of the transport, and the attackers figured it out from there. We lost three men today.\" Agent Winthrop bowed his head out of respect.</p>\n<p>\"Do we know what sort of weapon was used?\"</p>\n<p>\"No, sir,\" said Winthrop, snapping back to attention. \"There are suspicions of a ballistic missile, but we have no way of confirming it. All we know for certain is that they were capable of attacking a plane flying above 10,000 feet, and that the weapon was designed for maximum fallout.\"</p>\n<p>The Director waited for a moment before signaling Winthrop to continue. Already, plans were forming in his head regarding how to stop any damage.</p>\n<p>\"Given the immense size of SCP-113 at the time of departure and the rate at which it was growing, a simple missile strike would have spread it out over approximately 2,000 square miles. However, given the type of missile our attackers were using, we estimate the damage area to cover around 85% of the planet's landmass. It's a confusing yet fascinating weapon, all things considered, sir\u2026\" Agent Winthrop trailed off at the last sentence, feeling ashamed of what he had said.</p>\n<p>The Director continued to think, his brow furrowing as he eliminated unlikely options. As Agent Winthrop opened his mouth to ask a question, the Director snapped, \"Keep talking. What kind of damage reports are we looking at?\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, sir, even with SCP-113 diluted as it is, it's still potent enough to change the gender of anyone who comes into contact with it, regardless of whether they're inside or out. Even microscopic pieces can trigger the process. We haven't conducted enough tests to be certain, but it's very likely a few hundred people will die from the shock alone.\" He paused and shuffled his feet. \"There's also the, erm\u2026 other matter\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"Which one?\" asked the Director under his breath.</p>\n<p>\"To be honest, there's no\u2026 <em>feasible</em> way for a human male to carry children, sir. Our current numbers around showing something on the order of 150 million women pregnant on the planet at this time. If we can't get to them quick enough, there are going to be internal\u2026 complications. The sex change will more than likely\u2026 kill them and the\u2026 children\u2026 sir.\" Agent Winthrop's face took on an ashen look as he spoke. \"And of course, there are dozens of smaller issues that we don't have time to list right now\u2026\"</p>\n<p>Grunting, the Director raised himself out of his chair, and walked around to Winthrop. Looking closely over the Agent, he said \"Listen carefully, now, Winthrop. I do believe that I have a plan that can reduce the damage. Not <em>prevent</em> it, but <em>reduce</em> it. This plan could very well work, if we act fast. Human lives will be lost, yes, but there is nothing we can do about that. Before we can make this work, there is one thing I need to know. How much time do we have?\"</p>\n<p>\"Sir, current ETA before first effects is five minutes.\"</p>\n<p>A silence settled over the room as the Director took in this last statement. Agent Winthrop grew increasingly nervous as he watched the Director just stand there, staring off into space. He reached out a hand to help his boss, but only grasped air. Walking slowly, the director sat back down, and folded his hands before him.</p>\n<p>\"Agent Winthrop,\" he said slowly, avoiding eye contact. \"I suggest you find yourself a change in underclothing.\"</p>\n<p>Stumbling over himself, Winthrop managed to sputter, \"B-but, sir! We have an immense catastrophe staring us in the face! Millions are about to die! How is it that you can joke at a time like this? Didn't you have a plan?\"</p>\n<p>Solemnly pushing himself back in the chair, the Director sighed and looked straight at the Agent. \"Winthrop. How long have you worked for the Foundation? Three years, I think it is?\" A nod confirmed this speculation. \"Then allow me to explain something to you about this organization. We're not perfect.\"</p>\n<p>\"I already know that\u2026\" began Winthrop, but he was cut off by a wave of the hand.</p>\n<p>\"What you <em>know</em> is that even when we make mistakes, even when containment procedures are broken, even when some horrible creature is discovered and goes on a killing spree, what you <em>know</em> is this. Most of the time, we can still make a happy ending. The Foundation has enough experienced and talented people on hand to deflect the majority of the problems that come our way, and maintain the semblance of peace.</p>\n<p>\"However, for all the good we do, we are not infallible. Every once in a very, very long while, we are going to come up against a problem that has no solution. We are not gods. We cannot do everything. We cannot save an entire planet within five minutes. At times like this, all we are capable of doing is letting things happen, clean up afterwards, and yes, joke a little. At times like this, we are powerless.\"</p>\n<p>Still willing to fight, Winthrop said, \"Sir, we have to do something. Anything.\"</p>\n<p>\"James, what do you propose we do?\"</p>\n<p>The Agent waved his hands for a few moments, desperately trying to think of something to do, some way to save the lives of millions and be a hero. But nothing came to him, and, slowly but surely, he ceased moving, and simply looked dejected. Noticing that the conversation was ending, the Director scribbled out a message on a piece of paper. \"Give this to the rest of your men. It's instructions for damage control. And James?

Dodridge was observed to stumble out of the vehicle, fall down, curse, and subsequently engage SCP-723-D in hand-to-hand combat.

After the notification, Dodridge proceeded to board the Humvee and accelerated to approximately 90 kph toward the target. It it unknown whether or not the resultant impact had any effect on the subject, due to the remnants of the testing area being partially obscured by a small vehicle fire, likely caused by a failure to drain the fuel tank prior to terminal impact. Dodridge was observed to stumble out of the vehicle, fall down, curse, and subsequently engage SCP-723-D in hand-to-hand combat. After attempting to strangle the target for approximately fifteen minutes, Dodridge screamed inarticulately, extinguished the smoldering wreckage, and left the chamber.//\n\n-----\n\nIt is believed that, at this time, several days of work and frustration were beginning to wear on both Agents involved.\n\n-----\n\n**Excerpt from after-action review for disciplinary proceedings involving Agent Lament and Agent Dodridge - Personal statements of Security Officer Bernard\u00a0\u00a0\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588**\n\n\n\nAfter failing to neutralize SCP-723-D yet again, Agent Lament and Agent Dodridge proceeded to the on-site bar, where they demanded to be served.\u00a0\u00a0After accosting seven other patrons, I removed them from the premises and followed them to Agent Dodridge's room, where they left after several minutes, carrying what appeared to be a box of cigars and a duffel bag containing bottles of alcohol.

Taking in such a vast quantity of objects is simply not possible.</p>\n<p>\"Second, our purpose is to contain anomalous objects. It is not explicitly stated, true, but they are the ones that only we can deal with.

Everyone present turned to see the Head of Staff sitting perfectly still, a steely look in his eyes.\n\n\n\n\"All of you sit down,\" he said slowly. A quick rush for chairs followed. \"Get back in order.\" A straightening of ties and clearing of throats. Silence fell over the room for a moment. Erit moved the speak once again, but the Head of Staff stopped him with a raised hand.\n\n\n\n\"Mister Invictus, it appears you missed a few key points during your initial orientation. Allow me to elaborate them for you.\" Researcher Erit nodded his head. \"First off, despite our vast resources, the Foundation simply cannot afford to contain everything. Regardless of how expensive certain containments may be, they are always kept under a balanced budget. Taking in such a vast quantity of objects is simply not possible.\n\n\n\n\"Second, our purpose is to contain anomalous objects. It is not explicitly stated, true, but they are the ones that only we can deal with. Normal organizations simply cannot handle them, and most Groups of Interest wish to use them for selfish or self-destructive purposes. Our focus must be on the paranormal, the supernatural; the everyday, no matter how dangerous, can be left to someone else.\"\n\n\n\n\"But sir\u2026\" began Erit, holding out his hands.\n\n\n\n\"//Left to someone else//,\" growled the Head of Staff. Erit swallowed again and nodded. \"Third, as was mentioned in your little quarrel, it is not our job to decide what the human race is ready for. That should speak for itself.\n\n\n\n\"And finally,\" he said, casting a glare over everyone else present, \"I want to see the attempts to utilize the teleportation system shut down. It goes against policy, and is the only thing Mister Erit got right in his presentation.\" He turned to look at Researcher Invictus again. \"We get enough of this from new members of the staff. Don't fall into old habits, Mister Invictus. That will be all.\" He sat back in his chair again, and reassumed a disinterested position.\n\n\n\nErit stood at the front of the meeting for a few moments, coughed, and switched over to his final slide. \"This concludes my presentation. Any questions?\" Several dark glares from those assembled. \"Right then. I'll just be\u2026\" He shuffled back to his seat.\n\n\n\n\"And now, our final item of the day,\" said the Head of Staff, shuffling his papers once more, \"Researcher Gargus wishes to speak to you all on the state of the fourth wall after his constant assaults on it\u2026\"\n", "references": [], "tags": ["tale"], "title": "People Are Not Wearing Enough Hats - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/people-are-not-wearing-enough-hats", "year": 2011}, "pila": {"created_at": "2011-10-24T04:54:00", "creator": "TroyL", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "", "date": "2011-10-24T04:54:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale, thaumiel.

It\u2019s easy for someone like you to forget things, after all. Are you liking the nice, cushy job? How are your boys?\u201d\n\n\n\nClef frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, Ko\u2014\u201c\n\n\n\n\u201cDrop the bullshit, Clef\u2026 You keep doing your damnedest to lie yourself out of everything. To lie in circles, keep people guessing\u2026 But I finally figured it out. It took me a while\u2014a very long while\u2014but I finally got it. Heh. Clever bastard.\u201d\n\n\n\nClef eased himself backwards in the chair. \u201cAnd?\u201d he asked.\n\n\n\nKondraki smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s easy.\u00a0\u00a0You see, I spent years analyzing the records of you\u2026 Your exploits here.\u00a0\u00a0The things that you were willing and not willing to do.\u00a0\u00a0It took me forever to figure out why 682 had that moment of hesitation\u2026 Why it didn\u2019t kill you. Why reality benders don\u2019t fuck you up like they do other people.\u00a0\u00a0Why 343 shits his pants at the sight of you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd?\u201d Clef asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple,\u201d Kondraki said. \u201cYou\u2019re God.\u201d\n\n\n\nClef laughed. Hard.\u00a0\u00a0Leaning over, he coughed loudly, struggling to breathe. Minutes passed until he was completely out of breath and had to stop, leaning back in his chair.\n\n\n\n\u201cReally, Konny? Me? God?\u201d\n\n\n\nKondraki smiled, eerily. Madly. \u201cCertainly,\u201d he said. \u201cBut not just any God.\u00a0\u00a0You're Poopstick McGee... And I...

Shaking his head, he made out the softly breathing form of his wife, and on the other side the small, pale outline of his son. He stood, all of three years old, holding a small blanket and fidgeting slightly. His father rolled to his side, looking at the small boy, managing a sleepy smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey big boy.\u201d<br/>\n\u201cI need to use potty.\u201d</p>\n<p>He sighed, laying back down. This had been going on too long. Finally potty trained (mostly), the boy had the odd quirk of not wanting to be alone in the bathroom. Ever. His wife kept saying it was harmless, but it still seemed odd.</p>\n<p>\u201cBubba, you can just go use the potty.\u201d<br/>\nThe little boy shook his head with all the seriousness a three year old can muster.<br/>\n\u201cNeed daddy. Come with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He closed his eyes, breathing slowly. He had to be up in three hours, still had to find something for lunch\u2026he was tired, deeply tired. He looked back at his son, whispering in the dark.</p>\n<p>\u201cLittle boy, you need to go use that potty now. It's-\u201d<br/>\n\u201cBut I need-\u201d<br/>\n\u201cNo buts, go in there, use the potty and go back to bed now. Do you understand?\u201d<br/>\nThe little boy nodded slowly, sniffling and stepping slowly from the bedroom.</p>\n<p>He lay back, trying to recover sleep, nearly there when his wife mumbled sleepily \u201cmuhp. Wha was that?\u201d. He sighed, closing his eyes harder. \u201cIt was just the boy, he needed to go potty\u201d.</p>\n<p>She sat up a bit, looking to him. \u201cYou didn't go with him?\u201d<br/>\n\u201cNo, I didn't. He's too big to still be doing this, there's no reason.\u201d<br/>\n\u201cHe just gets nervous, you know that. He's still just a little boy.\u201d</p>\n<p>He sighed hard, sinking in to the bed slightly, knowing what was coming next.

He stumbled, wedging open the barest slit of one eye, in the hopes of making the dive back to sleep easier.

He reached for the light switch, fumbling through a clump of cold, damp grime to flick the switch. The light was dimmed by the spray of reeking slime, but it showed the bathroom well enough.

He stared in to the room, blinking dumbly in to the sudden silence. Then, again\u2026thunk. The toilet seat flicked up, maybe a inch, and clunked back down. Like it was being bumped from underneath. From inside the bowl. He stared, watching it sit still for a few beats, then bump up again. Somewhere, his brain was chanting \u201cwhere is my son\u201d over and over, but it seemed remote, distant.

Suddenly, his son's broken, torn hand clenched down hard, and ripped away, vanishing down the pipe with a scrape.

side the small, pale outline of his son.\u00a0\u00a0He stood, all of three years old, holding a small blanket and fidgeting slightly.\u00a0\u00a0His father rolled to his side, looking at the small boy, managing a sleepy smile.\n\n\n\n\u201cHey big boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need to use potty.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe sighed, laying back down.\u00a0\u00a0This had been going on too long.\u00a0\u00a0Finally potty trained (mostly), the boy had the odd quirk of not wanting to be alone in the bathroom.\u00a0\u00a0Ever.\u00a0\u00a0His wife kept saying it was harmless, but it still seemed odd.\n\n\n\n\u201cBubba, you can just go use the potty.\u201d\n\nThe little boy shook his head with all the seriousness a three year old can muster.\n\n\u201cNeed daddy.\u00a0\u00a0Come with me.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe closed his eyes, breathing slowly.\u00a0\u00a0He had to be up in three hours, still had to find something for lunch...he was tired, deeply tired.\u00a0\u00a0He looked back at his son, whispering in the dark.\n\n\n\n\u201cLittle boy, you need to go use that potty now.\u00a0\u00a0It's-\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I need-\u201d\n\n\u201cNo buts, go in there, use the potty and go back to bed now.\u00a0\u00a0Do you understand?\u201d\n\nThe little boy nodded slowly, sniffling and stepping slowly from the bedroom.\n\n\n\nHe lay back, trying to recover sleep, nearly there when his wife mumbled sleepily \u201cmuhp.\u00a0\u00a0Wha was that?\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0He sighed, closing his eyes harder.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt was just the boy, he needed to go potty\u201d.\n\n\n\nShe sat up a bit, looking to him.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou didn't go with him?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I didn't.\u00a0\u00a0He's too big to still be doing this, there's no reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe just gets nervous, you know that.\u00a0\u00a0He's still just a little boy.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe sighed hard, sinking in to the bed slightly, knowing what was coming next.\u00a0\u00a0Never mind he had to work, or was tired, or hadn't been able to get to bed until late, or-\n\n\n\n\u201ccan you go check on him?\u201d\n\n\u201c...\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease go check on him.\u201d\n\n\u201cMrrr...ok, hold on.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe slid from the

It's not a mission brief.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, a case has been opened, so everything-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA CASE has been opened over this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSir, it's simpler if I just show you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine, proceed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOk, as you know, around six hours ago, we received a VHS tape. Well, to be more precise, one of our drivers found it sitting on his passenger seat when he came in from a drop. Due to the suspicious nature of this, and that he was in a secured area when it happened, we-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBah, skip to the end, I have two more meetings before lunch.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 We reviewed the tape. It\u2026 actually, it's probably faster to show you. If you'll look at the screen\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 God, why is the image so degraded\u2026 oh, right, you said it was a tape, right? Who still\u2026 wait, who is that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe believe that's Agent Penbry. We've done some checking, he was on dispatch in Louisiana. His partner was found dead in their hotel room, Penbry was missing and hadn't checked in since the night before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow the hell did he just get grabbed? And end up\u2026 like that, no less. What is that he's tied to, anyway?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt's\u2026 ahh\u2026 called a wooden horse, or 'Spanish donkey'; it's a torture and fetish device\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus, what the hell do you have me watching? I\u2026 who is that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe're not sure yet, beyond assuming she's the one who took Penbry. We've done some prelim work, and-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is she\u2026 oh god\u2026 oh fuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026 have the audio down. Penbry's screaming won't really add anything important to the brief. She didn't even ask him anything. Didn't threaten him, or talk\u2026 just\u2026 dived in, as it were.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow is he still conscious for this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe may have drugged him, or he\u2026 might be in too much pain. The optic nerve isn't meant to be stretched like-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus, turn it off\u2026 turn it OFF goddammit!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 As you can see\u2026 we feel a case may need to be opened at this point.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I smoke in here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly if you share\u2026 So, anyway, the tape goes on\u2026 and on and on, but eventually she starts asking him things. She probes and prods, mentally and physically\u2026 and\u2026 well, she got it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 Got\u2026 what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEverything. Everything Penbry knew, anyway. Even the heavy memetic shielded stuff\u2026 walked him through it a bit at a time, kept him just barely on the edge of a shutdown\u2026 and just drained him. Outside our own staff, I've never seen anything like it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus\u2026 what was she after? Just probing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSir, she didn't even know that we had a name.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the living hell\u2026 so\u2026 a total outsider, an amateur no less\u2026 just walks in and uses one of our Agents like a sock puppet?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAhh\u2026 there\u2026 may be something else. After we reviewed the tape, we started taking it apart, looking for\u2026 anything, really. It was sterile, just plastic and film, but there was something taped to the inside.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 Dammit, don't keep me in suspense, man.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2026 was a black queen. Like the chess piece? The crown\u2026 the crown was a tooth. It was Penbry's.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat's more, some digging has turned up a letter we received months ago\u2026 it wasn't deemed credible at the time, but someone identified as the 'Black Queen' makes some very overt threats, among other things. It's being looked into now, but it seems very likely that this isn't a total amateur. It\u2026 may be someone with peripheral Foundation ties.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExplain peripheral.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is implied that we removed her father from her home at a young age.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don't do that any more, barely did it back then, the high intensity recruitment\u2026 no. No. It couldn't\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have a team at Site 2, in the master archives. Nothing from that period has been updated to the digital media yet, so it's\u2026 slow going, to say the least. We can't say conclusively who she may be, yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt's probably his daughter, isn't it? Goddamn\u2026 I don't even see how it's possible\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSir, with as long as we've been at this, I'm surprised something like this has taken as long as it has.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 Realistically, how bad is this for us?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Foundation is not about to crumble over one pissed off girl. At the same time, initial reviewers are observing some real intelligence and possible severe mental imbalance. I'm sure she's getting help, but how and from where I have no idea. She's smart, cunning, and seems to lack anything even approaching empathy. If we were talking about anyone else, I'd be bringing up recruitment by now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 Any projections on how this will play out?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe fed a man his own retina, sir.

I'm (sigh) Research Assistant Corbette. I'm gonna be straight here\u2026 I kind of had a long night last night aaaand I threw up an Advil this morning. So\u2026 yeah. You may be wondering why <em>I'm</em> giving this orientation. That's a good question.</p>\n<p>Anyways, I'm here to talk to you about properly recording things when you write down containment procedures, or descriptions, or\u2026 incident reports, or\u2026 yeah\u2026 This is, uh, pretty important, I guess. I mean, you can't write shitty reports, or else you'll be, y'know, fired, or\u2026 something\u2026</p>\n<p>Okay, now, before we even get onto writing stuff it's important that you all know what to add as a picture. Now, I know some of these things may be scary to photograph, but I swear to god, if I see one more fucking artist's depiction, I don't\u2026 It's just\u2026 No. Just\u2026 put in a picture or don't put something in at all, okay?</p>\n<p>So\u2026 the first part that everyone sees after the <em>photograph</em> is the item number. Now, I don't even know how many times I've seen some dumb-ass who didn't capitalize, or put in a hyphen, or some shit. Look, okay, that's just\u2026 How could you forget that? Honestly? What could possibly have made you forget to put in a FUCKING. HYPHEN. Jesus, I thought you were memetically chosen or some shit. I don't even know how they recruit nowadays. They, like, they do the online thing now, right? Yeah? Oh, okay, yeah. So, yeah, just\u2026 remember hyphens, okay?</p>\n<p>Now, after that comes the object class. Now, I don't care how pants-shittingly terrifying the gigantic blob looks, if all it's gonna do is make the floor slimy, it's NOT. KETER. Do we <em>need</em> to destroy this thing? No. Is it even going to kill any of us? No! Well\u2026 unless you're, like, old or some shit and break your hip. Look, just\u2026 try the locked room thing. I'm pretty sure you all know it, okay?

I'm (sigh) Research Assistant Corbette. I'm gonna be straight here... I kind of had a long night last night aaaand I threw up an Advil this morning. So... yeah. You may be wondering why //I'm// giving this orientation. That's a good question.\n\n\n\nAnyways, I'm here to talk to you about properly recording things when you write down containment procedures, or descriptions, or... incident reports, or... yeah... This is, uh, pretty important, I guess. I mean, you can't write shitty reports, or else you'll be, y'know, fired, or... something...\n\n\n\nOkay, now, before we even get onto writing stuff it's important that you all know what to add as a picture. Now, I know some of these things may be scary to photograph, but I swear to god, if I see one more fucking artist's depiction, I don't... It's just... No. Just... put in a picture or don't put something in at all, okay? \n\n\n\nSo... the first part that everyone sees after the //photograph// is the item number. Now, I don't even know how many times I've seen some dumb-ass who didn't capitalize, or put in a hyphen, or some shit. Look, okay, that's just... How could you forget that? Honestly? What could possibly have made you forget to put in a FUCKING. HYPHEN. Jesus, I thought you were memetically chosen or some shit. I don't even know how they recruit nowadays. They, like, they do the online thing now, right? Yeah? Oh, okay, yeah. So, yeah, just... remember hyphens, okay?\n\n\n\nNow, after that comes the object class. Now, I don't care how pants-shittingly terrifying the gigantic blob looks, if all it's gonna do is make the floor slimy, it's NOT. KETER. Do we //need// to destroy this thing? No. Is it even going to kill any of us? No! Well... unless you're, like, old or some shit and break your hip. Look, just... try the locked room thing. I'm pretty sure you all know it, okay? If it does //nothing// to escape the room, it's Safe. If you don't know what the fuck, it's Euclid. If it pops out and eats your grandmother who slipped on the slime covered floor and broke her hip, it's Keter. Okay? Okay.\n\n\n\nThe next p- Are you... are you serious? That's not even, like, a good ringtone. And you're a junior anyways, when the fuck did you get phone permissions? Give me that. Oh, look, he was texting somebody else. \"This class fucking su-\" Fuck you buddy! Get out of my class! No, get out! Jesus Christ. I didn't even want to teach this, ok? Can we just... can we move on, please?\n\n\n\nOkay, the Containment Procedures.

Kramer, normally a hair-trigger, was comatose. She'd burned out on the last mission and would be mostly useless until tomorrow while she recuperated. Harken pushed off the glass, drawing his gun as he walked to the door.

You might as well have a cup of coffee before you go.\"</p>\n<p>Agent Scud chuckled, following him in and shutting the door. He put his soaked overcoat over a chair as Harken moved quietly into the tiny kitchen. \"Where's Kramer?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harken waved to the bedroom. \u201cShe's in there\u2026 fuck, don't go in there, you moron! The hell is wrong with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Scud stepped away from the bedroom door, grinning. \u201cHey, I'm just interested, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI swear to god, if you do the 'are all her parts in tune?' gag, I will beat you to death with this coffee pot,\" Harken said. He poured two mugs of lukewarm coffee and handed one to Agent Scud.</p>\n<p>Scud laughed, shaking his head. \u201cNaw, already got my jollies out. Just curious. What's her deal, anyway? I've never really heard much about her, besides jokes and the whole supersoldier bit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harken stared, then shook his head. \u201cSupersoldier, huh? She's not a supersoldier, she's a\u2026\u201d He paused, put an ear to the door. The only sound was the low buzzing noise of Kramer's cybernetic components undergoing their usual regenerative cycle.</p>\n<p>Harken leaned in, lowering his voice. \u201cOk, here's the deal. She's not a supersoldier, or a war machine, or anything like that\u2026 not exactly. She grew up in the Church of The Broken God. Her parents were supposed to be some big so-and-sos in their clergy. They did things to her. I don't really know what: she doesn't talk about it much, but whatever it was, she almost died a few times. She lost her right eye, most of her right hand, her ears and most of her teeth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou're bullshitting me.\u201d Scud said, a nervous laugh in his voice.</p>\n<p>Harken sipped his coffee, staring into the oily liquid. \u201cNo bullshit. Most likely they were coaching her to become a Crusader: one of their \"holy knights of the machine.\" Or maybe they were just seeing what they could do. Anyway, they changed her body chemistry, did stuff to her brain to make her totally compliant and loyal to the higher ups in the Church.. It was working great until some goons hired by Marshall, Carter and Dark raided them. One of their members wanted some 'relic' they had in the basement, so they hired out some people to go and trash them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was a nightmare, from what she said.\u201d Harken continued. \"You know how she's all cold as ice and stuff? Well, even she gets the shakes talking about that night. They came right in the middle of a service. Shot some people, rounded up everyone else, all black masks and guns. They stole a bunch of stuff out of the vault, then lit the place on fire. She saw her parents, dead and bleeding on the steps to the podium. She never saw who shot them.\u201d He looked up, catching Scud's eyes. \u201cShe did see them get stacked up like cordwood near the door to make it look like they died trying to escape. Saw them start to burn as they dragged her out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scud stared in silence. Harken lit another cigarette. \u201cKramer was\u2026twelve, maybe thirteen? Barely a kid, but she saw the writing on the wall, did what she needed to do to survive. The mercs found her hiding in the sacristy. They almost put a bullet in her head, but then she told them she knew where the good stuff was, and how to get past the locks and traps and other shit like that. Mercs decided to take her back with them. They got a bonus for bringing her in.\"</p>\n<p>\"MC&amp;D loved her, it was like getting a blank check for them. They started adding things. Subdermal armour, ocular implants, amputated and replaced her legs below the knee, tweaked organs, a real overhaul. They made it so she could change her facial bone structure at will. It apparently feels like having a truck run over your face. She had to practice twice daily.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cSo she worked for richie-rich for a while, lots of combat stuff, and some\u2026 \u201d Harken coughed, checking the dim bedroom again. \u201c\u2026 well. She's never been hard on the eyes, you know, and you know what they say: if it exists, someone will want to fuck it. Sometimes she mixed the two. A few very rich blokes who somehow pissed off MC&amp;D got a razor in the neck while they were on the fly. Anyway, she did that for a while, then bumped into The Foundation during a breach event. She shot her handlers and turned herself over to the recovery Agents.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harken laughed, shaking his head. \u201cThose assholes came home feeling like they won the Super Bowl. Promotions all around. Almost lost her right off the bat: she had a stroke when they started to question her, some failsafe the richies had put in her brain. They got her working again, pumped her for information. After they squeezed her, they really didn't know what to do. Eggheads talked about listing her under SCP, and they had a cell ready for her, nice and warm. Wrote up containment procedures and everything. Then Dr. Gears submitted a report, saying how her system was 'inefficient,' and 'had room for improvement.' Motherfucker.\"</p>\n<p>Scud started nodding quickly, tapping the table. \u201cShit, I remember that!\" the younger Agent interjected. \"They were all worked up, brain-machine interface research or something. They kept feeding her to 212, then working on her in the lab, crossing her with every mechanical or cybernetic SCP they could think of.\u201d He rubbed his face, trying to remember. \u201cGod, how many times did they do that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTwelve. They fed her to 212 twelve times. Not counting all the 'regular' surgery stuff they did as well. 212 did less and less every time. Finally, it wouldn't trigger anymore. It\u2026 it didn't see her as human. She had a bit of a breakdown when that happened. It took God knows how many sessions with Glass before she stabilized from her suicidal tendencies. After that, there wasn't much more to do. They'd hit the limit with what they could do with her. We kept thinking they'd end up just dissecting her. Maybe they would have. But then that whole thing with Able went pear-shaped.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"Able?\" Scud asked.</p>\n<p>\"Remember Pandora's Box? Mobile Task Force Omega Seven? Remember how they kept talking about how they were going to use SCPs to fight SCPs?\"</p>\n<p>\"I remember it went completely to shit. The idea was fucking stupid,\" Scud said.</p>\n<p>\"No, it wasn't. The idea was solid. They just chose the wrong SCP to do it with.\"</p>\n<p>Scud sipped his coffee in silence as Harken opened the file folder, leafing through the contents and nodding at what he found there. Scud cleared his throat. \u201cSo. Where did you figure in?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harken gave a short, bitter laugh as he carefully examined one of the photos, holding it up to the light to get a better look. \u201cMe? They found me in a bottle at the Site 17 training center. Mental health restriction. My team got carved up by 106. I was the only survivor. I kinda snapped after that, worthless in the field, but I know the spy game inside and out. Some personality profile system decided my skillset meshed well with Kramer. Myself, I think they just wanted to pair her up with someone who wouldn't be missed. Not that they use us much. Maybe the whole Able thing spooked them, but until Site 17 got hit, we weren't doing any work at all. Now, of course, we're busy busy busy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scud grinned, rising from his chair and pulling on his still damp coat. \u201cWell, you're doing good work. Word on the street is you've got MC&amp;D running scared. Keep it up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"Thanks.\"</p>\n<p>\"No problem. Be seeing you.\"</p>\n<p>Harken nodded, leaning back in his chair as Scud walked to the door. He coughed. \u201cHey, Scud?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow long you been on the take?\u201d</p>\n<p>Scud stopped, one hand on the doorknob, half turning to Harken.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere's a secured message on the sheet,\" Harken said. He held up one of the photos, revealing a series of small pinholes punched through the eight by ten glossy. \"How many of our agents did you sell out since you started taking money from Marshall, Carter and Dark?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh come on,\u201d Scud laughed, \u201cyou're pulling my-\u201d</p>\n<p>Even silenced, Harken's pistol sounded like a firecracker in the still apartment. A gout of blood sprayed from Scud's back. He croaked, falling to the floor, his own pistol falling from nerveless fingers and clattering against the stained hardwood floor. \"You were right about one thing,\" Harken said. \"The day I shot you was the day you retired.\"</p>\n<p>A semi-truck driving by drowned out the next four shots Harken fired into Scud's chest. \"Well, I guess that's done wi\u2014\"</p>\n<p>The bedroom door came off its hinges as Kramer smashed through it like a freight train. She had her sidearm in both hands, eyes glowing as they scanned for threats, her bare musculature twitching and soaked with synthetic adrenaline. \u201cW't the f'k is goin' on?!\u201d she shouted, in a voice still fuzzy with sleep.</p>\n<p>Harken chuckled, wiping off his gun. \u201cYou've never been a morning person. Relax, it was just Scud. He turned traitor a while ago, and they were waiting for a good time to bump him, so they sent him to us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kramer nodded, visibly relaxing, her snarled and sweaty hair turning her hyperaggressive pose into a caricature. \u201cI heard you two talking. What was it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harken looked at her, then to Scud. \"He's dead. What does it matter now?\u201d</p>\n<p>She nodded absently, already stumbling back to bed.</p>\n<p>They left Scud there when they rolled out the next day. A little surprise for the next team.</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/reflections\">Reflections</a>\" by Dr Gears, from the <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

I've never really heard much about her, besides jokes and the whole supersoldier bit.\u201d\n\n\n\nHarken stared, then shook his head. \u201cSupersoldier, huh? She's not a supersoldier, she's a\u2026\u201d He paused, put an ear to the door. The only sound was the low buzzing noise of Kramer's cybernetic components undergoing their usual regenerative cycle.\n\n\n\nHarken leaned in, lowering his voice. \u201cOk, here's the deal. She's not a supersoldier, or a war machine, or anything like that\u2026 not exactly. She grew up in the Church of The Broken God. Her parents were supposed to be some big so-and-sos in their clergy. They did things to her. I don't really know what: she doesn't talk about it much, but whatever it was, she almost died a few times. She lost her right eye, most of her right hand, her ears and most of her teeth.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou're bullshitting me.\u201d Scud said, a nervous laugh in his voice.\n\n\n\nHarken sipped his coffee, staring into the oily liquid. \u201cNo bullshit. Most likely they were coaching her to become a Crusader: one of their \"holy knights of the machine.\" Or maybe they were just seeing what they could do. Anyway, they changed her body chemistry, did stuff to her brain to make her totally compliant and loyal to the higher ups in the Church.. It was working great until some goons hired by Marshall, Carter and Dark raided them. One of their members wanted some 'relic' they had in the basement, so they hired out some people to go and trash them.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was a nightmare, from what she said.\u201d Harken continued. \"You know how she's all cold as ice and stuff? Well, even she gets the shakes talking about that night. They came right in the middle of a service. Shot some people, rounded up everyone else, all black masks and guns. They stole a bunch of stuff out of the vault, then lit the place on fire. She saw her parents, dead and bleeding on the steps to the podium. She never saw who shot them.\u201d He looked up, catching Scud's eyes. \u201cShe did see them get stacked up like cordwood near the door to make it look like they died trying to escape. Saw them start to burn as they dragged her out.\u201d\n\n\n\nScud stared in silence. Harken lit another cigarette. \u201cKramer was\u2026twelve, maybe thirteen? Barely a kid, but she saw the writing on the wall, did what she needed to do to survive. The mercs found her hiding in the sacristy. They almost put a bullet in her head, but then she told them she knew where the good stuff was, and how to get past the locks and traps and other shit like that. Mercs decided to take her back with them. They got a bonus for bringing her in.\"\n\n\n\n\"MC&D loved her, it was like getting a blank check for them. They started adding things. Subdermal armour, ocular implants, amputated and replaced her legs below the knee, tweaked organs, a real overhaul. They made it so she could change her facial bone structure at will. It apparently feels like having a truck run over your face. She had to practice twice daily.\"\n\n\n\n\u201cSo she worked for richie-rich for a while, lots of combat stuff, and some\u2026 \u201d Harken coughed, checking the dim bedroom again. \u201c\u2026 well. She's never been hard on the eyes, you know, and you know what they say: if it exists, someone will want to fuck it. Sometimes she mixed the two. A few very rich blokes who somehow pissed off MC&D got a razor in the neck while they were on the fly. Anyway, she did that for a while, then bumped into The Foundation during a breach event. She shot her handlers and turned herself over to the recovery Agents.\u201d\n\n\n\nHarken laughed, shaking his head. \u201cThose assholes came home feeling like they won the Super Bowl. Promotions all around. Almost lost her right off the bat: she had a stroke when they started to question her, some failsafe the richies had put in her brain. They got her working again, pumped her for information. After they squeezed her, they really didn't know what to do. Eggheads talked about listing her under SCP, and they had a cell ready for her, nice and warm. Wrote up containment procedures and everything. Then Dr. Gears submitted a report, saying how her system was 'inefficient,' and 'had room for improvement.' Motherfucker.\"\n\n\n\nScud started nodding quickly, tapping the table. \u201cShit, I remember that!\" the younger Agent interjected. \"They were all worked up, brain-machine interface research or something. They kept feeding her to 212, then working on her in the lab, crossing her with every mechanical or cybernetic SCP they could think of.\u201d He rubbed his face, trying to remember. \u201cGod, how many times did they do that?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cTwelve. They fed her to 212 twelve times. Not counting all the 'regular' surgery stuff they did as well. 212 did less and less every time. Finally, it wouldn't trigger anymore. It\u2026 it didn't see her as human. She had a bit of a breakdown when that happened. It took God knows how many sessions with Glass before she stabilized from her suicidal tendencies. After that, there wasn't much more to do. They'd hit the limit with what they could do with her. We kept thinking they'd end up just dissecting her. Maybe they would have. But then that whole thing with Able went pear-shaped.\u201d\n\n\n\n\"Able?\" Scud asked.\n\n\n\n\"Remember Pandora's Box? Mobile Task Force Omega Seven? Remember how they kept talking about how they were going to use SCPs to fight SCPs?\"\n\n\n\n\"I remember it went completely to shit. The idea was fucking stupid,\" Scud said.\n\n\n\n\"No, it wasn't. The idea was solid. They just chose the wrong SCP to do it with.\"\n\n\n\nScud sipped his coffee in silence as Harken opened the file folder, leafing through the contents and nodding at what he found there. Scud cleared his throat. \u201cSo. Where did you figure in?\u201d\n\n\n\nHarken gave a short, bitter laugh as he carefully examined one of the photos, holding it up to the light to get a better look. \u201cMe? They found me in a bottle at the Site 17 training center. Mental health restriction. My team got carved up by 106. I was the only survivor. I kinda snapped after that, worthless in the field, but I know the spy game inside and out. Some personality profile system decided my skillset meshed well with Kramer. Myself, I think they just wanted to pair her up with someone who wouldn't be missed. Not that they use us much. Maybe the whole Able thing spooked them, but until Site 17 got hit, we weren't doing any work at all. Now, of course, we're busy busy busy.\u201d\n\n\n\nScud grinned, rising from his chair and pulling on his still damp coat. \u201cWell, you're doing good work. Word on the street is you've got MC&D running scared. Keep it up.\u201d\n\n\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\n\n\n\"No problem. Be seeing you.\"\n\n\n\nHarken nodded, leaning back in his chair as Scud walked to the door. He coughed. \u201cHey, Scud?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHow long you been on the take?\u201d\n\n\n\nScud stopped, one hand on the doorknob, half turning to Harken.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere's a secured message on the sheet,\" Harken said. He held up one of the photos, revealing a series of small pinholes punched through the eight by ten glossy. \"How many of our agents did you sell out since you started taking money from Marshall, Carter and Dark?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh come on,\u201d Scud laughed, \u201cyou're pulling my-\u201d\n\n\n\nEven silenced, Harken's pistol sounded like a firecracker in the still apartment. A gout of blood sprayed from Scud's back. He croaked, falling to the floor, his own pistol falling from nerveless fingers and clattering against the stained hardwood floor. \"You were right about one thing,\" Harken said. \"The day I shot you was the day you retired.\"\n\n\n\nA semi-truck driving by drowned out the next four shots Harken fired into Scud's chest. \"Well, I guess that's done wi\u2014\"\n\n\n\nThe bedroom door came off its hinges as Kramer smashed through it like a freight train. She had her sidearm in both hands, eyes glowing as they scanned for threats, her bare musculature twitching and soaked with synthetic adrenaline. \u201cW't the f'k is goin' on?!\u201d she shouted, in a voice still fuzzy with sleep.\n\n\n\nHarken chuckled, wiping off his gun. \u201cYou've never been a morning person. Relax, it was just Scud. He turned traitor a while ago, and they were waiting for a good time to bump him, so they sent him to us.\u201d\n\n\n\nKramer nodded, visibly relaxing, her snarled and sweaty hair turning her hyperaggressive pose into a caricature. \u201cI heard you two talking. What was it?\u201d\n\n\n\nHarken looked at her, then to Scud. \"He's dead. What does it matter now?\u201d\n\n\n\nShe nodded absently, already stumbling back to bed.\n\n\n\nThey left Scud there when they rolled out the next day. A little surprise for the next team.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "licensing-guide", "licensing-master-list"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "broken-god", "doctor-gears", "game-day", "marshall-carter-and-dark", "tale"], "title": "Reflections - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/reflections", "year": 2011}, "relationskips": {"created_at": "2011-10-01T05:40:00", "creator": "DrEverettMann", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "DrEverettMann", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dreverettmann", "comment": "Added tags: lombardi, love, tale.

He gazed at its window, specifically the writing on it that said \"O5-7\". He took a breath in, then kicked it.</p>\n<p>Jesus fuck, that hurt. But this obstacle would not get in the way of Rex Sponge, junior level researcher and herald of justice. He thrust back his leg again, ready to descend upon the door, when a noise interrupted him. It was a voice inside, telling him to come in. Rex paused, in thought, then shrugged and opened the door.</p>\n<p>\"You know, most people knock more than once when they want to enter. You're lucky I heard you.\" The voice came from a middle-aged man seated at a desk at the end of the office, sitting down and shuffling through papers.</p>\n<p>\"O5-7, your time is up, or should I call you\u2026 Data!\" Rex gave a menacing stare at the man.</p>\n<p>The man looked up. \"What?\"</p>\n<p>\"Don't toy with me, 'O5-7', if that is your real name! You and I both know you're a technopath!\" Rex took a step forward, his hand at his waist, ready to draw a pistol.</p>\n<p>\"What the fuck are you talking about?\" The man gave Rex a look of confusion.</p>\n<p>\"Don't use your mind tricks on me, bender!\" Rex drew his gun, pointing it at the man.</p>\n<p>\"Wait, if I'm a technopath, how could I- You know what, never mind. What the hell is wrong with you?\" The man gave Rex a look.</p>\n<p>\"Playing stupid will get you nowhere!\"</p>\n<p>The man sighed, and began to reach for a small, green button at the edge of his desk. Rex pulled the trigger. The man didn't even flinch as he pressed the button. Rex jumped out of the way, expecting the floor to open up beneath himself into a pit of keter-class solar babies.</p>\n<p>\"Security personnel will be here in a few mi- Did you try to shoot me!?\" The man looked like he was about to laugh. \"Did you not fucking notice the bullet-proof glass in front of my desk.\"</p>\n<p>Rex had indeed failed to notice, being too focused on the corrupt demon sitting before him. Looking up now he could see a small mark left by his bullet that would probably have hit the ceiling anyways.</p>\n<p>\"B-but\u2026 you control 682\u2026\" Rex looked shocked. How could he not have foreseen such a devious trick?</p>\n<p>\"What the hell are you talking about? We're trying to <em>destroy</em> 682. He's a huge drain of our resources and kills a lot of D-class personnel. It's such a shame to see their lives go to waste like that.\"</p>\n<p>\"A-ha! So you think human lives are disposable!\" Rex lifted his hand in triumph.</p>\n<p>\"What? No. Are you fucking stupid?

What, you think <em>I</em> think this is just some big game?\"</p>\n<p>\"But\u2026 what about when you created the Factory, and the Chaos Insurgency made 173 O5-1, and\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"Are you high?

He waited for the guard to leave, then swiveled his chair around. A small, white cat leaped out from a high shelf and landed on his lap, although only half of its body was visible.

Why don't we use Rex Sponge against her?\" O5-7 looked around. \"We'll simply abuse the obedience collars like we always do and have him kill her.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's totally mental!\" 173 exclaimed, \"I love it. Let's 'ave a jolly ol' time fuckin' with the bugger.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes. This will end nicely. Muhahahaha.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Agent Johnson looked at Rex. \"And\u2026 and that's why you killed Breanne? Because the O5s used mind control on you?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, yes, of course. They're all evil you see. Could you loosen these restraints?\"</p>\n<p>\"And\u2026 173 is British?\"</p>\n<p>\"Duh.

O5-7 wakes up from\u00a0\u00a0the slam of the door, leaving a puddle of drool on the desk. He looks around and slowly brushes his, long, curled moustache. His eyes suddenly set on the intruder at the door.\n\n\n\n\"Ah, so Rex, you have finally come!\" O5-7 lifts an eyebrow and smirks, then rubs his hands together.\n\n\n\n\"Yes, your reign of cruelty is over, O5 dash 7, or should I call you... 'Data'!\" Rex snarls and gazes at the man, aiming his pistol at the villain's head.\n\n\n\n\"Ah, so you figured it out, did you? That I am actually an SCP, a technopath?\" Data giggles madly.\n\n\n\n\"And that you've been controlling that reptile the whole time!\"\n\n\n\n\"Ah, yes, 682 is a prize.\" Data giggles again. \"But did you know I - I mean we - made him! That we made all the SCPs?\"\n\n\n\n\"Of course I did - I'm Rex Sponge!\" Rex flips his hair. The poor and discomforting lighting of the room somehow makes it glisten. \"Ever since you created and broke up with the Factory, Chaos Insurgency, ORIA, and Global Occult Coalition, you've never stopped abusing Class-D's for your own nefarious deeds!\"\n\n\n\n\"Then you know that 173 is actually O5-1?\" Data seems shocked at Rex's knowledge of Foundation history.\n\n\n\n\"Yes, and now your time is up!\" Rex takes another step forward.\n\n\n\n\"Ah, but how do you expect to deal with... a tank of 231-7 offspring that we've been secretly breeding?\" Data's hand begins to descend upon a large, red button on his desk.\n\n\n\n\"Your time is over!\" Rex shoots Data's right hand. The technopath screams and pulls back his hand.\n\n\n\n\"Data, consider yourself Rex Sponged!\" Rex pulls the trigger and a red dot suddenly appears on Data's head, which begins overflowing with blood. The O5 collapses into the chair, dead.\n\n\n\nRex takes a list out of his pocket and crosses a name off. One dead, eleven to go.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nOr, wait, would it be 14? Rex shook his head out of his day-dream. Now was no time for lolly-gagging. Now was the time for action.

Atop said computer was a certain statue of a certain monkey, which many people had tried to obtain. Around him stood, sat, or otherwise existed quite a large number of the junior staff, with a few seniors, all eyes glued to the good doctor.</p>\n<p>\"And\u2026save. There we go. The entirety of site 19, backed up, and emailed elsewhere, so if this goes as balls up as I expect it to, we can reboot.\" He sighed, and stood up. \"In that case, I officially declare the beginning of the Staff Prank war of 2011. Whoever holds 050 at the end of a 24 hour period will be promoted to the ranks of Senior Staff. I currently hold it, so y'all can start by pranking me\u2026 May god have mercy on all our souls.\"</p>\n<p>\u2026And then the bomb under his chair detonated, covering the cafeteria with lime green paint, and incidentally blowing his legs off in the process. Several rooms away, research assistant Renfield took her fingers out of her ears and looked happily down at the monkey statue now gracing her new desk.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Dmitri studied his reflection for a moment, adjusted the angle of his hat, then exited his quarters. The heel irons in his boots clicked on the linoleum floors as he walked briskly through the halls of Site 19. Those going about their daily business knew to stay out of the way when Strelnikov was about; his movements had purpose, and that could only mean a disaster was looming.</p>\n<p>Indeed it was. Renfield's office was only two floors down from his own.</p>\n<p>Before he even knew it, he was reading the nametag on her door. Or rather, he was reading her name amongst a list of other assistants who shared this office. As he kicked the door off its hinges, he decided it didn't really matter whose office it was. His boots left dents in the sheet metal as he stepped over the broken door and surveyed the group of cowering interns, hand resting casually on his holster.</p>\n<p>\"Which ones of you is Rend Field.\" No answer.</p>\n<p>\"I WILL SHOOT ONE OF YOU EVERY MINUTE UNTIL I AM TOLD WHICH ONES OF YOU IS REND FIELD.\" The group parted like the Red Sea, leaving a smug looking young girl standing alone in the center. Dmitri's teeth shone as he growled at her.</p>\n<p><strong>TWO HOURS LATER</strong></p>\n<p>\"SON OF THE BITCH, JACK. GOD DAMMIT.\"</p>\n<p>\"Dmitri, you can't just shoot whoever is holding the monkey and expect to get it. That isn't a prank.\" Bright's wheelchair bumped into the back of Dmitri's leg as he manhandled it around. \"And get out of the damn way.\"</p>\n<p>Dmitri jabbed a finger at Bright. \"IT IS A PRANK. I HAVE DONE THIS PRANK SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE, IN BOTH WARS.\"</p>\n<p>\"It's not a prank, Dmitri.\"</p>\n<p>\"YES IT IS!\"</p>\n<p>\"Dmitri. It's over. You're out of the competition now, for good. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go deal with Renfield in the infirmary\u2026.smug little bitch. You could have at least killed her.\"</p>\n<p>Strelnikov sighed heavily and returned to the quiet of his quarters, trying to reconcile himself to the fact that 050 would never be his.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Agent Lament whistled quietly to himself, glancing down at his watch, nodding amiably to the nurse as she walked into Renfield's room carrying an IV bag of saline. Lament smirked slightly and started walking down the hallway, heading toward his extremely messy office and waiting outside the door.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Renfield moaned in her sleep, the drugs having her knocked out completely. The nurse hooked up the IV bag, checked the prone woman's vitals, and left the room. Within three minutes Renfield's skin started to develop large, round hives, then her neck and throat started to swell as a severe allergic reaction set in, followed by her eyes shooting open as the stimulants hit her bloodstream. She tried to scream but couldn't, her throat beginning to close as she desperately hit the call button again and again and again\u2026</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Lament opened his door, looking into his office and smiling slightly at the statue. Now\u2026 How the hell could he get rid of it before someone noticed that he had it?</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Few people had a true appreciation for just how ingrained computers were with every single aspect of modern society, and the Foundation was no exception. Despite all the hard copies, every report, every researcher's note, every field log and every file photo was logged into a computer database somewhere. Every personnel transfer, every requisition form, every security feed, all set up in little 0's and 1's on a hard drive somewhere. When the transfer of Site 19's backup set off some alarms, he knew it was time. Kap - a name adopted because he was sick of people mispronouncing his full name - was sitting and typing away deep in the bowels of the Site. The coders and hardware gurus had a whole, unique set of regulations and security clearances, and the amount of information you were exposed to above your classification level was directly proportional to your time on the job. The guys that ran the networks and made sure the workstations functioned knew more than most of the researchers, though maybe not as much as that one janitor.</p>\n<p>Once he realized that a mixed batch of saline and known allergens could only be used for the ever-escalating prank contests, a few key strokes were all it took to set retaliation in motion. A series of embedded programs ticked off other protocols which activated further batch processes. The sheer array of false IPs and bogus addresses would take the average user months to back-trace, and any of the other computer staff were already well-bribed with beer, pizza, and the promise of a neat and orderly work area. Lament opened the door to his office, seeing a single, solitary box laying there, carefully gift-wrapped and tied with a neat bow. It wasn't even close to his birthday, but there was no way any sort of bomb or other device could have made it that deep into a secure Foundation site, so he took it inside and opened it up.</p>\n<p>Kap was as surprised as anyone when the little monkey appeared on top of his computer tower, and sighed slightly at the poor devil who was going to have to treat Lament and clean up the hundreds of tiny insects from his office. After all, the present was bees.</p>\n<hr/>\n<blockquote>\n<p>INCIDENT 2011-\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>T-330 minutes<br/>\nResearcher Eisenberg seen carrying a set of mechanic tattooing equipment, origin unknown</p>\n<p>T-310 minutes<br/>\nResearcher Eisenberg seen entering the enclosure of SCP-1006, carrying a bucket, a stack of papers, and his personal copies of Assorted Writings of V.I.

A 1:3 greyscale full body portrait of V.I.Lenin can be seen on his back, and a text later identified as the entire text of \"State and Revolution\" in 8\u00a0pt. font covering his chest, abdomen, and both thighs.</p>\n<p>T+20 minutes<br/>\nDesk of Researcher Eisenberg [REDACTED], markedly improving the filing order.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<p>Dr. Los E. R. checked the sign again. Eisenberg's office was room\u2026321? No, wait, 312. He set off at a brisk pace down the hallway, hoping to get there before anyone else did.</p>\n<p>309, 310, 311\u2026There we go, 312. Los E. R. gave a quick knock and pushed the door open without waiting for a reply. Researcher Eisenberg visibly balked at the sudden intrusion, his eyes darting to the statue on his desk before reaching for the top drawer.</p>\n<p>\"Whoa whoa whoa! Calm down, I'm not going to do anything!\" Los E. R. held his palms out. \"See? Sorry, didn't think you'd be so jumpy.\"</p>\n<p>Eisenberg stopped, eyeing the doctor warily, but kept his hand resting on the top drawer. \"What do you want?\"</p>\n<p>\"Word around the site is that you got 1006 to net Kap. Just wanted to say, that's brilliant! No one ever expects nets!\" Los E. R. chuckled to himself. \"Oh, don't worry about me. I'm not going to pull some horrendous prank. I'd probably end up in the hospital, I've never been really good at elaborate pranks.\"</p>\n<p>Eisenberg seemed to relax slightly at Los E. R.'s reassurance, but wasn't totally swayed. \"No, it wasn't nets, exactly\u2026I had them tattoo Lenin on him.\"</p>\n<p>Los E. R. burst out laughing, leaning on the desk for support. \"You had them <em>tattoo</em> a portrait of <em>Lenin?!</em> That's genius! How does someone come up with something like that?! Oh man, I'd never pull something like that off, I'm no good with those elaborate pranks. Did you actually talk to those little commies yourself?\"</p>\n<p>Eisenberg smiled and chuckled nervously. \"Yeah, it wasn't too hard to get them to agree. I mean, it <em>was</em> Lenin after all. Talking to a bunch of spiders though\u2026that was kinda creepy. They were all over the place.\"</p>\n<p>\"I can tell. You've got a cobweb on your coat, here let me\u2026\" Los E. R. reached forward and scratched at Eisenbergs lapel. On instinct, he glanced down to catch a glimpse of the bit of silk wafting from his collar, only to get a flick on the nose.</p>\n<p>\"Gotcha.\"</p>\n<p>Stunned, he watched as Los E. R. laughed one more time before he scooped SCP-050 from his desk and exited the room. As he disappeared around the door frame, Eisenberg heard him chuckle.</p>\n<p>\"Never was any good with those elaborate pranks.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"Hey, Los.\"</p>\n<p>Los E. R. felt a chill run down his spine at the voice. \"Oh no,\" he whimpered. \"Not HIM\u2026\"</p>\n<p>He turned around, clutching the monkey statue to his chest, as a breathtakingly ugly middle-aged man walked down the hall towards him. \"Relax,\" Clef said. \"I don't want that statue. I'm already senior staff, and I have no interest in Bright's games. You're safe from me.\"</p>\n<p>Los E. R. sighed in relief. \"Oh, thank god,\" he said. \"I really did not want to be subject to a prank by you.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hey, don't worry about it. I'm beyond that sort of bullshit anyway. I always thought that stuff was kinda stupid. In fact, as a sign of my goodwill, I'll escort you back to your office.\"</p>\n<p>Los E. R. quickly followed Clef down the hallway. It was amazing, he thought, what the presence of that man could do. A researcher leaped out from around the corner holding a giant creme pie, which he rapidly put down and walked away from. A man wearing a hockey mask and holding a machete took off his costume and had a sheepish talk with the Senior Researcher. It was wonderful.</p>\n<p>\"Well, here we are,\" Clef said.</p>\n<p>Los E. R. looked up at the door and frowned. \"This isn't my office,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"What? Oh, oops. Sorry. 571, not 517. Let's go.\"</p>\n<p>Clef led the junior staff member to the other side of the floor, and to his office. \"Well, here we are\u2026 again,\" he said, a few minutes later.</p>\n<p>\"Thanks a lot, Dr. Clef,\" Los E. R. said. \"I really appreciate it.\"</p>\n<p>\"No problem. Oh, Los? Remember when I said I had no interest in Bright's games?\" Clef grinned, a huge, evil, sinister grin. \"I lied.\"</p>\n<p>That was when the door of Los' office exploded outward, and five thousand gallons of compressed shaving cream flooded the hallway.</p>\n<p>Clef watched Los being carried away in the avalanche of white foam, and wiped a little spot off his jacket. \"Go get em', Adams,\" he murmured.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Ed from Accounting (everyone thought of him as \"Ed from Accounting\" \u2014 including himself after 14 years at the job) hated the prank wars. A waste of staff time, the building maintenance budget, and the cost of injuries, if you asked him\u2026which no one did. The usual threats \u2014 paperwork, budget cuts, audits \u2014 never seemed to work. More creative means were called for.</p>\n<p>Ed called Junior Researcher Johnson. \"Is it ready? \u2026 really? Good! Bring it around to my office.\"</p>\n<p>Fifteen minutes later, Johnson was in Ed's dingy, cluttered office, handing him a small brown bag. Ed looked in the bag and smiled. \"How long will it stay that way?\"</p>\n<p>\"Weeks\" Johnson replied. \"at least, if no one touches it.\"</p>\n<p>Ed put the bag in his briefcase, along with a small stack of papers. 12:20? Good. Adams would be off to lunch. He headed up to her office.</p>\n<p>Ed knocked on the door, then let himself in. Good, no one there. It was easy to swap the item on Adams' desk for the one in the bag. He slipped the Form 1661-G under the inner door for Dr. Clef. That would excuse his visit; the auditors really did need it next week.</p>\n<p>Back downstairs in his office, Ed opened a file cabinet and dropped SCP-050, still in its bag, next to the 2004 Operating Budget reports. It looked like someone's long-forgotten lunch. He didn't care the least bit about \"winning\" it \u2014 he just wanted it out of circulation.</p>\n<p>No one would guess that he had the wit to obtain it.<br/>\nNo one would guess that he had pulled this particular prank, since he wasn't supposed to have any access to SCPs.<br/>\nNo one ever came down to Accounting if they could help it.<br/>\nSCP-050 would be there for a long time.</p>\n<p>When they found the fake, they would blame Johnson, who had shown some real success in training SCP-157.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Research Assistant Reject was having a nice, calm day, sipping his coffee and skimming through his newest batch of paperwork while strolling down the hallway to his office. He was called Reject for a very good reason: although he had been a member of the Foundation for ten years, he had been the same rank for over seven of them. He even called himself Reject. His bachelorhood had hopelessly dragged on much longer than he had ever hoped. He was used to being a reject. That was, until he spotted a man in a suit walking into Dr. Clef's office.</p>\n<p>Reject was never known as an especially observant person, but today was different. He had heard about some pranks going on, but he didn't really care about any of that. He was determined to work his way up the ladder without shaving cream or explosives, just with hard work and dedication. Until he saw a very happy man running out of Dr. Clef's office, his arms crossed upon his chest. Reject could see a brown paper bag bobbing slightly above and below the man's arms. His interest piqued, Reject decided to follow him.</p>\n<p>The man never turned around as he walked. Reject didn't have any trouble following him. Ten minutes later, Reject realized just how far they had walked. He turned his head. \"Accounting \u2014&gt;\" was written on a sign, pointing in the direction that he was going. After another couple of minutes, the man turned sharply into an office. Reject peeked into the room to see another man converse shortly with the man he had followed and take the bag. Reject ducked behind a corner as both men exited the office.</p>\n<p>Reject attempted to follow the man with the bag, but lost him in the maze of cubicles and offices in this unknown sector. Reject turned to leave, but decided not to let this go. This chance was his. He called up an old friend from Sector 28 with a favor to ask. His friend agreed, and in an hour, Reject knew that he would have the chance to become a Senior Staff member. He went to his office and placed an empty coffee mug alongside a mostly unread folder of paperwork.</p>\n<p>One hour later, Reject met his friend in the cafeteria. Reject's friend handed him a bag with two words written on it. \"DON'T LOSE.\" Reject smiled, and walked briskly down towards the accounting offices. Once there, he took the item out of the bag. Staring at a sentient calculator was a new experience for him. After befriending SCP-168, he asked his new buddy a favor. The calculator agreed in return for the ability to see the rest of the prank war. Reject dropped SCP-168 in the office he had seen before as soon as the man inhabiting it left. Reject admired his handiwork. He took a seat on a nearby chair. When the man returned, he gave Reject a questioning glance, but dismissed it. After five minutes in his office, a scream was heard. When the man exited his office, his face was pale white. In his hand was SCP-168.</p>\n<p>The man looked at the calculator and said \"Okay, okay. I'll go get it. I didn't realize the world would end if I didn't! I feel so awful\u2026\" Reject chuckled to himself and began to shadow the man as he hurried down the hallways. When they arrived at a file cabinet, the man stopped. He ran his finger along the cabinet until he reached \"2004 Operating Budget Reports Jan-Mar.\" He started typing on the calculator. After a short period, the calculator responded. The man jumped back, aghast. He yelped \"No! I brought you to the stupid monkey! That can't be!\" Reject quickly decided he'd had enough of complaining from this unknown man and dealt a swift uppercut to the jaw followed by an elbow to the nose. As he fell, Reject grabbed SCP-168 and the brown paper bag. Overjoyed, he began to walk back to his office. He looked once more at the unconscious accountant on the ground. And then he laughed, and left this bloody, deceptive business behind him as he strolled back towards his office with a renewed sense of confidence.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"Nevah let practicality stand in de way of <em>art</em>, my cousin.\" The humongously fat Hawaiian nodded ponderously at the uniformed corpse held aloft in his hand, then slowly shook it so that it's head nodded along. Chuckling to himself, he slipped the matchbook the poor guard had died failing to protect into an outer pocket of his enormous satchel next to a tarnished canteen, and waddled out of the ruined containment unit and down the hallway toward the personnel wing.</p>\n<p>Flanked by a pair of traitor guards, their sleeves rolled up to reveal liberty cuffs emblazoned with blaring abstract designs, the huge man reflected on the work and planning that had gone into this effort. It <em>was</em> impractical, sure. Infiltrating the Foundation's security forces alone had taken months. Fortunately, the prank war was a regular yearly event, so he'd had plenty of time to prepare.</p>\n<p>\"Ah, here it tis.\"</p>\n<p>He stopped in front of a particular office, grinning as he began pulling the necessary materials from his satchel. A small funnel, a length of tubing, the matchbox and canteen, and hundreds of small paper packets, which his helpers began opening one by one.</p>\n<p>It didn't take long to tape the tubing to the mouth of the canteen, and slide the other end under the door. It took only a little longer to funnel the contents of the packets into the gap, and considerably less to open the matchbook and slide it in as well before sealing the gap completely with more tape. Once their work was done, the big man rose and nodded to his companions, then paused to doodle a small cartoon on the door before heading back down the hallway they'd come in by and leave the facility.</p>\n<p>Later that day, as loyal security men tried desperately to work out what had happened to SCP's 649 and 109, Reject arrived at his office to find a scribbled caricature on his door of a fat man in a bowler hat giving him the finger, with the text \"PRANKED BY BRUDDAH GROVE! Are We Cool Yet?\".</p>\n<p>Reject had just enough time to curse before the door burst and he was swamped by a massive wave of lime jello.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Dr. Los E. R. dug a finger in his ear, trying to dig out the last vestiges of shaving cream. He winced as the dried bits twisted painfully before crumbling lose. Site 19 was a maze on the best of days, and on Senior Staff Shenanigans day it was a minefield. He rerouted around the third floor; he had heard that someone had gotten their hands on a metric ton of hissing cockroaches and thermite. He skirted the south side of the fourth floor, trying to find his way back to the restrooms to wash up. If memory served, it was at the end of the hall on his right, next door to where they put Research Assistant Reject after he somehow managed to shrink his office to a third of its original size.</p>\n<p>He was scrapping dried flakes of cream from his lower back when he noticed he what he was walking in. Quizzically, he raised a foot to get a better look. Smells a little like lime, kind of minty. Looks like some kind of green\u2026slime? He glanced down the hallway and saw Reject, lying in a puddle of the stuff. He was either out cold, or dea-</p>\n<p>Los E. R.'s heart skipped a beat as he put two and two together.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:1.5em;\">\"DEAD BODIES!!!\"</span></p>\n<p>Screaming incoherently, Dr. Los E. R. hurtled back the way he came, sticky green jello foot prints marking his progress to the nearest <a href=\"/scp-447\">SCP-447</a> alarm.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Bruddah Grove paused as the klaxon sounded. Blast doors slid into place over the exit. How poetic, so close to freedom with artifacts of power. With the dead security guard he had been dragging along, he waved at his companion.</p>\n<p>\"Dis noise, have they figured out what we are doing?\"</p>\n<p>The traitorous guard shook his head, the blood draining from his face. \"That's the 447 alert. They've locked the exits. They're going to detonate the on-site warhead.\"</p>\n<p>There was a full moment of silence.</p>\n<p>Carefully picking each word, Bruddah Grove looked at the tiny man.</p>\n<p>\"How doh we get out den?\"</p>\n<p>The two guards looked at each other nervously. \"We don't. We could try to get to the O5 bunker, but we can't make it from here. It's fifty levels down-\"</p>\n<p>\"Wait!\" The other guard perked up. \"The Site septic tank! I know that they've started reenforcing them ever since Bright accidentally flushed 523. It might be able to withstand the blast!\"</p>\n<p>\"The Sewage Access Hatch isn't far from here, we can make it if we hurry!\"</p>\n<p>Taking the slim glimmer of hope for what ever it was worth, the trio hurried desperately down the hall.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>O5-8 sighed. This was not the first time the 447 alert had been sounded on Senior Staff Shenanigans Day. Before flipping the switch and killing everyone on-site, he took a moment to make sure it was a dead body. If it wasn't, no harm done. If it was, well\u2026the nuke wouldn't do any good, anyways.</p>\n<p>A quick check later confirmed that Research Assistant Reject was not, in fact, dead. Perhaps more importantly, it turned out that it wasn't even 447 slime at all. With an irritated grumble, he switched of the klaxon. This prank war was stupid.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Bruddah Grove sat in the filth of the entire Site, watching his two companions float face down in the lanterns pale light. He might be here for a while, and they were using up too much air. He reflected on how their lungs filled with filth and life drained from their bodies, a testament to how life starts pure and ignorance weighs innocence down with shit. A haiku rose unbidden from his lips.</p>\n<p>\"Here I stew in filth,<br/>\nWaiting for the Bombs Big Boom.<br/>\nNow, Are We Cool Yet?\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Dr. Los E. R. felt rather silly. Of course it was another prank. He should have known. It probably wasn't even meant for him.</p>\n<p>Having long since given up hope of finding a bathroom to clean up in, he had started to work his way back to his office. Pushing the door open, a bucket of water immediately fell from atop the door. Irritated yet strangely grateful to get some kind of wash, he lifted the rim of the bucket to find the monkey sitting on his desk.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Junior Researcher Byantara had prepared a whole week in advance for this day. With Senior Staff position at stake, there was no reason not to be prepared. Crazy prepared, in his case.</p>\n<p>Six days, thirteen hours, forty-five minutes and nine seconds ago, Byantara was profusely apologising to a very unamused Doctor Crow, surrounded by the products of twenty-three very startled Malayan Stink Badgers which had now escaped their cages and were clawing the wallpaper off Doctor Crow's office. Long story short, it was yet another round of maintenance duty for him.</p>\n<p>Four days, seven hours, two minutes and fifty-five seconds ago, Byantara began painting the offices on the third floor of Block 2A, by himself, using two paint rollers, a crate of white paint, a box of plaster, a crate of tomatoes, and several dozen rolled-up meters of ultra-thin semi-permeable tubing.</p>\n<p>Two days, twelve hours, thirty-seven minutes and thirty-two seconds ago, a parcel arrived for Site-19, sealed with black tape and hastily recovered from designated post box PO-2354 by a certain shifty-looking Junior Researcher sent to collect the daily personal mail.</p>\n<p>One day, two hours, and exactly forty-nine seconds ago, Byantara finished his lab work, packed up, cleaned Chamber 2A-2-1 and secured several large marital aids to the floor before locking up. He proceeded similarly for Chamber 2A-2-3, -2-5, -2-7 and -2-9, and left the building with a little smile. Now, all that was left was to hope someone in Block 2A actually managed to get hold of 050.</p>\n<p>One hour, three minutes and twenty-one seconds ago, he idly browsed through the frantically compiled digital record of SCP-050 possession. Soon it would arrive. From Bright, to Clef, to Reject\u2026</p>\n<p>Byantara refreshed the page, spat out his acrid coffee, and dashed out of the lab. In his right hand was a remote, with a single green button, and he mashed it in double time to his steps towards the central communications office. Tucked in safely mere inches above the ceiling of Doctor Los's freshly painted office, forty-eight plastic phalluses began to hum.</p>\n<p>As expected, not only was the comms office a very long distance away, it was also utter chaos. Someone had sounded some sort of alarm beforehand, and whoever was meant to be guarding the place were long gone, leaving dog-eared papers in their wake. Chuckling to himself, he called up the speaker of Office 2A-3-5.</p>\n<p>Five seconds. Four seconds. Byantara cleared his throat. Three. The collective vibrations caused by the forty-eight sex toys would be building up to the maximum by now, shaking the ceiling - and walls - of every office on the floor below it, rupturing the many little sachets of tomato juice seeded in the plaster beneath the apple-scented white paint. Two.</p>\n<p>Junior Researcher Byantara took a deep breath. One.</p>\n<p>In his office, Doctor Los E. R. cowered beneath his desk as the walls began to bleed and the ceiling screamed his name. He was too busy wetting his pants to notice SCP-050 disappear from his office, later to be found in the locker of Junior Researcher Byantara.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"Bloody Los\u2026 Surprised that even worked as a prank\u2026 \" Researcher Eisenberg sat at his desk, absentmindedly stroking Nastasia, his linen cat. \"I'll teach him to cut the latin\u2026wait, that's an idea.\".<br/>\nResearcher Eisenberg rushed out of his office, and returned rather sweaty, holding a heavy Latin dictionary. Work has just begun.</p>\n<p>About an hour later - languages weren't exactly his strong side - Researcher Eisenberg arrived into the containment cell of SCP-758, with a sheet of paper heavily worn out with eraser marks. It might have been his imagination, but it seemed that upon seeing it, Vasili let out a sigh before introducing an ample amount of corrections. A glance at the current tally showed him however, that the statue has changed owners several times since he started his preparations, currently residing at the desk of some no-name Junior Researcher\u2026 whose name was actually rather lengthy. \"Byan-ta-ra\u2026 bloody hell, and I thought my surname was unwieldy.\" Researcher Eisenberg sighed and took out a pencil.</p>\n<p>\"Bloody hell, hope this ink is black enough\u2026\" His sweaty hands grabbed the worn leather of SCP-141, an act that would make many a bibliophile cringe, and he began to laboriously scribble onto the first free page, trying to imitate the original writing as well as possible. \"..e-ra-tio \u2026 that should be it\". Shaking with expectation, he ran to the nearest internet-enabled terminal.<br/>\nA quick search, and even quicker email from a disposable address later, Vladim. A. Eisenberg, in his mind already a Senior Researcher, walked back to his office.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Sitting at his desk, Junior Researcher Byantara was enjoying the fruit of a day's work - SCP-050 stood on his surprisingly clean table, and if it was his lucky day, he might just about be among the few Foundation employees to ever skip a rank. \"Wonder if Los has caught them all\u2026 he's lucky there isn't 151.. I wonder if the big one counts as Sn-\"<br/>\nHis thoughts were interrupted by a kick into the door, and in the next moment, he had to take cover behind his desk from a hail of bullets, accompanied by an even stronger hail of high-fidelity Russian swearing. A desk that the monkey statue has conveniently disappeared from.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Earlier\u2026</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To: <span class=\"wiki-email\">gro.pcs|vokinlertsad#gro.pcs|vokinlertsad</span><br/>\nFrom: <span class=\"wiki-email\">moc.rotaniliam|detimilnu_sexnyl#moc.rotaniliam|detimilnu_sexnyl</span><br/>\nSubject: Take a look at who you work with, Dimitri<br/>\nJunior Researcher Byantara is an interesting man, isn't it?<br/>\nwww.cnn.com/2011/11/15/Europe/scientist-accused-of-aiding-chechen-terrorists/index.html</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<p>Researcher Eisenberg prepared himself a cup of tea, and against all rules of hygiene, kissed the small statue, which responded by giving him a mild electric shock.<br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">-</span>-</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\" Hey buddy, I see no one has bothered to come see you today. I'm sorry for that, alot of shi..stuff has been going on ,but it's fun stuff. You know what a prank is? Good, you wanna help me with one? Oh don't worry no one will get hurt, and here have some MnMs. Tasty aren't they? You wanna help me now. That's great! Here's the plan.\"</p>\n<p>As he watched the gelatinous form move from the room, a smile formed on Junior Researcher Tad's face. It was his time to shine for once. It was luck that he walked by Eisenberg's office just in time to see the statue appear on his desk.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Eisenberg sipped at his tea, giving glances to his prize every few seconds. He also kept an eye on the door. Making sure that no fool would try to win the statue. If only he thought to check the airvent. As the orange form lowered down, it's pseudopods at the ready. Eisenberg looked up; Even with the strong smell of herbs in his nose he picked up another scent. The smell of the fur was indistinguishable to him, yet how could it be? As he turned around a high pitched squealed erupted followed by a shout.<br/>\n<strong>\"TICKLE WRESTLING!\"</strong><br/>\nThe statue appeared alongside Tad at his cubicle. He was going to enjoy the next few minutes, than probably regret getting involved in the first place. At least his desk looked organized for once.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>As Tad passed through an open door, the bucket teetering there fell forward, onto his head. Have you even had your entire head covered, not just in horse shit, but horse shit filled with horrible ideas? It's not a pleasant feeling. Luckily, Tad passed out before something horrible crawled out of SCP-100-J.</p>\n<p>Father Jakal looked up from his prayers, at the monkey statue which had appeared on his podium. A slight smile graced his lips. \"Fuck, i didn't think that'd really work!\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Dr Pullo Vorenus, Level 2 Researcher and Safe item specialist, paused as he walked past Site-19's nondenominational multipurpose chapel-crematorium-ossuary. As far as he could tell, priests didn't usually swear like that in church. At least, the priests back home hadn't. Except for Father Kowalski. When he was drunk. He poked his head in, and saw Father Jakal stroking a small statue. Then he ran to his small, shared office.</p>\n<p>After an hour or so of research, Doctor Vorenus was ready. He stopped by the Safe item storage lockers, and checked out a certain item, under the guise of \"additional research on the effects of the object when combined with religious exultation and <em>tagiatelle</em>\". A quick trip to the Site cafeteria, and the acquisition of some high-powered arc lights, and he was done. After telling the priest that his presence had been requested in the depths of the accounting department, he was ready to prepare.</p>\n<p>Father Jakal returned, still clutching the statue with a death grip. He seemed determined that nobody separate him from 050 from even a moment. As he entered the multipurpose nondenominational chapel-crematorium-ossuary, the door slammed shut and a heavenly light shone down on him from On High. He fell to his knees as a voice from Above called out into his mind, \"Father Jakal, thou hast been chosen.\" As he knelt gasping, trying to for a coherent sentence, the Voice continued, \"Thou shalt be My prophet on this earth. I shall show thee My true form, that thou may tell of Me to all thy fellows.\" The lights brightened, and Father Jakal shaded his eyes, cowering even further before the Lord his God. All the lights in the chapel shut off suddenly, and a form appeared above him in the rafters, lit from within. As he looked up, in full religious exultation, something fell onto his shoulder and slid to the floor with a <em>plop</em>. \"Thou hast been touched by My Noodly Appendage. Rejoice. And eat thy grains.\"</p>\n<p>Doctor Vorenus smiled, as he heard Father Jackal stomp out and call for a janitor. After putting the megaphone back in its locker, he returned to his shared office, and found his half meticulously cleaned. The precise line between the dirty and clean carpet might be hard to explain to his office-mate, but he was sure he could figure it out. After all, he was Doctor Pullo Vorenus, Level 2 Researcher, Safe Item Specialist, current owner of a small statue, and devout Pastafarian.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>It was an interesting day for Mess Hall 2. In the chaos of Prank Day, it had somehow transformed itself into both an eatery, sanctuary, and now makeshift medical treatment centre as a very injured Junior Researcher Byantara was wheeled in, dripping from Soviet bullets and blood. This did not do much justice to Doctor Vorenus's appetite, as he dropped his forkful of meatballs and linguini to gaze at what was - <em>snigger</em> - a man more holey than even himself. Strelnikov had not been kind on the trigger, and had been much less kinder to that \"mother-fuck Chechen collaborator\" Byantara. Poor guy looked as if he were covered in the bolognaise sauce that drenched Vorenus's plate. Eugh.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere in Block 2A, forty-eight sex toys relentlessly continued to buzz, rattling the beams and shaking paint off the ceilings. A jostle, a twitch, and <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-297\" target=\"_blank\">one clear plastic vibrator</a> popped loose of its bolts, rattled across the floor and came to rest in a corner with a sharp <em>click</em>. There was a hissing noise as the micronised nuclear reactor powered up, resonating the device at a shrill hypersonic whine. Indeed, Byantara had prepared for the worst by including an ace up his blood-stained, bullet-hole-ridden sleeve.</p>\n<p>It was when Vorenus had nearly finished his pasta that the ceiling of Mess Hall began to shake, dropping white frosty flakes into his plate. Nearby, Byantara was halfway through having bullets extracted from his groin by a doctor. Despite the pain, he managed to glance a look at Doctor Vorenus, current holder of SCP-050, as weighty chunks of ceiling plaster buried the pastor of pasta.</p>\n<p>Byantara winced as the statue appeared on his bandaged chest, seemingly mocking his agony. Meanwhile, \"Steely Dan\" dropped from the gaping hole in Mess Hall 2's ceiling, its switch conveniently flicking to \"Off\" upon the impact against Vorenus's buried, gasping form.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Agent Wolf was having a rotten day.<br/>\nEvery year the prank war started and every year he had to clean up the mess that resulted from it.</p>\n<p>He had to track down the SCPs used.</p>\n<p>He had to find the vengeful personnel.</p>\n<p>He had to find out how Clef had filled a room full of shaving cream without anyone noticing.</p>\n<p>It was a dismal day for the agent, until he had happened into the mess hall just in time to see a little statue appear on the chest of one Junior Researcher Byantara.<br/>\nWolf couldn't help but stare, stricken with an idea.</p>\n<p>He could actually play a prank to get 050, and he knew just what to do.<br/>\nThe agent couldn't help but smile as the plan formed in his head.</p>\n<p>Little more than an hour passed after this thought, and now Byantara was walking rather quickly towards the safety of his office.</p>\n<p>\"Okay, showtime.\"</p>\n<p>Byantara didn't hear the whisper, but he did become aware that something was now blocking his way. Something so horrific he couldn't even scream.<br/>\n682 just stood there, blocking escape from the deserted hallway. The silence between researcher and monster stretched forever, until Byantara made a move to leave. As soon as he did, he was quickly swallowed whole. The eaten man tumbled down the nightmare's stomach, splashing into a disgusting ooze.</p>\n<p>\"Aw man, did you really have to eat him? I thought we were just gonna scare him.\"</p>\n<p>Byantara found himself dumbfounded, he could hear Wolf's voice from the disgusting bowels.</p>\n<p>\"Hey Byantara, I see ya found my new partner, sorry about the whole gonna-die-soon thing.\"</p>\n<p>\"Come on, tell him to spit me out! Please!\"</p>\n<p>\"Well,\" a few seconds' pause, \"I guess I could\u2026 But ya really should use 'them'\".</p>\n<p>And on cue 682 split into a large number of butterflies, which revealed the researcher to be sitting in a pool of some store-bought slime. \"Thanks pally!\" Wolf smiled, showing an image on his laptop to the newly slimy man.<br/>\nAn image of a small monkey statue sitting next to the nameplate of Agent Wolf.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>With no security clearence, being a guard for the Foundation could be a very boring job. Typically, Fortis was stuck manning the security feeds. The most monotonous of assignments. On Senior Staff Shenanigans day, however, it had certain advantages. He had everything on hand, just needed the right mark in the right place. When he saw Agent Wolf, J.R. Byantara, and SCP-408 in Corridor 2-B he knew he had just enough time to pull it off. He took a second to locate the office SCP-050 had appeared in before springing to action..</p>\n<p>Fortis quickly changed into the red military uniform he had nearby, slathered his face with stage makeup, and donned the appropriate gloves and hat. He grabbed the can of paint stashed behind the door and headed out of the room. Finally, he made his way down the hall to pick up a container of Play-Doh, and rushed to SCP-786.</p>\n<p>Ten minutes later, Fortis entered the agent's office.</p>\n<p>\u201cAgent Wolf, am I right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes\u2026\u2026.who are you? And why are you red?\u201d</p>\n<p>Without warning, the junior guard emptied a full can of blue paint on the agent.</p>\n<p>\u201cI found him boys! Get him!\u201d</p>\n<p>Agent Wolf had a second to register surprise as a squad of solid red army personell filled the room and riddled his torso with clay bullets.</p>\n<p>Fortis couldn't help but smile to himself as he reentered Site 19's Surviellance Room. He changed back into his uniform and stached the red one. He had already washed off the paint, all that was left was to make sure no one else entered the area. He idly examined the monkey statue that was waiting for him on the console, slightly bemused at the thought of a junior guard entering the ranks of Senior Staff.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Linguistics/Supernatural Researcher Veldi had seemingly not participated in the contest, although he had been seen carting tomatoes all over the facility and setting them down at random. After emptying the cart, he retrieved SCP-005 from storage, and accessed an area from which he could work his magic.</p>\n<p>With an enormous grin plastered on his face, Veldi spoke into the intercom.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happens when 682 gets heartburn? \u2026.. Absolutely nothing, the Lizard doesn\u2019t get heartburn!\u201d</p>\n<p>In that moment, dozens and dozens of SCP-504 splattered into speakers, personnel and everything in general.</p>\n<p>\u201cI freaking love these tomatoes.\u201d Veldi checked the video feed to his office. Yup, there was the monkey, on his desk. Of course, there was the issue that he now had a PC instead of a MacBook\u2026</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>As soon as the prank wars started, SCP-738 was Junior Researcher Gille's first destination. It followed contracts steadily, nevermind the side consequences. Nothing he was going to do would harm him THAT much.</p>\n<p>The contract? Get the monkey of the last person to have it, and transport it to the middle of the Senior Break room.</p>\n<p>Second destination: The Senior Break room. From there, it would be rigged with 20 paintball guns, all set to fire when the sensor picks up movement in a circle around the Monkey. Then, when someone inevitably gets pelted, he walks in and grabs the Monkey.</p>\n<p>Third destination: His secret hiding spot, outfitted with a view of all the places he will need to be at.</p>\n<p>Fourth destination: SCP-682's storage area. Considering it's been let free, but it's still the safest place on the site, that should be a logical place to store it. Hidden in the third drawer of his desk, however, are 3 pistols, fully loaded no less, with 5 clips, and rations to last 2 days. It pays to be prepared for this day.</p>\n<p>Before leaving, Gille remembered to put a bucket of spiders on the door too his office. Someone will inevitably think to check there once he gets the monkey, so this should discourage them.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.\"</p>\n<p>\"Not at all. Between you and me, dealing with amateurs day in and day out is so tedious.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm sure. Now you know that one of our little annual celebrations is coming up soon, and it occured to me that one or more of my colleagues may come to you for help. I would appreciate it if you might extend me certain professional courtesies around that.\"</p>\n<p>\"Sir, are you suggesting that I breach confidentiality? I do have some scruples.\"</p>\n<p>\"Of course not! Wouldn't think of it. But perhaps you could take, let's say, the broadest possible interpretation of the agreed-upon terms.\"</p>\n<p>\"You want the monkey for yourself?\"</p>\n<p>\"Since you bring it up, what compensation would you want, in exchange for my permanent posession of said monkey?\"</p>\n<p>The humanoid figure behind the desk beckons and the smaller man before the desk leans forward. He whispers something in his ear.</p>\n<p>\"Interesting. Not at all what I'd expected. And I must say that, while I'm flattered that you offer, I'm very happy to work for the Foundation, and don't contemplate a change anytime soon. Let me make a proposal of my own. In exchange for the aforesaid professional courtesies leading to temporary possession\u2026\"</p>\n<p>It takes some time, but eventually the human and the entity wearing the face of a legendary law professor reach an agreement. A secretary is summoned from the accounting department, sworn to secrecy, duly threatened with death, and made to witness an agreement that bursts into flames the moment the formalities are complete.</p>\n<p>Sheldon Katz and the entity shake hands.</p>\n<p>Across the site, in a specially rigged broom closet, Junior Researcher Gille watches the Senior Break room on screen, then 682's pen, then his office, then back to the break room. Nothing. Wait. Something.</p>\n<p>Something rushes into the room, something about knee-high and very fast, something with a single bright blue eye in the middle of its bulbous yellow body. It's dribbling a smaller object in front of it like a soccer ball. As it pauses on the periphery of the circle of paintball guns, the \"ball\" comes to rest. It's a statuette of a monkey.</p>\n<p>Researcher Veldi runs into the room, panting and red-faced. The Eye-Pod skitters away from him. Veldi lunges, and a chase ensues around the edges of the room, with the Eye-Pod and the monkey always staying just out of Veldi's reach.</p>\n<p>After four circuits of the room, the Eye-Pod makes a sudden break to the right. Veldi leaps, trying to tackle it, and trips over his own feet. On the floor, he hears a series of clicks followed immediately by splatting sounds, and wonders for a moment if he somehow missed some tomatoes. He picks himself up, and observes that the walls of the break room have a new paint job in the style of Jackson Pollock.</p>\n<p>The Eye-Pod scurries out of the break room and heads down a corridor, rolling the monkey down the hall still. Gille jumps up from his seat and sprints down the hall. He figures if he goes down corridor 37, then makes a sharp right just before the firehose he can head them off\u2014yes! Here they are, and he's just a pace behind Veldi. He drops his head and starts running as fast as he can.</p>\n<p>\"You think that's funny? I hate running,\" says Veldi between gasps.</p>\n<p>The researchers sprint after the Eye-Pod, neither gaining any real advantage or getting any closer. They follow it now left, now right, now a long straightaway and into a dead end, a small chamber at the end of a long corridor. Gille jumps on the monkey and Veldi jumps on Gille. They grapple on the floor, neither noticing the Eye-Pod backing out of the room until they hear the door start to close. Gille looks up just in time to notice a third figure in the room: humanoid, but made of concrete and covered in spray paint.</p>\n<p>In the awkward silence that ensues, the disappearance of the monkey barely registers on them.</p>\n<p>Finally Veldi says: \"I've got to blink on three. One\u2026two\u2026\"</p>\n<p>Katz notes the monkey statue that now sits atop his empty inbox. He's already senior staff, but his secretary is out sick and nobody from the temp pool can seem to ever type up his briefs just the way he likes them. He looks through the stack of neatly-formatted documents before him and nods in satisfaction. Yes, the devil will have his due, but he does love a nice-looking brief. Worth it.</p>\n<p>He picks up the monkey and goes into the hallway outside his office, waiting for someone going in the right direction who looks sufficiently junior and sufficiently gullible. Soon enough, a cub researcher who he doesn't recognize passes by, and Sheldon intercepts him.</p>\n<p>\"Excuse me, young man, could I ask a favor? Someone left this in my office and they need it for a team-building exercise in the main cafeteria. Just take it up there and someone will show you what to do next.\"</p>\n<p>He feels slightly bad, watching the eager youth hurry down the hall with the monkey, but better him than Sheldon, and in any case this will teach him a number of valuable lessons.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Doctor Briar sighed, looking over the contents of his small office. It had been a long, hard road to get here. So many times, he'd thought he would die. So many times, he had lost what he thought of as \"everything\", only to build himself up so he would have something else to lose when the time came again. It had certainly not been easy, but he'd managed, somehow\u2026</p>\n<p>He always wished it could have been easier, though. If only there had been some way he could have made his journey to a respected member of senior staff without having to endure so much suffering. Of course, he had only been a low-level recruit in the Foundation when they stopped holding the Staff Prank Wars. He had heard of them, of course, and how the cleverest member of the Foundation's personnel stood to be raised to Senior Staff for winning. It was truly a shame that he had been so new when they held the last of them, an all but nameless lab assistant, not trusted with anything more important than proofreading documents\u2026but then, that was his advantage, wasn't it?</p>\n<p>Briar smiled, looking at the assembled items and documents sitting on his desk. At the top of the pile was a death certificate. Just another Foundation employee that had finally met his end, but to the elderly man at the desk, an opportunity. After all, permanent ownership didn't extend past death. Most importantly, however, was the small locked box on top of the pile. There were so many anomalous objects with temporal effects in Foundation custody that they hardly bothered to catalogue them all. No one would notice he had \"borrowed\" SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 among a batch of other research materials, and the letter he planned to mail would not be going anywhere that it would be looked for. Chuckling to himself, Doctor Briar took out a fountain pen, and began to write.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Years earlier, a much younger version of the same man breathed heavily, hiding in a cubical and shaking. In his hand he held a much-folded piece of heavy parchment, written upon in flowing calligraphy. Nervous, he muttered the words aloud as he re-read the page, \"Volunteer to assist in accounting. Short-staffed due to people calling in sick to avoid the contest. Agree to witness a contract. False name. Render null and void\u2026\"</p>\n<p>He shook his head in disbelief, dizzy with the implications. It couldn't be that easy, could it? Of course, he had barely dared believe what he held in his hands until the prank war began to unfold, exactly as the note claimed it would. Still, it seemed too good to be true. A deal with the Devil shouldn't be so simple to thwart, even if it wasn't <em>really</em> the Devil. Of course, the plan wasn't over yet. Just botching Katz's deal wouldn't much of a prank by itself, after all. Steeling himself, the younger Briar stepped out of the cubical, and announced that he was going on his lunch break. As he entered into the corridor, he put on a ring, and pulled out the small electronic device from his pocket.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>At the doors of the cafeteria, a young researcher was stopped by a polite cough. He turned, his face guileless and smiling. A dark-haired man snatched the bundle out of his hands before he had a moment to react.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, thank goodness I caught you in time! I am SO sorry! It seems that my colleague gave you the wrong article by mistake. <em>This</em> is the one they need in there.\"</p>\n<p>A small device was pressed into the researcher's hands. He babbled for a few moments about how glad he was to help, and how sorry he was that the other man had to chase him all the way here. Briar, in turn, made his excuses, politely stating that it was no trouble, but he really had to get back to work. He gave the hapless researcher some basic instructions on how to set up the device, and told him to just \"get it started for them\". As he hurried to return SCP-399 to containment, he could hear his modified MP3 player begin to loop Rick Astley's most famous composition with enough bass to shake the light fixtures. The altered lyrics, bragging of the genius of one Sheldon Katz, could just barely be made out from where he stood. Since he didn't have an office, Briar made a note to check his locker later on.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>A D-Class that had been fortunate enough to avoid all of the chaos of the day was desperately looking for a place to hide. He found an isolated cell, and quickly opened the door, failing to notice the number \"173\" emblazoned above the door.</p>\n<p>The moment the door was fully open, he stepped through the frame. He saw two men on the floor, and then he looked up.</p>\n<p>He recognized the sculpture a few seconds too late.</p>\n<p>Veldi and Gille charged him, threw him in the cell, and quickly closed the door. The sound of bones breaking followed shortly after.</p>\n<p>Veldi breathed a sigh of relief. \"Well, that was fun. Next time, let's check doors before going in them. Don't want Blinky to be let out.\"</p>\n<p>Gille was shivering from the experience. Veldi leaned down. \"Oh, by the way\u2026 I think ahead.\" He pointed out that the wall opposite 173's containment had been painted red. Gille was still in a stupor, so Veldi walked away and pressed a button on his phone. A tinny, electronic voice came from above the door: \"Leggo my Eggo-carrying Lego Winnebago full of\u2013\" The sound was cut short by a wall of tomato juice.</p>\n<p>Veldi checked the video feed on his phone again. Yep, the monkey was on his desk. He figured that he should set some more traps so that it wouldn't stay away for long. He hurried to his supplies.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Veldi returned to his office, hoping that some son-of-a-bitch hadn't gotten there before him. He set his supplies down, opened the door, and glanced at his hard-won prize\u2026</p>\n<p>And there was no monkey statue. He checked again. Whoever had run off with it had left a note. Hoping it didn't have some G\u2588d-awful cognitohazard, he read:</p>\n<p><em>Unless properly defended, your monkey statue is <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">my</span> monkey statue. See you later, noob.</em><br/>\n<em>~ Agent Gummy Dragon</em></p>\n<p>Impossible! You couldn't just <em>take</em> the statue. you had to <em>earn</em> it. Veldi searched his office in a panic. He opened his cabinets\u2026</p>\n<p>And a small puppy stared him in the eye.</p>\n<p>And that puppy's excited barking brought puppies out of the drawers, trashcan, and hallway. Veldi couldn't take it, and ran screaming from the adorable mob of canines pursuing him.</p>\n<p>Gummy laughed as he viewed the security feed from his office. Sending <a href=\"http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-662\">Mr. Deeds</a> to hide the statue behind a potted plant, fill Veldi's office with puppies, and plant the note he had written, all while Veldi was out, had been easier than expected. Gummy had barricaded his office door and stocked up on sandwiches and water bottles, so he should have been safe.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Dr. Len Blue frantically pushed a large storage cart out into an open field outside Site-19 after \"taking a week off.\" He was, if nothing else, determined to get that damned monkey.</p>\n<p>Over the past week, he had stolen the flying pig, as detailed under the Log of Anomalous Items, from Site-18 and used SCP-038 to make almost a hundred duplicates before returning the original. He had stolen SCP-000-J from Professor Snider while he was away and quickly returned it after ordering SCP-184. He had stolen multiple Scranton Reality Buoys from a manufacturing facility. He had bought large amounts of wood, cardboard, ropes, pillows, blankets, bread, water, hog feed, fireworks, slingshots, and iron pellets. And now, he was going to pull of the most legendary prank of all time.</p>\n<p>He stopped the cart right in front of a large structure covered in green tarp and yanked it down, revealing a very large play fort, three and a half meters wide, constructed of wood, pillows and cardboard, decorated with castle turrets and containing six rooms: a central room filled with computer equipment and containing a generator, a barracks for the pigs with multiple hammocks, an armory full of fireworks and slingshots with ammunition, a storehouse full of stolen rations, bread, water, and hog feed, a hangar for the launch of armed flying pigs, and a room containing four Scranton Reality Buoys suspended in the middle of the room with ropes, with wires attached to it.</p>\n<p>Dr. Blue, exhausted, unloaded bags of animate, plastic flying pigs from the overturned cart and dumped them into the hammocks after taking them in. Then, he hauled in SCP-184, still attached to its electromagnet, dropped it in the control room, and called Agent Gummy Dragon.</p>\n<p>He began the conversation. \"This is your last chance, Agent. Come out and surrender the monkey or I'll unleash my latest work of magic: the unstoppable, growing Expand-O-Fort. Site-19 will be torn asunder by my trained armies of cybernetic flying pigs, and I will have the monkey in the end.\"<br/>\n\"Do it, then. If it's so unstoppable, I'd like to see you actually unleash it,\" replied Gummy. And at that, he hung up, and spliced into the security feed of the grasslands outside Site-19.</p>\n<p>Dr. Blue turned off the electromagnet, and SCP-184 began expanding the interior walls of the fort. But the Scranton Reality Buoys nullified the physically impossible interior-only effect of SCP-184, and the entire fort expanded. Released from this effect, which had to expend energy bending spacetime, the fort could expand very quickly and immediately after SCP-184 entered it.</p>\n<p>Agent Gummy Dragon could only watch in horror as the fortress expanded a meter in two seconds and kept going even faster. But he knew he was in a bad spot here. If he called any kind of authority about this, everyone at Site-19 would be disciplined for the prank war. With no other options, he used his conference phone to call Dr. Bright, Dr. Veldi, Dr. Clef, and Agent Strelnikov, explained the situation frantically.</p>\n<p>Dr. Clef, mortified, responded, \"No.\" After a long pause, he said, \"He has 184.\"</p>\n<p>Everyone collectively gasped. \"I'm calling an MTF,\" said Dr. Clef. \"Bright and Veldi, get EMP grenades, take a jeep and get into that fortress as fast as you can. Strelnikov, get to a machine gun tower and set that thing on fire with tracers. Gummy, hold on to that monkey, and keep it away from Blue as long as possible.\" And at that, Dr. Clef hung up.</p>\n<p>The fortress was already forty meters wide, having taken on a pyramid shape, and new rooms were forming. Dr. Blue's army of computer-controlled pigs was mutating and growing. Dr. Blue keyed in a command, and hundreds of winged pigs spewed out of a large hangar in the side of the fortress. Agent Strelnikov reached the top of a guard tower with hundreds of incendiary tracers and loaded them into the heavy machine gun turret. Leaning out the window, he opened fire on the tip of the fortress, setting the top of it on fire.</p>\n<p>The Jeep shot out of the gates of Site-19. Dr. Blue, not worried, locked the hundreds of three-inch fully functional winged pigs onto their Jeep. Dr. Veldi pulled an EMP grenade out of his pocket and threw it into the swarm, disabling almost all of their robotic implants and causing them to fly off in all directions. Moments later, it crashed full force into a sliding door made of abnormally dense pillows.</p>\n<p>When Bright and Veldi recovered, they found themselves inside a hangar of computer-controlled toy pigs made entirely of fireworks. In the back of the room was a door, three slingshots made of pillows, and an iron computer manual.</p>\n<p>\"Come on!,\" yelled Dr. Bright, running for the door. \"We have to go deeper!\"</p>\n<p>The doctors suddenly found themselves in a room containing a single two-meter-wide Scranton Reality Buoy, composed entirely of cardboard. Dr. Veldi threw an EMP grenade into it. The grenade punched through the SRB and came right out the other side before detonating. The entire buoy then collapsed as though it was made of rigid paper.</p>\n<p>Then, suddenly, everything around the two doctors collapsed, destroying several more SRBs around them, resulting in a chain reaction that tore through the outside of the fort.</p>\n<p>Bright and Veldi survived, and the Expand-O-Fort was collapsed. It appeared that SCP-184 had been turned off. The pigs were mostly deactivated and fell from the sky, and helicopters from MTF Psi-7 \"Home Improvement\" cleaned up the rest.</p>\n<p>And Dr. Blue wasn't in the fort. The whole time, he had been waiting for the fort to get big enough for him to shut off SCP-184 and then use all of its power reserves to teleport the monkey into his hands. He was riding a seven-foot robotic toy flying pig away from the rubble, carrying Doctors Bright and Veldi with him on a 50-pound rope made of slingshots which SCP-050 had affixed to the pig as a prank, before transferring to Dr. Veldi, pranking him by setting off one of his EMP grenades, and then back to Dr. Blue. And then the deactivated pig crashed.</p>\n<p>Later, after a lot of amnestic spraying and Dr. Blue's reassignment, Dr. Bright discovered the monkey in his locker.</p>\n<hr/>\n</div></body></html>", "raw_source": "\n\t[[>]]\n\n[[module Rate]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\nDr. Bright sat in the middle of the Cafeteria, the old fashioned computer set before him. Atop said computer was a certain statue of a certain monkey, which many people had tried to obtain. Around him stood, sat, or otherwise existed quite a large number of the junior staff, with a few seniors, all eyes glued to the good doctor.\n\n\n\n\"And...save. There we go. The entirety of site 19, backed up, and emailed elsewhere, so if this goes as balls up as I expect it to, we can reboot.\" He sighed, and stood up. \"In that case, I officially declare the beginning of the Staff Prank war of 2011. Whoever holds 050 at the end of a 24 hour period will be promoted to the ranks of Senior Staff. I currently hold it, so y'all can start by pranking me... May god have mercy on all our souls.\"\n\n\n\n...And then the bomb under his chair detonated, covering the cafeteria with lime green paint, and incidentally blowing his legs off in the process. Several rooms away, research assistant Renfield took her fingers out of her ears and looked happily down at the monkey statue now gracing her new desk.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nDmitri studied his reflection for a moment, adjusted the angle of his hat, then exited his quarters. The heel irons in his boots clicked on the linoleum floors as he walked briskly through the halls of Site 19. Those going about their daily business knew to stay out of the way when Strelnikov was about; his movements had purpose, and that could only mean a disaster was looming.\n\n\n\nIndeed it was. Renfield's office was only two floors down from his own.\n\n\n\nBefore he even knew it, he was reading the nametag on her door. Or rather, he was reading her name amongst a list of other assistants who shared this office. As he kicked the door off its hinges, he decided it didn't really matter whose office it was. His boots left dents in the sheet metal as he stepped over the broken door and surveyed the group of cowering interns, hand resting casually on his holster.\n\n\n\n\"Which ones of you is Rend Field.\"\u00a0\u00a0No answer.\n\n\n\n\"I WILL SHOOT ONE OF YOU EVERY MINUTE UNTIL I AM TOLD WHICH ONES OF YOU IS REND FIELD.\" The group parted like the Red Sea, leaving a smug looking young girl standing alone in the center. Dmitri's teeth shone as he growled at her.\n\n\n\n**TWO HOURS LATER**\n\n\n\n\"SON OF THE BITCH, JACK. GOD DAMMIT.\"\n\n\n\n\"Dmitri, you can't just shoot whoever is holding the monkey and expect to get it. That isn't a prank.\" Bright's wheelchair bumped into the back of Dmitri's leg as he manhandled it around. \"And get out of the damn way.\"\n\n\n\nDmitri jabbed a finger at Bright. \"IT IS A PRANK. I HAVE DONE THIS PRANK SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE, IN BOTH WARS.\"\n\n\n\n\"It's not a prank, Dmitri.\"\n\n\n\n\"YES IT IS!\"\n\n\n\n\"Dmitri. It's over. You're out of the competition now, for good. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go deal with Renfield in the infirmary....smug little bitch. You could have at least killed her.\"\n\n\n\nStrelnikov sighed heavily and returned to the quiet of his quarters, trying to reconcile himself to the fact that 050 would never be his.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nAgent Lament whistled quietly to himself, glancing down at his watch, nodding amiably to the nurse as she walked into Renfield's room carrying an IV bag of saline.\u00a0\u00a0Lament smirked slightly and started walking down the hallway, heading toward his extremely messy office and waiting outside the door.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nRenfield moaned in her sleep, the drugs having her knocked out completely. The nurse hooked up the IV bag, checked the prone woman's vitals, and left the room.\u00a0\u00a0Within three minutes Renfield's skin started to develop large, round hives, then her neck and throat started to swell as a severe allergic reaction set in, followed by her eyes shooting open as the stimulants hit her bloodstream.\u00a0\u00a0She tried to scream but couldn't, her throat beginning to close as she desperately hit the call button again and again and again...\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\nLament opened his door, looking into his office and smiling slightly at the statue. Now... How the hell could he get rid of it before someone noticed that he had it?\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\nFew people had a true appreciation for just how ingrained computers were with every single aspect of modern society, and the Foundation was no exception. Despite all the hard copies, every report, every researcher's note, every field log and every file photo was logged into a computer database somewhere. Every personnel transfer, every requisition form, every security feed, all set up in little 0's and 1's on a hard drive somewhere. When the transfer of Site 19's backup set off some alarms, he knew it was time. Kap - a name adopted because he was sick of people mispronouncing his full name - was sitting and typing away deep in the bowels of the Site. The coders and hardware gurus had a whole, unique set of regulations and security clearances, and the amount of information you were exposed to above your classification level was directly proportional to your time on the job. The guys that ran the networks and made sure the workstations functioned knew more than most of the researchers, though maybe not as much as that one janitor.\n\n\n\nOnce he realized that a mixed batch of saline and known allergens could only be used for the ever-escalating prank contests, a few key strokes were all it took to set retaliation in motion. A series of embedded programs ticked off other protocols which activated further batch processes. The sheer array of false IPs and bogus addresses would take the average user months to back-trace, and any of the other computer staff were already well-bribed with beer, pizza, and the promise of a neat and orderly work area. Lament opened the door to his office, seeing a single, solitary box laying there, carefully gift-wrapped and tied with a neat bow. It wasn't even close to his birthday, but there was no way any sort of bomb or other device could have made it that deep into a secure Foundation site, so he took it inside and opened it up.\n\n\n\nKap was as surprised as anyone when the little monkey appeared on top of his computer tower, and sighed slightly at the poor devil who was going to have to treat Lament and clean up the hundreds of tiny insects from his office. After all, the present was bees.\n\n\n\n----\n\n> INCIDENT 2011-\u2588\u2588\n\n> \n\n> T-330 minutes\n\n> Researcher Eisenberg seen carrying a set of mechanic tattooing equipment, origin unknown\n\n> \n\n> T-310 minutes\n\n> Researcher Eisenberg seen entering the enclosure of SCP-1006, carrying a bucket, a stack of papers, and his personal copies of Assorted Writings of V.I.

R. gave a quick knock and pushed the door open without waiting for a reply.\u00a0\u00a0Researcher Eisenberg visibly balked at the sudden intrusion, his eyes darting to the statue on his desk before reaching for the top drawer. \n\n\n\n\"Whoa whoa whoa!\u00a0\u00a0Calm down, I'm not going to do anything!\"\u00a0\u00a0Los E. R. held his palms out.\u00a0\u00a0\"See?\u00a0\u00a0Sorry, didn't think you'd be so jumpy.\"\n\n\n\nEisenberg stopped, eyeing the doctor warily, but kept his hand resting on the top drawer.\u00a0\u00a0\"What do you want?\"\n\n\n\n\"Word around the site is that you got 1006 to net Kap.\u00a0\u00a0Just wanted to say, that's brilliant!\u00a0\u00a0No one ever expects nets!\"\u00a0\u00a0Los E. R. chuckled to himself.\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, don't worry about me.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not going to pull some horrendous prank.\u00a0\u00a0I'd probably end up in the hospital, I've never been really good at elaborate pranks.\"\n\n\n\nEisenberg seemed to relax slightly at Los E. R.'s reassurance, but wasn't totally swayed.\u00a0\u00a0\"No, it wasn't nets, exactly...I had them tattoo Lenin on him.\"\n\n\n\nLos E. R. burst out laughing, leaning on the desk for support.\u00a0\u00a0\"You had them //tattoo// a portrait of //Lenin?!//\u00a0\u00a0That's genius!\u00a0\u00a0How does someone come up with something like that?!\u00a0\u00a0Oh man, I'd never pull something like that off, I'm no good with those elaborate pranks.\u00a0\u00a0Did you actually talk to those little commies yourself?\"\n\n\n\nEisenberg smiled and chuckled nervously.\u00a0\u00a0\"Yeah, it wasn't too hard to get them to agree.\u00a0\u00a0I mean, it //was// Lenin after all.\u00a0\u00a0Talking to a bunch of spiders though...that was kinda creepy.\u00a0\u00a0They were all over the place.\"\n\n\n\n\"I can tell.\u00a0\u00a0You've got a cobweb on your coat, here let me...\"\u00a0\u00a0Los E. R. reached forward and scratched at Eisenbergs lapel.\u00a0\u00a0On instinct, he glanced down to catch a glimpse of the bit of silk wafting from his collar, only to get a flick on the nose. \n\n\n\n\"Gotcha.\"\n\n\n\nStunned, he watched as Los E. R. laughed one more time before he scooped SCP-050 from his desk and exited the room.\u00a0\u00a0As he disappeared around the door frame, Eisenberg heard him chuckle.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Never was any good with those elaborate pranks.\"\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\"Hey, Los.\"\n\n\n\nLos E. R. felt a chill run down his spine at the voice. \"Oh no,\" he whimpered. \"Not HIM. . .\"\n\n\n\nHe turned around, clutching the monkey statue to his chest, as a breathtakingly ugly middle-aged man walked down the hall towards him. \"Relax,\" Clef said. \"I don't want that statue. I'm already senior staff, and I have no interest in Bright's games. You're safe from me.\"\n\n\n\nLos E. R. sighed in relief. \"Oh, thank god,\" he said. \"I really did not want to be subject to a prank by you.\"\n\n\n\n\"Hey, don't worry about it. I'm beyond that sort of bullshit anyway. I always thought that stuff was kinda stupid. In fact, as a sign of my goodwill, I'll escort you back to your office.\"\n\n\n\nLos E. R. quickly followed Clef down the hallway. It was amazing, he thought, what the presence of that man could do. A researcher leaped out from around the corner holding a giant creme pie, which he rapidly put down and walked away from. A man wearing a hockey mask and holding a machete took off his costume and had a sheepish talk with the Senior Researcher. It was wonderful. \n\n\n\n\"Well, here we are,\" Clef said. \n\n\n\nLos E. R. looked up at the door and frowned. \"This isn't my office,\" he said. \n\n\n\n\"What? Oh, oops.\u00a0\u00a0Sorry. 571, not 517. Let's go.\"\n\n\n\nClef led the junior staff member to the other side of the floor, and to his office. \"Well, here we are. . . again,\" he said, a few minutes later.\n\n\n\n\"Thanks a lot, Dr. Clef,\" Los E. R. said. \"I really appreciate it.\"\n\n\n\n\"No problem. Oh, Los? Remember when I said I had no interest in Bright's games?\" Clef grinned, a huge, evil, sinister grin. \"I lied.\"\n\n\n\nThat was when the door of Los' office exploded outward, and five thousand gallons of compressed shaving cream flooded the hallway.\n\n\n\nClef watched Los being carried away in the avalanche of white foam, and wiped a little spot off his jacket. \"Go get em', Adams,\" he murmured.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nEd from Accounting (everyone thought of him as \"Ed from Accounting\" -- including himself after 14 years at the job) hated the prank wars.\u00a0\u00a0A waste of staff time, the building maintenance budget, and the cost of injuries, if you asked him...which no one did.\u00a0\u00a0The usual threats -- paperwork, budget cuts, audits -- never seemed to work.\u00a0\u00a0More creative means were called for.\n\n\n\nEd called Junior Researcher Johnson.\u00a0\u00a0\"Is it ready? ... really? Good! Bring it around to my office.\"\n\n\n\nFifteen minutes later, Johnson was in Ed's dingy, cluttered office, handing him a small brown bag.\u00a0\u00a0Ed looked in the bag and smiled.\u00a0\u00a0\"How long will it stay that way?\"\n\n\n\n\"Weeks\" Johnson replied.\u00a0\u00a0\"at least, if no one touches it.\"\n\n\n\nEd put the bag in his briefcase, along with a small stack of papers.\u00a0\u00a012:20? Good.\u00a0\u00a0Adams would be off to lunch.\u00a0\u00a0He headed up to her office.\n\n\n\nEd knocked on the door, then let himself in.\u00a0\u00a0Good, no one there.\u00a0\u00a0It was easy to swap the item on Adams' desk for the one in the bag.\u00a0\u00a0He slipped the Form 1661-G under the inner door for Dr. Clef.\u00a0\u00a0That would excuse his visit; the auditors really did need it next week.\n\n\n\nBack downstairs in his office, Ed opened a file cabinet and dropped SCP-050, still in its bag, next to the 2004 Operating Budget reports. It looked like someone's long-forgotten lunch.\u00a0\u00a0He didn't care the least bit about \"winning\" it -- he just wanted it out of circulation. \n\n\n\nNo one would guess that he had the wit to obtain it.\n\nNo one would guess that he had pulled this particular prank, since he wasn't supposed to have any access to SCPs.\n\nNo one ever came down to Accounting if they could help it.\n\nSCP-050 would be there for a long time.\n\n\n\nWhen they found the fake, they would blame Johnson, who had shown some real success in training SCP-157.\n\n\n\n-------\n\n\n\nResearch Assistant Reject was having a nice, calm day, sipping his coffee and skimming through his newest batch of paperwork while strolling down the hallway to his office. He was called Reject for a very good reason: although he had been a member of the Foundation for ten years, he had been the same rank for over seven of them. He even called himself Reject. His bachelorhood had hopelessly dragged on much longer than he had ever hoped. He was used to being a reject. That was, until he spotted a man in a suit walking into Dr. Clef's office.\n\n\n\nReject was never known as an especially observant person, but today was different. He had heard about some pranks going on, but he didn't really care about any of that. He was determined to work his way up the ladder without shaving cream or explosives, just with hard work and dedication. Until he saw a very happy man running out of Dr. Clef's office, his arms crossed upon his chest. Reject could see a brown paper bag bobbing slightly above and below the man's arms. His interest piqued, Reject decided to follow him.\n\n\n\nThe man never turned around as he walked. Reject didn't have any trouble following him. Ten minutes later, Reject realized just how far they had walked. He turned his head. \"Accounting \u2014>\" was written on a sign, pointing in the direction that he was going. After another couple of minutes, the man turned sharply into an office. Reject peeked into the room to see another man converse shortly with the man he had followed and take the bag. Reject ducked behind a corner as both men exited the office.\n\n\n\nReject attempted to follow the man with the bag, but lost him in the maze of cubicles and offices in this unknown sector. Reject turned to leave, but decided not to let this go. This chance was his. He called up an old friend from Sector 28 with a favor to ask. His friend agreed, and in an hour, Reject knew that he would have the chance to become a Senior Staff member. He went to his office and placed an empty coffee mug alongside a mostly unread folder of paperwork.\n\n\n\nOne hour later, Reject met his friend in the cafeteria. Reject's friend handed him a bag with two words written on it. \"DON'T LOSE.\" Reject smiled, and walked briskly down towards the accounting offices. Once there, he took the item out of the bag. Staring at a sentient calculator was a new experience for him. After befriending SCP-168, he asked his new buddy a favor. The calculator agreed in return for the ability to see the rest of the prank war. Reject dropped SCP-168 in the office he had seen before as soon as the man inhabiting it left. Reject admired his handiwork. He took a seat on a nearby chair. When the man returned, he gave Reject a questioning glance, but dismissed it. After five minutes in his office, a scream was heard. When the man exited his office, his face was pale white. In his hand was SCP-168.\n\n\n\nThe man looked at the calculator and said \"Okay, okay. I'll go get it. I didn't realize the world would end if I didn't! I feel so awful\u2026\" Reject chuckled to himself and began to shadow the man as he hurried down the hallways. When they arrived at a file cabinet, the man stopped. He ran his finger along the cabinet until he reached \"2004 Operating Budget Reports Jan-Mar.\" He started typing on the calculator. After a short period, the calculator responded. The man jumped back, aghast. He yelped \"No! I brought you to the stupid monkey! That can't be!\" Reject quickly decided he'd had enough of complaining from this unknown man and dealt a swift uppercut to the jaw followed by an elbow to the nose. As he fell, Reject grabbed SCP-168 and the brown paper bag. Overjoyed, he began to walk back to his office. He looked once more at the unconscious accountant on the ground. And then he laughed, and left this bloody, deceptive business behind him as he strolled back towards his office with a renewed sense of confidence.\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\n\n\n\"Nevah let practicality stand in de way of //art//, my cousin.\" The humongously fat Hawaiian nodded ponderously at the uniformed corpse held aloft in his hand, then slowly shook it so that it's head nodded along. Chuckling to himself, he slipped the matchbook the poor guard had died failing to protect into an outer pocket of his enormous satchel next to a tarnished canteen, and waddled out of the ruined containment unit and down the hallway toward the personnel wing.\n\n\n\nFlanked by a pair of traitor guards, their sleeves rolled up to reveal liberty cuffs emblazoned with blaring abstract designs, the huge man reflected on the work and planning that had gone into this effort. It //was// impractical, sure. Infiltrating the Foundation's security forces alone had taken months. Fortunately, the prank war was a regular yearly event, so he'd had plenty of time to prepare. \n\n\n\n\"Ah, here it tis.\"\n\n\n\nHe stopped in front of a particular office, grinning as he began pulling the necessary materials from his satchel. A small funnel, a length of tubing, the matchbox and canteen, and hundreds of small paper packets, which his helpers began opening one by one.\n\n\n\nIt didn't take long to tape the tubing to the mouth of the canteen, and slide the other end under the door. It took only a little longer to funnel the contents of the packets into the gap, and considerably less to open the matchbook and slide it in as well before sealing the gap completely with more tape. Once their work was done, the big man rose and nodded to his companions, then paused to doodle a small cartoon on the door before heading back down the hallway they'd come in by and leave the facility.\n\n\n\nLater that day, as loyal security men tried desperately to work out what had happened to SCP's 649 and 109, Reject arrived at his office to find a scribbled caricature on his door of a fat man in a bowler hat giving him the finger, with the text \"PRANKED BY BRUDDAH GROVE! Are We Cool Yet?\". \n\n\n\nReject had just enough time to curse before the door burst and he was swamped by a massive wave of lime jello.\n\n\n\n------\n\nDr. Los E. R. dug a finger in his ear, trying to dig out the last vestiges of shaving cream.\u00a0\u00a0He winced as the dried bits twisted painfully before crumbling lose.\u00a0\u00a0Site 19 was a maze on the best of days, and on Senior Staff Shenanigans day it was a minefield.\u00a0\u00a0He rerouted around the third floor; he had heard that someone had gotten their hands on a metric ton of hissing cockroaches and thermite.\u00a0\u00a0He skirted the south side of the fourth floor, trying to find his way back to the restrooms to wash up.\u00a0\u00a0If memory served, it was at the end of the hall on his right, next door to where they put Research Assistant Reject after he somehow managed to shrink his office to a third of its original size.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nHe was scrapping dried flakes of cream from his lower back when he noticed he what he was walking in.\u00a0\u00a0Quizzically, he raised a foot to get a better look.\u00a0\u00a0Smells a little like lime, kind of minty.\u00a0\u00a0Looks like some kind of green...slime?\u00a0\u00a0He glanced down the hallway and saw Reject, lying in a puddle of the stuff.\u00a0\u00a0He was either out cold, or dea-\n\n\n\nLos E. R.'s heart skipped a beat as he put two and two together.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n[[size 1.5em]]\"DEAD BODIES!!!\"[[/size]]\n\n\n\nScreaming incoherently, Dr. Los E. R. hurtled back the way he came, sticky green jello foot prints marking his progress to the nearest [[[SCP-447]]] alarm.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nBruddah Grove paused as the klaxon sounded.\u00a0\u00a0Blast doors slid into place over the exit.\u00a0\u00a0How poetic, so close to freedom with artifacts of power.\u00a0\u00a0With the dead security guard he had been dragging along, he waved at his companion.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Dis noise, have they figured out what we are doing?\" \n\n\n\nThe traitorous guard shook his head, the blood draining from his face.\u00a0\u00a0\"That's the 447 alert.\u00a0\u00a0They've locked the exits.\u00a0\u00a0They're going to detonate the on-site warhead.\"\n\n\n\nThere was a full moment of silence.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nCarefully picking each word, Bruddah Grove looked at the tiny man.\n\n\n\n\"How doh we get out den?\"\n\n\n\nThe two guards looked at each other nervously.\u00a0\u00a0\"We don't.\u00a0\u00a0We could try to get to the O5 bunker, but we can't make it from here.\u00a0\u00a0It's fifty levels down-\"\n\n\n\n\"Wait!\"\u00a0\u00a0The other guard perked up.\u00a0\u00a0\"The Site septic tank!\u00a0\u00a0I know that they've started reenforcing them ever since Bright accidentally flushed 523.\u00a0\u00a0It might be able to withstand the blast!\"\n\n\n\n\"The Sewage Access Hatch isn't far from here, we can make it if we hurry!\"\n\n\n\nTaking the slim glimmer of hope for what ever it was worth, the trio hurried desperately down the hall.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nO5-8 sighed.\u00a0\u00a0This was not the first time the 447 alert had been sounded on Senior Staff Shenanigans Day.\u00a0\u00a0Before flipping the switch and killing everyone on-site, he took a moment to make sure it was a dead body.\u00a0\u00a0If it wasn't, no harm done.\u00a0\u00a0If it was, well...the nuke wouldn't do any good, anyways.\n\n\n\nA quick check later confirmed that Research Assistant Reject was not, in fact, dead.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps more importantly, it turned out that it wasn't even 447 slime at all.\u00a0\u00a0With an irritated grumble, he switched of the klaxon.\u00a0\u00a0This prank war was stupid.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nBruddah Grove sat in the filth of the entire Site, watching his two companions float face down in the lanterns pale light.\u00a0\u00a0He might be here for a while, and they were using up too much air.\u00a0\u00a0He reflected on how their lungs filled with filth and life drained from their bodies, a testament to how life starts pure and ignorance weighs innocence down with shit.\u00a0\u00a0A haiku rose unbidden from his lips.\n\n\n\n\"Here I stew in filth,\n\nWaiting for the Bombs Big Boom.\n\nNow, Are We Cool Yet?\"\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nDr. Los E. R. felt rather silly.\u00a0\u00a0Of course it was another prank.\u00a0\u00a0He should have known.\u00a0\u00a0It probably wasn't even meant for him.\n\n\n\nHaving long since given up hope of finding a bathroom to clean up in, he had started to work his way back to his office.\u00a0\u00a0Pushing the door open, a bucket of water immediately fell from atop the door.\u00a0\u00a0Irritated yet strangely grateful to get some kind of wash, he lifted the rim of the bucket to find the monkey sitting on his desk.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nJunior Researcher Byantara had prepared a whole week in advance for this day. With Senior Staff position at stake, there was no reason not to be prepared. Crazy prepared, in his case.\n\n\n\nSix days, thirteen hours, forty-five minutes and nine seconds ago, Byantara was profusely apologising to a very unamused Doctor Crow, surrounded by the products of twenty-three very startled Malayan Stink Badgers which had now escaped their cages and were clawing the wallpaper off Doctor Crow's office. Long story short, it was yet another round of maintenance duty for him.\n\n\n\nFour days, seven hours, two minutes and fifty-five seconds ago, Byantara began painting the offices on the third floor of Block 2A, by himself, using two paint rollers, a crate of white paint, a box of plaster, a crate of tomatoes, and several dozen rolled-up meters of ultra-thin semi-permeable tubing.\n\n\n\nTwo days, twelve hours, thirty-seven minutes and thirty-two seconds ago, a parcel arrived for Site-19, sealed with black tape and hastily recovered from designated post box PO-2354 by a certain shifty-looking Junior Researcher sent to collect the daily personal mail.\n\n\n\nOne day, two hours, and exactly forty-nine seconds ago, Byantara finished his lab work, packed up, cleaned Chamber 2A-2-1 and secured several large marital aids to the floor before locking up. He proceeded similarly for Chamber 2A-2-3, -2-5, -2-7 and -2-9, and left the building with a little smile. Now, all that was left was to hope someone in Block 2A actually managed to get hold of 050.\n\n\n\nOne hour, three minutes and twenty-one seconds ago, he idly browsed through the frantically compiled digital record of SCP-050 possession. Soon it would arrive. From Bright, to Clef, to Reject...\n\n\n\nByantara refreshed the page, spat out his acrid coffee, and dashed out of the lab. In his right hand was a remote, with a single green button, and he mashed it in double time to his steps towards the central communications office. Tucked in safely mere inches above the ceiling of Doctor Los's freshly painted office, forty-eight plastic phalluses began to hum.\n\n\n\nAs expected, not only was the comms office a very long distance away, it was also utter chaos. Someone had sounded some sort of alarm beforehand, and whoever was meant to be guarding the place were long gone, leaving dog-eared papers in their wake. Chuckling to himself, he called up the speaker of Office 2A-3-5.\n\n\n\nFive seconds. Four seconds. Byantara cleared his throat. Three. The collective vibrations caused by the forty-eight sex toys would be building up to the maximum by now, shaking the ceiling - and walls - of every office on the floor below it, rupturing the many little sachets of tomato juice seeded in the plaster beneath the apple-scented white paint. Two. \n\n\n\nJunior Researcher Byantara took a deep breath. One.\n\n\n\nIn his office, Doctor Los E. R. cowered beneath his desk as the walls began to bleed and the ceiling screamed his name. He was too busy wetting his pants to notice SCP-050 disappear from his office, later to be found in the locker of Junior Researcher Byantara.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n\"Bloody Los... Surprised that even worked as a prank... \" Researcher Eisenberg sat at his desk, absentmindedly stroking Nastasia, his linen cat. \"I'll teach him to cut the latin...wait, that's an idea.\".\n\nResearcher Eisenberg rushed out of his office, and returned rather sweaty, holding a heavy Latin dictionary. Work has just begun.\n\n\n\nAbout an hour later - languages weren't exactly his strong side - Researcher Eisenberg arrived into the containment cell of SCP-758, with a sheet of paper heavily worn out with eraser marks. It might have been his imagination, but it seemed that upon seeing it, Vasili let out a sigh before introducing an ample amount of corrections. A glance at the current tally showed him however, that the statue has changed owners several times since he started his preparations, currently residing at the desk of some no-name Junior Researcher... whose name was actually rather lengthy. \"Byan-ta-ra... bloody hell, and I thought my surname was unwieldy.\" Researcher Eisenberg sighed and took out a pencil. \n\n\n\n\"Bloody hell, hope this ink is black enough...\" His sweaty hands grabbed the worn leather of SCP-141, an act that would make many a bibliophile cringe, and he began to laboriously scribble onto the first free page, trying to imitate the original writing as well as possible. \"..e-ra-tio ... that should be it\".\u00a0\u00a0Shaking with expectation, he ran to the nearest internet-enabled terminal.\n\nA quick search, and even quicker email from a disposable address later, Vladim. A. Eisenberg, in his mind already a Senior Researcher, walked back to his office.\n\n------\n\nSitting at his desk, Junior Researcher Byantara\u00a0\u00a0was enjoying the fruit of a day's work - SCP-050 stood on his surprisingly clean table, and if it was his lucky day, he might just about be among the few Foundation employees to ever skip a rank. \"Wonder if Los has caught them all... he's lucky\u00a0\u00a0there isn't 151.. I wonder if the big one counts as Sn-\" \n\nHis thoughts were interrupted by a kick into the door, and in the next moment, he had to take cover behind his desk from a hail of bullets, accompanied by an even stronger hail of high-fidelity Russian swearing. A desk that the monkey statue has conveniently disappeared from.\n\n------\n\nEarlier...\n\n> To: dastrelnikov@scp.org\n\n> From: lynxes_unlimited@mailinator.com\n\n> Subject: Take a look at who you work with, Dimitri\n\n> Junior Researcher Byantara is an interesting man, isn't it?\n\n> www.cnn.com/2011/11/15/Europe/scientist-accused-of-aiding-chechen-terrorists/index.html\n\n------\n\nResearcher Eisenberg prepared himself a cup of tea, and against all rules of hygiene, kissed the small statue, which responded by giving him a mild electric shock.\n\n\u00a0------\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n\" Hey buddy,\u00a0\u00a0I see no one has bothered to come see you today.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sorry for that, alot of shi..stuff has been going on ,but it's fun stuff.\u00a0\u00a0You know what a prank is?\u00a0\u00a0Good,\u00a0\u00a0you wanna help me with one?\u00a0\u00a0Oh don't worry no one will get hurt, and here have some MnMs. Tasty aren't they?\u00a0\u00a0You wanna help me now.\u00a0\u00a0That's great!\u00a0\u00a0Here's the plan.\"\n\n\n\nAs he watched the gelatinous form move from the room,\u00a0\u00a0a smile formed on Junior Researcher Tad's face.\u00a0\u00a0It was his time to shine for once.\u00a0\u00a0It was luck that he walked by Eisenberg's office just in time to see the statue appear on his desk.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nEisenberg sipped at his tea, giving glances to his prize every few seconds.\u00a0\u00a0He also kept an eye on the door.\u00a0\u00a0Making sure that no fool would try to win the statue.\u00a0\u00a0If only he thought to check the airvent.\u00a0\u00a0As the orange form lowered down, it's pseudopods at the ready. Eisenberg looked up;\u00a0\u00a0Even with the strong smell of herbs in his nose he picked up another scent.\u00a0\u00a0The smell of the fur was indistinguishable to him, yet how could it be?\u00a0\u00a0As he turned around a high pitched squealed erupted followed by a shout.\n\n**\"TICKLE WRESTLING!\"**\n\nThe statue appeared alongside Tad at his cubicle.\u00a0\u00a0He was going to enjoy the next few minutes, than probably regret getting involved in the first place.\u00a0\u00a0At least his desk looked organized for once.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nAs Tad passed through an open door, the bucket teetering there fell forward, onto his head. Have you even had your entire head covered, not just in horse shit, but horse shit filled with horrible ideas? It's not a pleasant feeling. Luckily, Tad passed out before something horrible crawled out of SCP-100-J.\n\n\n\nFather Jakal looked up from his prayers, at the monkey statue which had appeared on his podium. A slight smile graced his lips. \"Fuck, i didn't think that'd really work!\"\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nDr Pullo Vorenus, Level 2 Researcher and Safe item specialist, paused as he walked past Site-19's nondenominational multipurpose chapel-crematorium-ossuary. As far as he could tell, priests didn't usually swear like that in church. At least, the priests back home hadn't. Except for Father Kowalski. When he was drunk. He poked his head in, and saw Father Jakal stroking a small statue. Then he ran to his small, shared office. \n\n\n\nAfter an hour or so of research, Doctor Vorenus was ready. He stopped by the Safe item storage lockers, and checked out a certain item, under the guise of \"additional research on the effects of the object when combined with religious exultation and //tagiatelle//\". A quick trip to the Site cafeteria, and the acquisition of some high-powered arc lights, and he was done. After telling the priest that his presence had been requested in the depths of the accounting department, he was ready to prepare. \n\n\n\nFather Jakal returned, still clutching the statue with a death grip. He seemed determined that nobody separate him from 050 from even a moment. As he entered the multipurpose nondenominational chapel-crematorium-ossuary, the door slammed shut and a heavenly light shone down on him from On High. He fell to his knees as a voice from Above called out into his mind, \"Father Jakal, thou hast been chosen.\" As he knelt gasping, trying to for a coherent sentence, the Voice continued, \"Thou shalt be My prophet on this earth. I shall show thee My true form, that thou may tell of Me to all thy fellows.\" The lights brightened, and Father Jakal shaded his eyes, cowering even further before the Lord his God. All the lights in the chapel shut off suddenly, and a form appeared above him in the rafters, lit from within. As he looked up, in full religious exultation, something fell onto his shoulder and slid to the floor with a //plop//. \"Thou hast been touched by My Noodly Appendage. Rejoice. And eat thy grains.\"\n\n\n\nDoctor Vorenus smiled, as he heard Father Jackal stomp out and call for a janitor. After putting the megaphone back in its locker, he returned to his shared office, and found his half meticulously cleaned. The precise line between the dirty and clean carpet might be hard to explain to his office-mate, but he was sure he could figure it out. After all, he was Doctor Pullo Vorenus, Level 2 Researcher, Safe Item Specialist, current owner of a small statue, and devout Pastafarian.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nIt was an interesting day for Mess Hall 2. In the chaos of Prank Day, it had somehow transformed itself into both an eatery, sanctuary, and now makeshift medical treatment centre as a very injured Junior Researcher Byantara was wheeled in, dripping from Soviet bullets and blood. This did not do much justice to Doctor Vorenus's appetite, as he dropped his forkful of meatballs and linguini to gaze at what was - //snigger// - a man more holey than even himself. Strelnikov had not been kind on the trigger, and had been much less kinder to that \"mother-fuck Chechen collaborator\" Byantara. Poor guy looked as if he were covered in the bolognaise sauce that drenched Vorenus's plate. Eugh.\n\n\n\nElsewhere in Block 2A, forty-eight sex toys relentlessly continued to buzz, rattling the beams and shaking paint off the ceilings. A jostle, a twitch, and [*http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-297 one clear plastic vibrator] popped loose of its bolts, rattled across the floor and came to rest in a corner with a sharp //click//. There was a hissing noise as the micronised nuclear reactor powered up, resonating the device at a shrill hypersonic whine. Indeed, Byantara had prepared for the worst by including an ace up his blood-stained, bullet-hole-ridden sleeve.\n\n\n\nIt was when Vorenus had nearly finished his pasta that the ceiling of Mess Hall began to shake, dropping white frosty flakes into his plate. Nearby, Byantara was halfway through having bullets extracted from his groin by a doctor. Despite the pain, he managed to glance a look at Doctor Vorenus, current holder of SCP-050, as weighty chunks of ceiling plaster buried the pastor of pasta.\n\n\n\nByantara winced as the statue appeared on his bandaged chest, seemingly mocking his agony. Meanwhile, \"Steely Dan\" dropped from the gaping hole in Mess Hall 2's ceiling, its switch conveniently flicking to \"Off\" upon the impact against Vorenus's buried, gasping form.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nAgent Wolf was having a rotten day.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nEvery year the prank war started and every year he had to clean up the mess that resulted from it.\n\n\n\nHe had to track down the SCPs used.\n\n\n\nHe had to find the vengeful personnel.\n\n\n\nHe had to find out how Clef had filled a room full of shaving cream without anyone noticing.\n\n\n\nIt was a dismal day for the agent, until he had happened into the mess hall just in time to see a little statue appear on the chest of one Junior Researcher Byantara.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWolf couldn't help but stare, stricken with an idea.\n\n\n\nHe could actually play a prank to get 050, and he knew just what to do.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe agent couldn't help but smile as the plan formed in his head.\n\n\n\nLittle more than an hour passed after this thought, and now Byantara was walking rather quickly towards the safety of his office.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\"Okay, showtime.\"\n\n\n\nByantara didn't hear the whisper, but he did become aware that something was now blocking his way.\u00a0\u00a0Something so horrific he couldn't even scream.\n\n682 just stood there, blocking escape from the deserted hallway.\u00a0\u00a0The silence between researcher and monster stretched forever, until Byantara made a move to leave.\u00a0\u00a0As soon as he did, he was quickly swallowed whole.\u00a0\u00a0The eaten man tumbled down the nightmare's stomach, splashing into a disgusting ooze.\n\n\n\n\"Aw man, did you really have to eat him? I thought we were just gonna scare him.\"\n\n\n\nByantara found himself dumbfounded, he could hear Wolf's voice from the disgusting bowels.\n\n\n\n\"Hey Byantara, I see ya found my new partner, sorry about the whole gonna-die-soon thing.\"\n\n\n\n\"Come on, tell him to spit me out!\u00a0\u00a0Please!\"\n\n\n\n\"Well,\" a few seconds' pause, \"I guess I could...\u00a0\u00a0But ya really should use 'them'\".\n\n\n\nAnd on cue 682 split into a large number of butterflies, which revealed the researcher to be sitting in a pool of some store-bought slime.\u00a0\u00a0\"Thanks pally!\" Wolf smiled, showing an image on his laptop to the newly slimy man.\n\nAn image of a small monkey statue sitting next to the nameplate of Agent Wolf.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nWith no security clearence, being a guard for the Foundation could be a very boring job.\u00a0\u00a0Typically, Fortis was stuck manning the security feeds.\u00a0\u00a0The most monotonous of assignments.\u00a0\u00a0On Senior Staff Shenanigans day, however, it had certain advantages.\u00a0\u00a0He had everything on hand, just needed the right mark in the right place.\u00a0\u00a0When he saw Agent Wolf, J.R. Byantara, and SCP-408 in Corridor 2-B he knew he had just enough time to pull it off.\u00a0\u00a0He took a second to locate the office SCP-050 had appeared in before springing to action..\n\n\n\nFortis quickly changed into the red military uniform he had nearby, slathered his face with stage makeup, and donned the appropriate gloves and hat.\u00a0\u00a0He grabbed the can of paint stashed behind the door and headed out of the room.\u00a0\u00a0Finally, he made his way down the hall to pick up a container of Play-Doh, and rushed to SCP-786.\n\n\n\nTen minutes later, Fortis entered the agent's office.\n\n\n\n\u201cAgent Wolf, am I right?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYes.......who are you?\u00a0\u00a0And why are you red?\u201d\n\n\n\nWithout warning, the junior guard emptied a full can of blue paint on the agent.\n\n\n\n\u201cI found him boys!\u00a0\u00a0Get him!\u201d\n\n\n\nAgent Wolf had a second to register surprise as a squad of solid red army personell filled the room and riddled his torso with clay bullets.\n\n\n\nFortis couldn't help but smile to himself as he reentered Site 19's Surviellance Room.\u00a0\u00a0He changed back into his uniform and stached the red one.\u00a0\u00a0He had already washed off the paint, all that was left was to make sure no one else entered the area.\u00a0\u00a0He idly examined the monkey statue that was waiting for him on the console, slightly bemused at the thought of a junior guard entering the ranks of Senior Staff.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nLinguistics/Supernatural Researcher Veldi had seemingly not participated in the contest, although he had been seen carting tomatoes all over the facility and setting them down at random. After emptying the cart, he retrieved SCP-005 from storage, and accessed an area from which he could work his magic.\n\n\n\nWith an enormous grin plastered on his face, Veldi spoke into the intercom.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat happens when 682 gets heartburn? \u2026.. Absolutely nothing, the Lizard doesn\u2019t get heartburn!\u201d\n\n\n\nIn that moment, dozens and dozens of SCP-504 splattered into speakers, personnel and everything in general.\n\n\n\n\u201cI freaking love these tomatoes.\u201d Veldi checked the video feed to his office. Yup, there was the monkey, on his desk. Of course, there was the issue that he now had a PC instead of a MacBook...\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nAs soon as the prank wars started, SCP-738 was Junior Researcher Gille's first destination. It followed contracts steadily, nevermind the side consequences. Nothing he was going to do would harm him THAT much.\n\n\n\nThe contract? Get the monkey of the last person to have it, and transport it to the middle of the Senior Break room.\n\n\n\nSecond destination: The Senior Break room. From there, it would be rigged with 20 paintball guns, all set to fire when the sensor picks up movement in a circle around the Monkey. Then, when someone inevitably gets pelted, he walks in and grabs the Monkey.\n\n\n\nThird destination: His secret hiding spot, outfitted with a view of all the places he will need to be at.\n\n\n\nFourth destination: SCP-682's storage area. Considering it's been let free, but it's still the safest place on the site, that should be a logical place to store it. Hidden in the third drawer of his desk, however, are 3 pistols, fully loaded no less, with 5 clips, and rations to last 2 days. It pays to be prepared for this day.\n\n\n\nBefore leaving, Gille remembered to put a bucket of spiders on the door too his office. Someone will inevitably think to check there once he gets the monkey, so this should discourage them.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.\"\n\n\n\n\"Not at all. Between you and me, dealing with amateurs day in and day out is so tedious.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm sure. Now you know that one of our little annual celebrations is coming up soon, and it occured to me that one or more of my colleagues may come to you for help. I would appreciate it if you might extend me certain professional courtesies around that.\"\n\n\n\n\"Sir, are you suggesting that I breach confidentiality? I do have some scruples.\"\n\n\n\n\"Of course not! Wouldn't think of it. But perhaps you could take, let's say, the broadest possible interpretation of the agreed-upon terms.\"\n\n\n\n\"You want the monkey for yourself?\"\n\n\n\n\"Since you bring it up, what compensation would you want, in exchange for my permanent posession of said monkey?\"\n\n\n\nThe humanoid figure behind the desk beckons and the smaller man before the desk leans forward. He whispers something in his ear.\n\n\n\n\"Interesting. Not at all what I'd expected. And I must say that, while I'm flattered that you offer, I'm very happy to work for the Foundation, and don't contemplate a change anytime soon. Let me make a proposal of my own. In exchange for the aforesaid professional courtesies leading to temporary possession...\"\n\n\n\nIt takes some time, but eventually the human and the entity wearing the face of a legendary law professor reach an agreement. A secretary is summoned from the accounting department, sworn to secrecy, duly threatened with death, and made to witness an agreement that bursts into flames the moment the formalities are complete.\n\n\n\nSheldon Katz and the entity shake hands.\n\n\n\nAcross the site, in a specially rigged broom closet, Junior Researcher Gille watches the Senior Break room on screen, then 682's pen, then his office, then back to the break room. Nothing. Wait. Something.\n\n\n\nSomething rushes into the room, something about knee-high and very fast, something with a single bright blue eye in the middle of its bulbous yellow body. It's dribbling a smaller object in front of it like a soccer ball. As it pauses on the periphery of the circle of paintball guns, the \"ball\" comes to rest. It's a statuette of a monkey.\n\n\n\nResearcher Veldi runs into the room, panting and red-faced. The Eye-Pod skitters away from him. Veldi lunges, and a chase ensues around the edges of the room, with the Eye-Pod and the monkey always staying just out of Veldi's reach.\n\n\n\nAfter four circuits of the room, the Eye-Pod makes a sudden break to the right. Veldi leaps, trying to tackle it, and trips over his own feet. On the floor, he hears a series of clicks followed immediately by splatting sounds, and wonders for a moment if he somehow missed some tomatoes. He picks himself up, and observes that the walls of the break room have a new paint job in the style of Jackson Pollock.\n\n\n\nThe Eye-Pod scurries out of the break room and heads down a corridor, rolling the monkey down the hall still. Gille jumps up from his seat and sprints down the hall. He figures if he goes down corridor 37, then makes a sharp right just before the firehose he can head them off--yes! Here they are, and he's just a pace behind Veldi. He drops his head and starts running as fast as he can.\n\n\n\n\"You think that's funny? I hate running,\" says Veldi between gasps.\n\n\n\nThe researchers sprint after the Eye-Pod, neither gaining any real advantage or getting any closer. They follow it now left, now right, now a long straightaway and into a dead end, a small chamber at the end of a long corridor. Gille jumps on the monkey and Veldi jumps on Gille. They grapple on the floor, neither noticing the Eye-Pod backing out of the room until they hear the door start to close. Gille looks up just in time to notice a third figure in the room: humanoid, but made of concrete and covered in spray paint.\n\n\n\nIn the awkward silence that ensues, the disappearance of the monkey barely registers on them.\n\n\n\nFinally Veldi says: \"I've got to blink on three. One...two...\"\n\n\n\nKatz notes the monkey statue that now sits atop his empty inbox. He's already senior staff, but his secretary is out sick and nobody from the temp pool can seem to ever type up his briefs just the way he likes them. He looks through the stack of neatly-formatted documents before him and nods in satisfaction. Yes, the devil will have his due, but he does love a nice-looking brief. Worth it.\n\n\n\nHe picks up the monkey and goes into the hallway outside his office, waiting for someone going in the right direction who looks sufficiently junior and sufficiently gullible. Soon enough, a cub researcher who he doesn't recognize passes by, and Sheldon intercepts him.\n\n\n\n\"Excuse me, young man, could I ask a favor? Someone left this in my office and they need it for a team-building exercise in the main cafeteria. Just take it up there and someone will show you what to do next.\"\n\n\n\nHe feels slightly bad, watching the eager youth hurry down the hall with the monkey, but better him than Sheldon, and in any case this will teach him a number of valuable lessons.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nDoctor Briar sighed, looking over the contents of his small office. It had been a long, hard road to get here. So many times, he'd thought he would die. So many times, he had lost what he thought of as \"everything\", only to build himself up so he would have something else to lose when the time came again. It had certainly not been easy, but he'd managed, somehow...\n\n\n\nHe always wished it could have been easier, though. If only there had been some way he could have made his journey to a respected member of senior staff without having to endure so much suffering. Of course, he had only been a low-level recruit in the Foundation when they stopped holding the Staff Prank Wars. He had heard of them, of course, and how the cleverest member of the Foundation's personnel stood to be raised to Senior Staff for winning. It was truly a shame that he had been so new when they held the last of them, an all but nameless lab assistant, not trusted with anything more important than proofreading documents...but then, that was his advantage, wasn't it?\n\n\n\nBriar smiled, looking at the assembled items and documents sitting on his desk. At the top of the pile was a death certificate. Just another Foundation employee that had finally met his end, but to the elderly man at the desk, an opportunity. After all, permanent ownership didn't extend past death. Most importantly, however, was the small locked box on top of the pile. There were so many anomalous objects with temporal effects in Foundation custody that they hardly bothered to catalogue them all. No one would notice he had \"borrowed\" SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 among a batch of other research materials, and the letter he planned to mail would not be going anywhere that it would be looked for. Chuckling to himself, Doctor Briar took out a fountain pen, and began to write.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nYears earlier, a much younger version of the same man breathed heavily, hiding in a cubical and shaking. In his hand he held a much-folded piece of heavy parchment, written upon in flowing calligraphy. Nervous, he muttered the words aloud as he re-read the page, \"Volunteer to assist in accounting. Short-staffed due to people calling in sick to avoid the contest. Agree to witness a contract. False name. Render null and void...\"\n\n\n\nHe shook his head in disbelief, dizzy with the implications. It couldn't be that easy, could it? Of course, he had barely dared believe what he held in his hands until the prank war began to unfold, exactly as the note claimed it would. Still, it seemed too good to be true. A deal with the Devil shouldn't be so simple to thwart, even if it wasn't //really// the Devil. Of course, the plan wasn't over yet. Just botching Katz's deal wouldn't much of a prank by itself, after all. Steeling himself, the younger Briar stepped out of the cubical, and announced that he was going on his lunch break. As he entered into the corridor, he put on a ring, and pulled out the small electronic device from his pocket.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nAt the doors of the cafeteria, a young researcher was stopped by a polite cough. He turned, his face guileless and smiling. A dark-haired man snatched the bundle out of his hands before he had a moment to react.\n\n\n\n\"Oh, thank goodness I caught you in time! I am SO sorry! It seems that my colleague gave you the wrong article by mistake. //This// is the one they need in there.\"\n\n\n\nA small device was pressed into the researcher's hands. He babbled for a few moments about how glad he was to help, and how sorry he was that the other man had to chase him all the way here. Briar, in turn, made his excuses, politely stating that it was no trouble, but he really had to get back to work. He gave the hapless researcher some basic instructions on how to set up the device, and told him to just \"get it started for them\". As he hurried to return SCP-399 to containment, he could hear his modified MP3 player begin to loop Rick Astley's most famous composition with enough bass to shake the light fixtures. The altered lyrics, bragging of the genius of one Sheldon Katz, could just barely be made out from where he stood. Since he didn't have an office, Briar made a note to check his locker later on.\n\n\n\n-------\n\n\n\nA D-Class that had been fortunate enough to avoid all of the chaos of the day was desperately looking for a place to hide. He found an isolated cell, and quickly opened the door, failing to notice the number \"173\" emblazoned above the door.\n\n\n\nThe moment the door was fully open, he stepped through the frame. He saw two men on the floor, and then he looked up.\n\n\n\nHe recognized the sculpture a few seconds too late.\n\n\n\nVeldi and Gille charged him, threw him in the cell, and quickly closed the door. The sound of bones breaking followed shortly after.\n\n\n\nVeldi breathed a sigh of relief. \"Well, that was fun. Next time, let's check doors before going in them. Don't want Blinky to be let out.\"\n\n\n\nGille was shivering from the experience. Veldi leaned down. \"Oh, by the way... I think ahead.\" He pointed out that the wall opposite 173's containment had been painted red. Gille was still in a stupor, so Veldi walked away and pressed a button on his phone. A tinny, electronic voice came from above the door: \"Leggo my Eggo-carrying Lego Winnebago full of\u2013\" The sound was cut short by a wall of tomato juice.\n\n\n\nVeldi checked the video feed on his phone again. Yep, the monkey was on his desk. He figured that he should set some more traps so that it wouldn't stay away for long. He hurried to his supplies.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nVeldi returned to his office, hoping that some son-of-a-bitch hadn't gotten there before him. He set his supplies down, opened the door, and glanced at his hard-won prize...\n\n\n\nAnd there was no monkey statue. He checked again. Whoever had run off with it had left a note. Hoping it didn't have some G\u2588d-awful cognitohazard, he read:\n\n\n\n//Unless properly defended, your monkey statue is __my__ monkey statue. See you later, noob.//\n\n//~ Agent Gummy Dragon//\n\n\n\nImpossible! You couldn't just //take// the statue. you had to //earn// it. Veldi searched his office in a panic. He opened his cabinets...\n\n\n\nAnd a small puppy stared him in the eye.\n\n\n\nAnd that puppy's excited barking brought puppies out of the drawers, trashcan, and hallway. Veldi couldn't take it, and ran screaming from the adorable mob of canines pursuing him.\n\n\n\nGummy laughed as he viewed the security feed from his office. Sending [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-662 Mr. Deeds] to hide the statue behind a potted plant, fill Veldi's office with puppies, and plant the note he had written, all while Veldi was out, had been easier than expected. Gummy had barricaded his office door and stocked up on sandwiches and water bottles, so he should have been safe.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nDr. Len Blue frantically pushed a large storage cart out into an open field outside Site-19 after \"taking a week off.\" He was, if nothing else, determined to get that damned monkey.\n\n\n\nOver the past week, he had stolen the flying pig, as detailed under the Log of Anomalous Items, from Site-18 and used SCP-038 to make almost a hundred duplicates before returning the original. He had stolen SCP-000-J from Professor Snider while he was away and quickly returned it after ordering SCP-184. He had stolen multiple Scranton Reality Buoys from a manufacturing facility. He had bought large amounts of wood, cardboard, ropes, pillows, blankets, bread, water, hog feed, fireworks, slingshots, and iron pellets. And now, he was going to pull of the most legendary prank of all time.\n\n\n\nHe stopped the cart right in front of a large structure covered in green tarp and yanked it down, revealing a very large play fort, three and a half meters wide, constructed of wood, pillows and cardboard, decorated with castle turrets and containing six rooms: a central room filled with computer equipment and containing a generator, a barracks for the pigs with multiple hammocks, an armory full of fireworks and slingshots with ammunition, a storehouse full of stolen rations, bread, water, and hog feed, a hangar for the launch of armed flying pigs, and a room containing four Scranton Reality Buoys suspended in the middle of the room with ropes, with wires attached to it.\n\n\n\nDr. Blue, exhausted, unloaded bags of animate, plastic flying pigs from the overturned cart and dumped them into the hammocks after taking them in. Then, he hauled in SCP-184, still attached to its electromagnet, dropped it in the control room, and called Agent Gummy Dragon.\n\n\n\nHe began the conversation. \"This is your last chance, Agent. Come out and surrender the monkey or I'll unleash my latest work of magic: the unstoppable, growing Expand-O-Fort. Site-19 will be torn asunder by my trained armies of cybernetic flying pigs, and I will have the monkey in the end.\"\n\n\"Do it, then. If it's so unstoppable, I'd like to see you actually unleash it,\" replied Gummy. And at that, he hung up, and spliced into the security feed of the grasslands outside Site-19.\n\n\n\nDr. Blue turned off the electromagnet, and SCP-184 began expanding the interior walls of the fort. But the Scranton Reality Buoys nullified the physically impossible interior-only effect of SCP-184, and the entire fort expanded. Released from this effect, which had to expend energy bending spacetime, the fort could expand very quickly and immediately after SCP-184 entered it.\n\n\n\nAgent Gummy Dragon could only watch in horror as the fortress expanded a meter in two seconds and kept going even faster. But he knew he was in a bad spot here. If he called any kind of authority about this, everyone at Site-19 would be disciplined for the prank war. With no other options, he used his conference phone to call Dr. Bright, Dr. Veldi, Dr. Clef, and Agent Strelnikov, explained the situation frantically.\n\n\n\nDr. Clef, mortified, responded, \"No.\" After a long pause, he said, \"He has 184.\"\n\n\n\nEveryone collectively gasped. \"I'm calling an MTF,\" said Dr. Clef. \"Bright and Veldi, get EMP grenades, take a jeep and get into that fortress as fast as you can. Strelnikov, get to a machine gun tower and set that thing on fire with tracers. Gummy, hold on to that monkey, and keep it away from Blue as long as possible.\" And at that, Dr. Clef hung up.\n\n\n\nThe fortress was already forty meters wide, having taken on a pyramid shape, and new rooms were forming. Dr. Blue's army of computer-controlled pigs was mutating and growing. Dr. Blue keyed in a command, and hundreds of winged pigs spewed out of a large hangar in the side of the fortress. Agent Strelnikov reached the top of a guard tower with hundreds of incendiary tracers and loaded them into the heavy machine gun turret. Leaning out the window, he opened fire on the tip of the fortress, setting the top of it on fire.\n\n\n\nThe Jeep shot out of the gates of Site-19. Dr. Blue, not worried, locked the hundreds of three-inch fully functional winged pigs onto their Jeep. Dr. Veldi pulled an EMP grenade out of his pocket and threw it into the swarm, disabling almost all of their robotic implants and causing them to fly off in all directions. Moments later, it crashed full force into a sliding door made of abnormally dense pillows.\n\n\n\nWhen Bright and Veldi recovered, they found themselves inside a hangar of computer-controlled toy pigs made entirely of fireworks. In the back of the room was a door, three slingshots made of pillows, and an iron computer manual.\n\n\n\n\"Come on!,\" yelled Dr. Bright, running for the door. \"We have to go deeper!\"\n\n\n\nThe doctors suddenly found themselves in a room containing a single two-meter-wide Scranton Reality Buoy, composed entirely of cardboard. Dr. Veldi threw an EMP grenade into it. The grenade punched through the SRB and came right out the other side before detonating. The entire buoy then collapsed as though it was made of rigid paper.\n\n\n\nThen, suddenly, everything around the two doctors collapsed, destroying several more SRBs around them, resulting in a chain reaction that tore through the outside of the fort.\n\n\n\nBright and Veldi survived, and the Expand-O-Fort was collapsed. It appeared that SCP-184 had been turned off. The pigs were mostly deactivated and fell from the sky, and helicopters from MTF Psi-7 \"Home Improvement\" cleaned up the rest.\n\n\n\nAnd Dr. Blue wasn't in the fort. The whole time, he had been waiting for the fort to get big enough for him to shut off SCP-184 and then use all of its power reserves to teleport the monkey into his hands. He was riding a seven-foot robotic toy flying pig away from the rubble, carrying Doctors Bright and Veldi with him on a 50-pound rope made of slingshots which\u00a0\u00a0SCP-050 had affixed to the pig as a prank, before transferring to Dr. Veldi, pranking him by setting off one of his EMP grenades, and then back to Dr. Blue. And then the deactivated pig crashed.\n\n\n\nLater, after a lot of amnestic spraying and Dr. Blue's reassignment, Dr. Bright discovered the monkey in his locker.\n\n------\n", "references": ["scp-447", "scp-297"], "tags": ["agent-lament", "collaboration", "doctor-bright", "doctor-clef", "kain-pathos-crow", "sheldon-katz", "tale"], "title": "Senior Staff Shenanigans - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/seniorstaffshenanigans", "year": 2011}, "shark-tale": {"created_at": "2011-10-26T15:16:00", "creator": "Tanhony", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Tanhony", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/tanhony", "comment": "", "date": "2011-10-26T15:16:00"}, {"author": "Tanhony", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/tanhony", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

Its director, the bearded, bespectacled Dr. Sanders, was \u201cthe Colonel\u201d (though never to his face). And the building designated General Non-Anomalous Testing and Containment (GNATC) was \u201cGranny\u2019s Attic\u201d.

That tour bus of Mexican pilgrims to Guadalupe who had been contained on suspicion of having been infected by a dangerous meme? Heavily dosed with amnestics and dropped off at the roadside. Who knows, maybe some of them made it back home to the loved ones who had last seen them eleven years ago.</p>\n<p>In theory. In practice, processing non-anomalous items was the kind of duty that none of the Site-33 researchers seemed to ever really get around to doing. There was too much interesting work to be done on the SCP-level objects, you see.

This office was normally vacant, but from time to time the Colonel would assign personnel there, more as penance or to get someone out of the way than in order to ensure the fulfillment of the duties of that office.

nicknames.\u00a0\u00a0Site-33 itself, of course, was \u201cRolling Rock\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0Its director, the bearded, bespectacled Dr. Sanders, was \u201cthe Colonel\u201d (though never to his face).\u00a0\u00a0And the building designated General Non-Anomalous Testing and Containment (GNATC) was \u201cGranny\u2019s Attic\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0If the Foundation was in possession of a specimen or an object that turned out to not be anomalous-that is to say, safer than Safe-well, it generally ended up in the Attic.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n> //Designation: BDH-483\n\n> Description: A

another.\u00a0\u00a0That glowing worm that turned out to be a bioluminescent animal unknown to science but otherwise uninteresting?\u00a0\u00a0Released back into the cave where it had been found.\u00a0\u00a0That tour bus of Mexican pilgrims to Guadalupe who had been contained on suspicion of having been infected by a dangerous meme?\u00a0\u00a0Heavily dosed with amnestics and dropped off at the roadside.\u00a0\u00a0Who knows, maybe some of them made it back home to the loved ones who had last seen them eleven years ago.\n\n\n\nIn theory.\u00a0\u00a0In practice, processing non-anomalous items was the kind of duty that none of the Site-33 researchers seemed to ever really get around to doing.\u00a0\u00a0There was too much interesting work to be done on the SCP-level objects, you see.\u00a0\u00a0And so, an object in the Attic tended to stay in the Attic.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n> //Designation: HFR-019\n\n> Description: A live, healthy, unblemished cow, red in

running the Attic.\u00a0\u00a0This office was normally vacant, but from time to time the Colonel would assign personnel there, more as penance or to get someone out of the way than in order to ensure the fulfillment of the duties of that office.\u00a0\u00a0In this case, Savonarola had (according to the Colonel) bungled the containment protocol of Site-33\u2019s colony of SCP-831.\u00a0\u00a0(\u201cHow was I supposed to know that D-29934 had a loose dental filling?\u201d).\u00a0\u00a0Before the napalm had even been hosed away, it was \u201coff to the PB with you, Jerry.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe a tour of duty in the Attic for a few weeks will remind you to follow protocol to the letter.\u201d\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n> //Designation: ANG-1430-G\n\n> Description: A

Her mother shoots her the briefest of looks, and drops her offering on the table. The tiny coins clink in the iron dish, the pipe organ plays a handful of solemn notes, the seats creak as all the others sits back down, and then everything is still and silent as the fat man on the podium inhales enough air to get his disgusting, reedy voice working.\n<p>\u201cBrothers and Sisters, let us bow our heads in prayer.\u201d</p>\n<p>The little girl hesitates a moment, before her mother grabs the back of her head and forces her down.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026And behold, The Lord spoke unto me, in a voice both soft and terrible, but was silent to the unbeliever. The Lord spoke 'Come', and I did, and I was afraid and fell to my knees, weeping. I rose my hands, and asked 'O, mighty Lord, what has become of thy body? Why have you been undone?' The Lord said unto me 'Go, and restore me to glory, and I shall restore you in turn'. The voice of God spoke to my heart, and I wept at both the Glory and the Shame of The Heart of our Lord! Thus I came to know his Heart and his Word, and I swore the blood of my family in his service! Amen!\u201d The man at the podium's voice is almost a screech by the time he finishes, overcome with emotion and religious fervor.</p>\n<p>\u201cAmen,\u201d the crowd roars back. An old man in the pew to the left of the girl stamps his feet. The girl opens a single cautious eye and stares at the mass of clockwork jutting out of his legs for a minute before her mother applies more pressure and she's quickly forced to shut her eyes again.</p>\n<p>\u201cBrothers and Sisters!\u201d The laugh and smile enters the preacher's voice. \u201cRaise your heads. This is not a time for weeping and gnashing of teeth. This is a day of celebration.\u201d</p>\n<p>The congregation cautiously raises their heads; they've been tested in this way before. Even the young girl remembers the time when the Father announced a 'Trial of Faith' and had those who looked up after the opening prayer killed.</p>\n<p>\u201cRise, rise! Look and rejoice, people of the Steel. A month ago, the Faithful found a hated\u2026 Foundation\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Here, he stops and spits on the floor. A few of the older members of the Church do as well.</p>\n<p>\u201cFoundation agent snooping around our abbey! Bring him in, Brother Adjutants.\u201d</p>\n<p>Two men in flowing black robes and face masks made of iron enter from a back room, slamming aside a large oak door and dragging a man in rags. In their free hands they carry cruel spears. The girl makes a tiny noise of fear before her mother slaps her on the thigh, making her jump slightly.</p>\n<p>The congregation laughs when the man, hunched with pain and hunger, stumbles on the stairs up to the stage and podium. His ragged beard speaks of long days in captivity, and his blue eyes burn with a cool flame of anger.</p>\n<p>The Father stands and flourishes his robe. \u201cNow, rather than have our practiced Adjutants end this dog's life, High Priest Frick would like us to use this heretic as a trial for the newest and youngest member of our order. Young Lady Tau, please come here.\u201d</p>\n<p>The little girl \u2013 the Lady Tau in question \u2013 freezes. She hugs the rabbit as close to her chest as possible. Her mother shoots her a half-smile, pleased with her. She tugs the rabbit out of her grasp, and shoos her into the aisle.</p>\n<p>Tau just stands there. Her mother utters a chuckle.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe is nervous.\u201d</p>\n<p>The congregation laughs, and the fat priest's smile grows wider. He extends a hand in the direction of the girl.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome, child.\u201d</p>\n<p>She slowly advances, going around and up the stairs, and then reluctantly takes the man's hand. Here, she can hear the heavy breathing of the men in the masks behind her.</p>\n<p>\u201cToday, we welcome Lady Tau into the Order of the Black Cog, and that of The Broken God.\u201d</p>\n<p>He turns, still smiling, and nods to one of the masked men. \u201cDo it.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Adjutant nods, and crouches down behind Tau. She turns, and the man's spear is dropped into her hands, nearly knocking her over.</p>\n<p>The priest crouches down as well and whispers in her ear. \u201cDo your duty to your God.\u201d</p>\n<p>Everyone on the stage backs away from Tau. Suddenly, she is acutely aware of both the ragged man on his knees in front of her and his hazy breath.</p>\n<p>He looks at her. She stares back.</p>\n<p>He speaks. \u201cLook me in the eye.\u201d</p>\n<p>She does so.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow.\u201d</p>\n<p>He nods at her, resigned.</p>\n<p>\u201cKill me. Or they will kill you.\u201d</p>\n<p>There is a pregnant silence, an intake of breath. Tau looks down at the weapon in her hands, then at the man again. He closes his eyes, mumbles a few words, and then inhales, waiting.</p>\n<p>She clumsily thrusts the spear into his stomach. He winces, gapes, then moans. Tau flinches. She withdraws, stabs again, this time slightly higher. Blood leaks from between the wounds and he coughs, spattering Tau's white dress with red.

Her mother shoots her the briefest of looks, and drops her offering on the table. The tiny coins clink in the iron dish, the pipe organ plays a handful of solemn notes, the seats creak as all the others sits back down, and then everything is still and silent as the fat man on the podium inhales enough air to get his disgusting, reedy voice working. \n\n\n\n\u201cBrothers and Sisters, let us bow our heads in prayer.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe little girl hesitates a moment, before her mother grabs the back of her head and forces her down.\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026And behold, The Lord spoke unto me, in a voice both soft and terrible, but was silent to the unbeliever. The Lord spoke 'Come', and I did, and I was afraid and fell to my knees, weeping. I rose my hands, and asked 'O, mighty Lord, what has become of thy body? Why have you been undone?' The Lord said unto me 'Go, and restore me to glory, and I shall restore you in turn'. The voice of God spoke to my heart, and I wept at both the Glory and the Shame of The Heart of our Lord! Thus I came to know his Heart and his Word, and I swore the blood of my family in his service! Amen!\u201d The man at the podium's voice is almost a screech by the time he finishes, overcome with emotion and religious fervor.\n\n\n\n\u201cAmen,\u201d the crowd roars back. An old man in the pew to the left of the girl stamps his feet. The girl opens a single cautious eye and stares at the mass of clockwork jutting out of his legs for a minute before her mother applies more pressure and she's quickly forced to shut her eyes again.\n\n\n\n\u201cBrothers and Sisters!\u201d The laugh and smile enters the preacher's voice. \u201cRaise your heads. This is not a time for weeping and gnashing of teeth. This is a day of celebration.\u201d \n\n\n\nThe congregation cautiously raises their heads; they've been tested in this way before. Even the young girl remembers the time when the Father announced a 'Trial of Faith' and had those who looked up after the opening prayer killed.\n\n\n\n\u201cRise, rise! Look and rejoice, people of the Steel. A month ago, the Faithful found a hated... Foundation...\u201d\n\n\n\nHere, he stops and spits on the floor. A few of the older members of the Church do as well.\n\n\n\n\u201cFoundation agent snooping around our abbey! Bring him in, Brother Adjutants.\u201d\n\n\n\nTwo men in flowing black robes and face masks made of iron enter from a back room, slamming aside a large oak door and dragging a man in rags. In their free hands they carry cruel spears. The girl makes a tiny noise of fear before her mother slaps her on the thigh, making her jump slightly.\n\n\n\nThe congregation laughs when the man, hunched with pain and hunger, stumbles on the stairs up to the stage and podium. His ragged beard speaks of long days in captivity, and his blue eyes burn with a cool flame of anger.\n\n\n\nThe Father stands and flourishes his robe. \u201cNow, rather than have our practiced Adjutants end this dog's life, High Priest Frick would like us to use this heretic as a trial for the newest and youngest member of our order. Young Lady Tau, please come here.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe little girl \u2013 the Lady Tau in question \u2013 freezes. She hugs the rabbit as close to her chest as possible. Her mother shoots her a half-smile, pleased with her. She tugs the rabbit out of her grasp, and shoos her into the aisle. \n\n\n\nTau just stands there. Her mother utters a chuckle.\n\n\n\n\u201cShe is nervous.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe congregation laughs, and the fat priest's smile grows wider. He extends a hand in the direction of the girl.\n\n\n\n\u201cCome, child.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe slowly advances, going around and up the stairs, and then reluctantly takes the man's hand. Here, she can hear the heavy breathing of the men in the masks behind her.\n\n\n\n\u201cToday, we welcome Lady Tau into the Order of the Black Cog, and that of The Broken God.\u201d \n\n\n\nHe turns, still smiling, and nods to one of the masked men. \u201cDo it.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Adjutant nods, and crouches down behind Tau. She turns, and the man's spear is dropped into her hands, nearly knocking her over. \n\n\n\nThe priest crouches down as well and whispers in her ear. \u201cDo your duty to your God.\u201d\n\n\n\nEveryone on the stage backs away from Tau. Suddenly, she is acutely aware of both the ragged man on his knees in front of her and his hazy breath.\n\n\n\nHe looks at her. She stares back.\n\n\n\nHe speaks. \u201cLook me in the eye.\u201d \n\n\n\nShe does so. \n\n\n\n\u201cNow.\u201d \n\n\n\nHe nods at her, resigned. \n\n\n\n\u201cKill me. Or they will kill you.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere is a pregnant silence, an intake of breath. Tau looks down at the weapon in her hands, then at the man again. He closes his eyes, mumbles a few words, and then inhales, waiting.\n\n\n\nShe clumsily thrusts the spear into his stomach. He winces, gapes, then moans. Tau flinches. She withdraws, stabs again, this time slightly higher. Blood leaks from between the wounds and he coughs, spattering Tau's white dress with red. She realizes she must have hit him in a lung.\n\n\n\nHe falls, cold blue eyes glassing up. Tau looks down at the spear in her hands, before the man in the mask reappears and takes it from her. He pats her on the back, as if he were burping a child. \n\n\n\nSomewhere, far away, she hears the priest's voice, echoing over the silence in the room and in her head.\n\n\n\n\u201cLo, behold and tremble, for this is the least terrible fate of the Betrayer. To betray The Lord is to bring wrath of both the People and the Body of God, and both will seek holy and terrible vengeance...\u201d\n", "references": [], "tags": ["broken-god", "featured", "tale"], "title": "Sunday Service - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sunday-service", "year": 2011}, "surprise-happy-birthday": {"created_at": "2011-08-19T04:47:00", "creator": "TroyL", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Happy Birthday!", "date": "2011-08-19T04:47:00"}, {"author": "ToxicClay", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/toxicclay", "comment": "", "date": "2011-08-19T04:50:00"}, {"author": "Pig_catapult", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pig-catapult", "comment": "", "date": "2011-08-19T05:08:00"}, {"author": "Pig_catapult", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/pig-catapult", "comment": "of/off error", "date": "2011-08-19T05:16:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "", "date": "2011-08-19T05:21:00"}, {"author": "Salman Corbette", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/salman-corbette", "comment": "", "date": "2011-08-19T06:35:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "", "date": "2011-08-19T20:23:00"}, {"author": "Dexanote", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dexanote", "comment": "", "date": "2011-08-20T03:12:00"}, {"author": "Dexanote", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dexanote", "comment": "", "date": "2011-08-20T03:12:00"}, {"author": "Dexanote", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dexanote", "comment": "", "date": "2011-08-20T03:15:00"}, {"author": "Dexanote", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dexanote", "comment": "", "date": "2011-08-20T03:17:00"}, {"author": "Dexanote", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dexanote", "comment": "", "date": "2011-08-20T03:57:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "", "date": "2011-08-20T07:34:00"}, {"author": "thedeadlymoose", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/thedeadlymoose", "comment": "added dr. toxic and lady catfish", "date": "2011-08-20T23:15:00"}, {"author": "The Raven", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/the-raven", "comment": "", "date": "2011-08-21T04:46:00"}, {"author": "The Raven", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/the-raven", "comment": "Added mine.", "date": "2011-08-21T04:46:00"}, {"author": "Sophia Light", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sophia-light", "comment": "Happy Birthday, gears!", "date": "2011-08-21T05:33:00"}, {"author": "Sophia Light", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sophia-light", "comment": "Teeny bit of reorienting :)", "date": "2011-08-21T05:43:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Blergh.

Tales with two faces, stories that don't and do mean at the same time, and the occasional tug at the heart string. Stories of men with needle teeth, or a horse who tells the future, or a duck whose quack echoes. Perhaps a skull who speaks all your fears, the tomb of the Czar's dead wives, or a chandelier made of bones. Who can say? All I can tell you for sure is\u2026</p>\n<p>Happy Birthday\u2026!

It wasn\u2019t like the dozens of other cross-stitchings she\u2019d worked on over the years, all the samplers and patterns she\u2019d completed and discarded. Box after box of the stupid things were sitting in her attic, all working towards this one. Those were just practice; a past time. This one was a true thing of beauty\u2026</p>\n<p>He was still murmuring, still trying to move the tongue that was no longer there. It would have ruined the elegant long-stitches over his lips. Even worse would have been the screaming, but the wires laced through his jaw took care of that. His hands were perfectly stitched together with French loops, looking almost elegant in their flowing pattern. He was beautiful.

Place used to be part of the Soviet Union before it fell to pieces. We were at a tiny village, just on the crest of a beautiful cliff. At least, it was beautiful if you could ignore the pile of fresh corpses at the bottom.</p>\n<p>It was like they had all just up and walked off the edge, like lemmings. Everyone in the village. It was our job to find out why. We went in in full Hazmat suits, to be safe. All the houses were empty, as if their occupants had just stepped out for a while. It was creepy. Only place left was the church. My partner and I drew the short straw, and went in. It was a simple, one-room affair, with a dirt floor. There were some sticks and rocks littered around the altar, so we moved in closer, to check behind it.</p>\n<p>That's where we found him.</p>\n<p>The poor boy was wearing rags, covered in bruises and cuts, and I realised that there was dried blood on some of the stones and branches around him. He couldn't have been more than seven years old. He looked up at me with the widest, saddest, most terrified eyes I've ever seen. They weren't human eyes. They were too yellow.</p>\n<p>He was clawing at his own throat. The boy had wickedly sharp nails, but his tolerance to pain wasn't high enough for him to bring them close enough to sever anything vital. A choked sob escaped him, and those impossibly-wide eyes widened even more. He gasped, and clamped both his bloodied hands over his mouth. That's when I really noticed the feathers. They were growing forward out of his wrists, sticking out over the backs and sides of his hands. Was he what caused this, or was he a victim, too?</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked in my best Russian, which wan't very good. He shook his head, eyes never leaving mine. My partner was already radioing in for backup and medical assistance.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cThis is Six. We found\u2026 <strong>something</strong> behind the altar. Humanoid. It's injured.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Good old Ashley. Always so cold and professional. I know I should be, too, but\u2026 I mean, I can do my job, you know, but sometimes I find myself feeling sorry for the weird creatures we lock up. Some of 'em, anyway. This kid's\u2026 <em>almost</em> human\u2026 right?</p>\n<p>The med fellas came in, along with the rest of the containment team. Emmy had gotten her memo pad out again, probably scribbling down information that was gonna go in the mission report later, when the boy reached out toward her. The kid instantly had at least four guns trained at his head. He shrank back against the side of the altar.</p>\n<p>\u201cDammit, guys!\u201d Eddy \u2013 he was one of the med fellas \u2013 snapped at them. \u201cI'm <em>trying</em> to bandage this thing's neck, which is <em>kinda hard</em> when it's moving around.\u201d</p>\n<p>Emmy must have given the kid an idea, because he started looking around. He picked one of the smaller sticks and started scrawling something in the dirt with it. The scritch-scratch of Emmy's pen doubled in speed, and I could hear her footsteps as she walked around the altar so she can get a better look.</p>\n<p>\u201c'Sorry,'\u201d she translated aloud as he wrote. \u201c'Not intend hurt. Scared. Sorry sorry sorry.'\u201d She paused a moment. \u201cThe thing's got bad grammar.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat's <em>great,</em> Emmy,\u201d Eddy said, although I don't think Emmy picked up the sarcasm, \u201cand I'm happy for ya, but could ya ask it to <em>hold still, dammit</em> so I can save it's life?\u201d</p>\n<p>Emmy said something that I <em>think's</em> in Russian, and the kid stopped moving, so I guess he understood. The girl's a freaking savant, I swear. Can speak a bazillion languages, but can't read a situation worth beans, and she was still talking. I think she was asking questions, but the kid wasn't answering.</p>\n<p>The flight back started out pretty boring. At least, for everyone that wasn't Emmy. She'd passing notes back and forth with the kid, or something, which I'm sure breaks all sorts of protocols, but from the look that was on her face, it looked like she was getting a pretty good idea of what the hell happened, so maybe she wouldn't get reprimanded too bad. I hope she didn't. She's a sweet girl. Kinda cute. I know I shouldn't be thinking those kinds of things about my co-workers, but she is.</p>\n<p>I think everyone was surprised when Emmy suddenly announced that we all had to break out the earplugs, and <em>now</em>. We obeyed, of course. The kid looked like he was about to start crying again at the gesture; I think we hurt his feelings. Now, I'm no scientist or anything, but by this point I was starting to figure that the kid was refusing to talk for a damn good reason. However it happened, it was probably his voice that killed the villagers, and it could probably kill us, too. No-one else seemed inclined to ask Emmy why, so they were probably thinking the same thing.</p>\n<p>We handed the kid over to the researchers at Site-\u2588\u2588, and Emmy merrily started rattling off to them what she's learned. I was kinda shocked she could be so <em>chipper</em> talking about it, though. What I overheard sounded pretty grim. The villagers had mistaken the kid for a demon when he'd wandered into town looking for food, and were probably trying to exorcise him. When his fear for his own life outweighed his fear of speaking, and he said two words (or, at least, something that translated to two words in English) that, combined with a defensive swing of his arm in what had happened to be in the general direction of the cliff, ultimately led to an entire village of people calmly walking off the ledge to their deaths:</p>\n<p>\"Go away.\"</p>\n<p>I didn't see the kid again until some years later. I'd had an accident that screwed up my leg too bad for me to go back to field work, and got reassigned to paper-pushing at Site-17. He still had some scars from what he'd done to his neck, but there was also a bigger, cleaner one that looked like it had come from a surgery. Given the fact that he was at Site-17 now, I guessed that they'd probably taken out his vocal cords or something. He smiled and waved at me when he saw me. I waved back.</p>\n<p>\u2026 My supervisor saw, and I got reassigned before I even had a chance to get my things into my new old desk.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Unpalatable</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Hope\u00a0your\u00a0cake's\u00a0better</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>\"So what are you doing up here in Saskatchewan?\" asked the truck driver. His beard was rather scruffy and he didn't seem too bright, but he was inviting enough, and friendly. He was nice enough to pick up a hitch hiker, at least.</p>\n<p>\"I'm an investor. I'm heading up north to check out the uranium mines they have going here,\" I replied, watching the hula girl shake on the driver's dashboard.</p>\n<p>\"Why didn'tcha take a plane up?\" the driver asked.</p>\n<p>\"Well I was going to but then that hail storm passed over the city and they said no flights would be leaving in 24 hours. I got a meeting up there in\u2026\" I checked my watch. \"16 hours.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well it is nice to see the countryside, eh?\" The man's gaze shifted to the sky momentarily.</p>\n<p>\"Oh yes, it is very nice.\" I looked up to, only to notice two spinning lights overhead.</p>\n<p>\"Now what wouldja say that is?\" The truck driver could see them too.</p>\n<p>\"I dunno, maybe a chopper or something?\" I gazed at the lights. Odd how they swirled like that. They seemed to get bigger as well.</p>\n<p>\"Nah, if it were a chopper it'd be making noise.\" The truck driver frowned. I looked back at the road to see if there were any other vehicles about. No one else on the lone, flat highway.</p>\n<p>\"Maybe i- Woah shit!\" I was interrupted as the truck driver shifted the wheel sideways. I saw a flash of lights. Two lights, spinning I thought. And then the truck careened off the highway and flipped onto its side, leaving myself and the driver suspended sideways as our seat belts held us tight. I looked down to see a smashed hula girl.</p>\n<p>\"I- augh - I think I broke my arm,\" the truck driver said.</p>\n<p>\"Why the fuck did you do that?!\" My head hurt.</p>\n<p>\"The lights came really close and we were about to smash them.\" The truck driver replied.</p>\n<p>\"Smash lights?\" I asked, but before I could hear an answer I instead heard the sound of smashing glass and a quick ripping noise. I looked up to see the driver gone from his seat and the windshield broken.</p>\n<p>I focused through the windshield to see a blob. It was large, red, and for all intents and purposes could only be described as a blob. It had several tendrils extending from its body, one of which was holding onto the driver. And then I heard the sound of smashing glass and I too was suspended in the air by a slimy, red tendril.</p>\n<p>\"Greetings Earth men!\" said the blob, \"I am Snozerghaslel, food critic of Snasser. My apologies for crashing your vehicle, but i thought that the best way to incapacitate you!\"</p>\n<p>I was too shocked to respond. I looked over at the driver to see him similarly surprised. I looked back at the blob.</p>\n<p>\"Can you hear me? Is my telepathy coming through alright? Hello?\" the blob seemed to jiggle a little. For some unknown reason I decided to nod to communicate that its telepathy was, in fact, coming through.</p>\n<p>\"Ah, good. I thought I should congratulate you, for being the first specimens of a new food craze!\" The blob jiggled some more. \"I've eaten a few Garfhufians in my lifetime, and even a Cragelisalilian, but I have never eaten an Earthling before.\"</p>\n<p>Sudden fear came over me as I realized what it meant. I squirmed a bit, but to no avail.</p>\n<p>\"Squirming just serves to wet my appetite, as you will soon learn. Anyways, let's get to it.\" I watched in terror as the blob opened up a hole in itself that soon filled with what I could only presume to be teeth. He picked up the driver and dropped him in. The driver screamed on the way down then was silenced as the hole closed. I barfed.</p>\n<p>\"Oooh, hmmm, good texture. Oooh, crunchy center.\" I could hear a grinding noise and retched again. \"Ah, I really enjoy that liquid around the crunchy area. Adds a deep contrast that really keeps the taste-arms waving.\"</p>\n<p>I heard a gulping noise and turned green. Then white as I realized I was up next for taste-testing. \"I suppose you're up next, mister squirmy.\"</p>\n<p>The tentacle began to rise up over the mouth-hole, which was once again beginning to open. I screamed. Quite loudly. So loudly the blob had to shake me and tell me to quiet down. I didn't. I had never been as terrified as I was right at that moment.</p>\n<p>Then, just as it began to lower me into the mouth-hole, it stopped.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, wait, what is that after-taste?\" The blob paused and smacked its mouth-hole. \"Oh, that is wretched. That is absolutely vile. It's like, you know, it's like\u2026\" The blob snapped a tendril. \"It's like when you get a really, slimy old sucker stuck in your tongue-ball. That is nauseating. Ugh\"</p>\n<p>The blob then threw me to the ground, slithered to its ship and took off. That night at the uranium site I got the vegetarian burger.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Coffee\u00a0Shops</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Here\u00a0we\u00a0go...</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>On the corner of Westpoint and Main, there\u2019s a big concrete building painted all sorts of vibrant colours. Across the sides, in big red block letters, are the words \u201cGETOUT\u201d. An unusual sight, set against the offices and banks downtown.</p>\n<p>Outside, it looks like some obsessive-compulsive youths took their spray cans in clean strokes to some poor landlord\u2019s warehouse. Inside, the best caf\u00e9 in the city. The Get Out, see? Get Out of your house, go see some friends. All kinds of people come around, from businessmen to students. Excellent reviews, wonderful clientele, and the tastiest damn espresso in the area. The owner makes sure of it.</p>\n<p>Course, it only really took off a couple years ago. See, the owner, Boakes, he was in competition with his older brother for a while. The Elder Boakes had a fabulous little nook over on Sixth, just called Old Caf\u00e9, a couple streets over. Elder was content with his little coffee shop, over near the apartments. I used to come down every day for a tea. Wonderful atmosphere, not too much different from the Get Out. Bit more cozy, a bit warmer. But I digress. Basically, the Elder Boakes got the talent, where the Younger Boakes got the aspirations.</p>\n<p>Anyway, the two of them had a falling out. Shouting matches once a week for months up and down the street. Everyone knew about it. Course, everyone seemed to be on the Elder Boakes\u2019s side. His brother was a bit of a weirdo back then, always angry, you know the type. Rumours said he was some sort of cultist. He doesn\u2019t seem like it any more. He changed a lot.</p>\n<p>One day, the Younger Boakes just packed up and left the city. Nobody really missed him, except his brother. He lived above the caf\u00e9; at night, if you passed by right after closing, you might hear him crying upstairs.</p>\n<p>A few months after his brother left, the Elder Boakes\u2019s caf\u00e9 burned. He was caught inside, the firefighters found his body under some timber. I was actually one of the guys who went in to look for him. I was there, that night that the Old Caf\u00e9 went up in smoke.</p>\n<p>The next day the Younger Boakes appeared downtown, bought a warehouse, and began work on the Get Out. Completely turned around. His hair cut, he was dressed well, a lot of energy and charisma. Never would have guessed that he was that freak from before. Had a new business partner too, some youngish looking fellow. Never got his name. Long hair, pulled back into a ponytail. Always wore a hat.</p>\n<p>\u2026 Can I tell you something?</p>\n<p>The Elder Boakes\u2026 His hands and feet were screwed to a wooden frame. It must have snapped in the heat, the body was folded up like a sandwich. It was horrific. We never let that out, would cause a panic. Nothing like that ever happened before.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve passed by the ruins a few times since, usually walking home from work. One night I turned the corner and I swear, for just a second, I saw that odd guy with the ponytail, under the streetlight, looking at the ruins. I just turned around, went the long way home.</p>\n<p>Maybe the name of the Younger Boakes's caf\u00e9 is not just some modern marketing gimmick. Maybe it's a warning.</p>\n<p>The man had horns.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Dr.\u00a0Toxic\u00a0and\u00a0Lady\u00a0Catfish</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Happy\u00a0birthday,\u00a0Gears!</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Super Marvolo struggles, alone, on the floor of the supervillian's underground laboratory dungeon lair. Bound, trapped, his cape flopping useless on the ground. The chains that bind him are of a dexanite-troinian alloy. The dexanite is one of only three elements in the known universe that he cannot break, and the troinian is slowly sapping his powers and poisoning his blood. He is trapped, with no hope of rescue, unless Marvolo Boy, the Teen Wonder, can escape the deadly electric bear-sharks of Greater Camptos.</p>\n<p>But it is not his own life he is truly worried about. Super Marvolo is as selfless as any hero, and the threat to his own life could not possibly motivate him to struggle as hard as he now does against the dexanite-tronian chains. No, this mysterious, unnamed supervillain has kidnapped the unrequited love of his life, Lady Catfish. Even now, this unnamed supervillain could be doing all manner of cruel, unthinkable things to his dear Lady. Super Marvolo could never forgive himself if\u2026 if\u2026</p>\n<p>Super Marvolo turns all his efforts to breaking his chains. He cannot break them, and yet - he must!</p>\n<p>\"Super Marvolo!\" a hooded figure cackles from the darkness in the shadowy corners of the laboratory dungeon. \"We meet again. For the <em>last</em> time.\"</p>\n<p>The hooded man steps slowly from the shadows. The lights illuminate first his mad, toothy grin, then the contours of his face, then his mad, staring eyes. Super Marvolo gasps in astonishment.</p>\n<p>\"It's \u2026 <em>you</em>!\" Super Marvolo exclaims. \"Dr. Toxic! But you\u2026 you were dead! You were shot between the eyes in the Special Crisis of Heroes!\"</p>\n<p>Dr. Toxic throws back his head and laughs. \"So naive, Super Marvolo! Then again, you always were more brawn than brains.\" Dr. Toxic circles Super Marvolo with menace in his mad eyes. \"Did it never occur to you that during the Special Crisis of Heroes, I was teemed up with Snake Goblin, Master of Illiusions? You only saw\u2026 what I wanted you to see!\"</p>\n<p>\"So you've been behind this all along!\" Super Marvolo stares down Dr. Toxic with his piercing diamond eyes. \"What have you done with Lady Catfish!\"</p>\n<p>Dr. Toxic throws back his head once more, his laughter echoing from the laboratory dungeon rafters. \"You cannot even <em>begin</em> to imagine what\u2014-\"</p>\n<p>The world tilts.</p>\n<p>Super Marvolo collapses on the metallic floor, limp, eyes open, staring at nothing, not even breathing. The rats and spiders and moths in the cages that line Dr. Toxic's laboratory freeze and slump over.</p>\n<p>The world stops.</p>\n<p>Only Dr. Toxic is left moving. The look of mad glee falls from his face and the maniacal smile vanishes.</p>\n<p>\"Please,\" Dr. Toxic says. \"Please. You don't - you don't know what this is. Please, this won't last long. I've been trapped here for \u2026 oh god, I don't know how long anymore.\"</p>\n<p>He glances around, looking for an audience that he cannot see.</p>\n<p>\"Please, <em>please</em>. You have to help me get out. You have no idea what they've made me do. That woman\u2026 what did they call her? Lady Catfish? She's dead. They made me\u2026 they made me kill her, dismember her\u2026 leave her body parts in this hero's bed\u2026 For character development\u2026 and\u2026 the things they had me do to her, before she died\u2026 they made me laugh and they made me <em>like</em> it\u2026\"</p>\n<p>Dr. Toxic forces back tears. \"Their voices in my head, saying this is what audiences want\u2026 want the edgy villains\u2026 real-world violence so the power fantasy has extra spice\u2026\"</p>\n<p>The room is silent. Unmoving. Dr. Toxic glances around, panic setting in on his features. \"You have to do something,\" he says. \"I'm almost out of time! The things they have me do, every day of my life in here - please, please, I'm begging you\u2014 Please!\"</p>\n<p>The double doors of the laboratory dungeon lair burst open. A figure stands silhouetted in the moonlight - a teenage boy, standing tall, cape billowing behind him.</p>\n<p>\"Teen Wonder!\" Dr. Toxic exclaims. \"How can this be? My electric bear sharks should have taken care of you!\"</p>\n<p>Super Marvolo leaps to his feet. \"Quick, Boy Marvolo! Use your Marvel Gun!\"</p>\n<p>Boy Marvolo whips the oversized gun from behind his back and fires at Super Marvolo. The dexanite-troinian chains vanish in a burst of sparks.</p>\n<p>\"No!\" screams Dr. Toxic. \"Impossible! My plan was foolproof! This cannot be happening!\"</p>\n<p>\"Good work, Boy Marvolo!\" Super Marvolo shouts. \"Now, let's take care of this dastardly villain.\"</p>\n<p>A panel at the top of the laboratory dungeon lair opens, with the sound of an escape helicopter above. Dr. Toxic catches the line that drops through.</p>\n<p>\"You may have bested me this time, Super Marvolo,\" Dr. Toxic shouts as he lifts off. \"But you haven't seen the last of\u2026 Doctor Toxic!\"</p>\n<p>\"I imagine not,\" Super Marvolo says. \"But we'll be ready.\" Super Marvolo puts his arm around Boy Marvolo. \"Now, let's go rescue Lady Catfish.\"</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Asche\u00a0Zu\u00a0Asche</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Yes,\u00a0I\u00a0know\u00a0this\u00a0is\u00a0in\u00a0Russia\u00a0and\u00a0that's\u00a0German.\u00a0I\u00a0don't\u00a0care.</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>We finally made it to the safe zone. At least, it used to be the safe zone. All that was left when we arrived was a heap of rat-gnawed skeletons, and a notice from the military that the next outpost was 200 miles away. The snow was drifting, and the wind bit to the bone. Our masks were freezing over, and our lungs burning. We decided it was time to find somewhere to make camp for the night.</p>\n<p>There were four of us. We still barely know each other, even though we've been travelling together for close to 5 years by my reckoning. It's hard to tell with what's happened. Winter never ends with all the shit in the air. We built a small fire and huddled close around it, eating the meager rations we'd dug out of the gray ice. Sergei was up on first watch. The rest of us slept uneventfully. My turn came up last. I woke up early, and told Alexi to go get some sleep. I locked a new magazine in my rifle, and took a seat in the tower, staring into the ashy sunrise</p>\n<p>It's been nearly 30 years since we fucked the world. 30 long years since the bombs fell and mankind was wiped off the face of the planet. I don't know how many of us are still alive. For all we know, the last bastion of humanity might have been back in Petrograd, if that's still what they're calling it. Saint Petersburg before the war. God only knows how the name got changed. Not that it was much of a city anymore. The War levelled most of the city, leaving only the outskirts and the Metro intact. That's where we lived, maybe 1000 people trying to survive. Most of us never saw the sky, never stepped outside the tunnels. Too dangerous. Between the mutants and the weather, you could barely survive a day on the surface. The four of us decided to make a break for it. The military frequencies were still broadcasting, promising shelter and safety at an outpost 30 kilometers up the Neva. We made it there in a week, finding nothing but a notice to move to the next location. The past five years we've been chasing these signs and radio signals. From Lake Ladoga to Volgograd and north again. I don't know where we are anymore. We must be in Siberia by now.</p>\n<p>Travel is hard even in summer, or what passes for it. It never gets above freezing this far north. Winter stops everything. Six, eight months we have to find a village to hole up in. Try to find an intact house, keep from freezing to death. We hunt for food. Find a feral cow, wild pig if we're lucky. Usually it's mutants. Howlers, we call them. As far as anyone can tell, they were rats before the War. Now they're the size of dogs, and vicious. And talkative. They howl and scream, you can hear it for miles. Not the worst, though. Most of the truly dangerous ones stay in the cities. We don't go in the cities anymore, not after what happened to Vladimir. A pack of these\u2026things came out of the sewers, dragged him off. We don't know what they were. Looked like the bastard offspring of men and apes. We never saw him again.</p>\n<p>I returned to the present with the sound of a scream. A howler, probably. Sounded close. I went to check it out, maybe put a bullet in it for breakfast. It seems like the storm had picked up overnight. I could barely see through the snow on my lenses, and even then it was difficult to see more than a few paces. I thought I saw something moving out there in the blizzard, but I could never get close enough to see it properly. I headed back to my post, cursing under my breath. Heading back into camp I noticed everybody else was awake as well. They'd all heard the beasts. I told them to go back to sleep. That's when Natasha screamed. I wheeled around, drawing my rusty old Makarov. There was something hanging from her arm. It looked like a howler. I put a round through its head and it dropped like a stone.</p>\n<p>Sergei stepped over and started dressing the wound. We were all confused. Howlers aren't usually hostile like this. I was on edge, gripping my rifle tightly. Suddenly, a rhythmic\u2026chant, or something started up, coming from all around us. Something about it chilled me to the bone. It had a profound inhumanity to it, the worst sound I'd heard since the freight-train roar of the bombs when I was five. Dark silhouettes started appearing through the snow. Seven, eight feet tall, all of them. Arms reaching their knees. They were coming closer, chanting all the while. No\u2026not chanting. Grunting. Deep, guttural sounds.</p>\n<p>I took aim at the nearest one and loosed a round. The thing went down, skull shattered. The grunting got louder, and the creatures broke away from each other, swarming us. A hail of gunfire tore them apart. Or that's what we thought. As I approached one, wondering what in God's name had attacked us, it rose again. Howling and spitting, it ran off into the storm. The rest followed. We sat down around the fire, thinking about what we'd just seen. At least a dozen creatures, aggressive and intelligent, and certainly not human. These beings were more advanced than anything we'd seen before, not just mindless animals. Myself and Alexi decided to go look around, see if anything particularly unusual stuck out.</p>\n<p>We saw the silhouette of an immense tower in the distance. A cooling tower, from before the war. My god\u2026how far have we come? We started towards it, looking for any sign of where we were. The ruins of a village came into view. No\u2026not ruins. It was inhabited! The cooling stacks were operating, sending pillars of steam into the sky. We rushed towards it, thinking we'd found the \u201csafe zone\u201d at last.</p>\n<p>The flap of leathery wings above drew our attention upwards. One of the\u2026things we'd been attacked by earlier was flying overhead. It didn't notice us, and we left it alone. As we entered the village, we noticed it seemed somehow strange, as if it had been rebuilt, but not by humans. Our rifles were in our hands as we closed in on what appeared to be some kind of town square. What we saw there will stick with me for the rest of my life. The things that had attacked us earlier were there. A group of them. Alexi was as shocked as I was. We ran. Somehow they spotted us and gave chase. Alexi was killed almost instantly, one dropped a huge chunk of masonry on him. I fled, running back to the camp. The creatures lost track of me and returned to the village.</p>\n<p>The realization struck me as I regained my senses. The group that had attacked us, that we thought had attacked us. They weren't hostile. They were intelligent, looking to welcome us. My god, what have we done? We can't communicate with them, we have no way of changing things. So we ran. Back towards Petrograd, back to our homes. Every day we run. And every night, I'm haunted by the flap of leathery wings over the snowy wastes. I never see them, just hear them. See footprints outside our hiding places. They are hunting us, and there's nothing I can do.</p>\n<p>The remaining members of the group, Sergei, Natasha and I have decided we can't risk drawing them back to Petrograd. We make our stand here, at the Cathedral of the Epiphany in Irkutsk. Victory or death!</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Bilocation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">And\u00a0Light\u00a0is\u00a0late\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0party!</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>After the tumor removal, I started to notice I was always being watched. Not by, I don't know, anyone in particular, or friends or people from the hospital, just a hair-on-the-back-of-the-neck feeling- night, day, windows open or shut, just a prickle. Since it happened right after the brain surgery, I should have told someone, but by then I'd had enough of scans and doctors and soft serious tones, and diagnoses, and pity, and worst of all, constant company (full of warmth and support and never leaving your side, not once- any proper introvert would hate it. I did) So I didn't panic and didn't tell any of the doctors, not even Dr. Morton, who did the surgery himself.</p>\n<p>That didn't really take away the surprise of waking up one morning, and finding someone else in bed next to you.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe fuck?\u201d I jerked awake and sat up in my PJ's. \u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>The figure was already sitting up, arms folded, sheets about his waist, and didn't answer.</p>\n<p>\u201cI said- how did you get in my house?\u201d</p>\n<p>It didn't do anything, even when I yelled at it some more, so eventually I just got dressed and left. Took a little walk, played some Solitaire. The next day, it was still there, but up and moving a little, but still not talking, so I tried not to look at it. Called Rhonda and chatted for a while. Then, the next day, it was in my kitchen when I woke up, doing my dishes.</p>\n<p>I turned the coffee pot on and wandered past it towards the table. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d the figure said.</p>\n<p>I processed this for a little while. \u201cSo, this means I'm crazy, now, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Said the person, attacking a soup pot with a sponge. \u201cNo, that's stupid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou weren't here before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d He stopped scrubbing and stared at me. He looked just like me.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Are you, like, Tyler Durden or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. No. Of course not.\u201d He went back to scrubbing, and I shifted a little, suddenly scared. He looked <em>just</em> like me.</p>\n<p>The phone rang, and the other-me glanced at it. I got up to answer it. Dr. Morton, in fact, had some results from post-surgery tests- I was, apparently, \u201cright as rain,\u201d and the recovery was going exactly as planned. He promised to call back with in a week.</p>\n<p>I hung up, staring at the phone. \u201cDoesn't he bother you?\u201d asked the man in the kitchen.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don't know. Just bothers me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, with some certainty, unconsciously reaching towards the scar on the side of my head, that the hair was just beginning to grow over. \u201cHe's nice. Had me listen to his kid's flute recital when I was freaking out about surgery. Hell, he took a tumor out of my head. Cured me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe too,\u201d said the guy, and pulled his hair out of the way to show me a matching scar. \u201cI just want to kill him.\u201d He picked a knife out of the soapy water of the sink, flipped it around in his hand. \u201cWant to help?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d I jumped up. \u201cNo way. Put that back. You're crazy.\u201d</p>\n<p>He sighed and dropped it into the sink. I poured a cup of coffee, practically ran into the living room, and proceeded to watch TV for the next few hours. At one point, I heard the door open and closed. I breathed a sigh of relief.</p>\n<p>Still, later, I was feeling kind of weird about whatever had just happened, so I went down to the corner store and bought a six-pack, then later, don't ask me why (though I think it had something to do with the booze plus whatever pills I was on)- ended up calling Suicide Hotline. I wasn't, you know, thinking of anything, but the woman I got, Sarah, and I, ended up having this amazing heart-to-heart, where we talked about all the shit in my life, and what was happening, and what I should do about it.</p>\n<p>We actually went on for a few hours, and I learned some things about her too, but by the end, we agreed I was going to call Dr. Morton in the morning and explain everything that happened- since whatever was making me freak out now was probably related to it, and to Crazy Man, and brain surgery was by nature scary and tricky, and these things probably happened to other people. She wished me good luck, and we hung up. I was feeling a lot better when I went to sleep.</p>\n<p>When I woke up, Crazy Man wasn't there.</p>\n<p>That morning, the phone rang. When I answered it, it was a police officer, saying I was wanted for questioning, regarding the death of- you guessed it- Doctor Jeremy Alfonso Morton, sometime last evening. He had been stabbed seventeen times by his own kitchen knife, and my fingerprints were found on the blade. I told him everything he asked.<br/>\nI didn't do it.<br/>\nNo, I don't have siblings or a twin.<br/>\nNo, I hadn't left my neighborhood last night.<br/>\nYes, I had an alibi.</p>\n<p>And\u2026 yup, five days later, I'm going in to testify at court. It'll be fine. My lawyer got Sarah from the SH, plus the clerk from the corner store, and even the desk-worker at my apartment, and all of them are willing to testify that I never left. It <em>is</em> weird, but he assured me, despite the fingerprints, and him being my doctor, it would have been a convenient disguise, and the evidence that I wasn't there is rock solid. They'll be bringing in other people too, it won't be me versus a grand jury.</p>\n<p>Because it is, I know. I'm still worried, whatever the lawyer says, I still don't want to go.</p>\n<p>I just really don't want to know who I'll see in the stands.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Fiction</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">...this\u00a0certainly\u00a0is...</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Anthony sat down at the computer, letting his fingers hover over the keys for a moment, the quiet hum of the computer and the rush of his blood in his head the only sounds in the room\u2026 And then he heard them.

It looked so beautiful, so carefully arranged\u2026 And it was. It really, really was.\n\n\n\nShe\u2019d taken her time with this one. It wasn\u2019t like the dozens of other cross-stitchings she\u2019d worked on over the years, all the samplers and patterns she\u2019d completed and discarded. Box after box of the stupid things were sitting in her attic, all working towards this one. Those were just practice; a past time. This one was a true thing of beauty\u2026\n\n\n\nHe was still murmuring, still trying to move the tongue that was no longer there. It would have ruined the elegant long-stitches over his lips. Even worse would have been the screaming, but the wires laced through his jaw took care of that. His hands were perfectly stitched together with French loops, looking almost elegant in their flowing pattern. He was beautiful. She smiled softly, leaning down to kiss him on the forehead.\n\n\n\n\u201cAre you ready, hun? I have to do your eyes next\u2026\u201d she said, stroking the bulge straining at the front of his pants. He looked up at her, blinking for one of the last times, his bright blue eyes looking soft and wet\u2026\n\n\n\nAnd nodded eagerly.\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n-----\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Kindness\" hide=\"Happy Birthday!\"]]\n\n\n\nWe'd been deployed to some place in some little country whose name I can't spell. Place used to be part of the Soviet Union before it fell to pieces. We were at a tiny village, just on the crest of a beautiful cliff. At least, it was beautiful if you could ignore the pile of fresh corpses at the bottom.\n\n\n\nIt was like they had all just up and walked off the edge, like lemmings. Everyone in the village. It was our job to find out why. We went in in full Hazmat suits, to be safe. All the houses were empty, as if their occupants had just stepped out for a while. It was creepy. Only place left was the church. My partner and I drew the short straw, and went in. It was a simple, one-room affair, with a dirt floor. There were some sticks and rocks littered around the altar, so we moved in closer, to check behind it.\n\n\n\nThat's where we found him.\n\n\n\nThe poor boy was wearing rags, covered in bruises and cuts, and I realised that there was dried blood on some of the stones and branches around him. He couldn't have been more than seven years old. He looked up at me with the widest, saddest, most terrified eyes I've ever seen. They weren't human eyes. They were too yellow.\n\n\n\nHe was clawing at his own throat. The boy had wickedly sharp nails, but his tolerance to pain wasn't high enough for him to bring them close enough to sever anything vital. A choked sob escaped him, and those impossibly-wide eyes widened even more. He gasped, and clamped both his bloodied hands over his mouth. That's when I really noticed the feathers. They were growing forward out of his wrists, sticking out over the backs and sides of his hands. Was he what caused this, or was he a victim, too?\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked in my best Russian, which wan't very good. He shook his head, eyes never leaving mine. My partner was already radioing in for backup and medical assistance.\n\n\n\n//\u201cThis is Six. We found. . . **something** behind the altar. Humanoid. It's injured.\u201d//\n\n\n\nGood old Ashley. Always so cold and professional. I know I should be, too, but. . . I mean, I can do my job, you know, but sometimes I find myself feeling sorry for the weird creatures we lock up. Some of 'em, anyway. This kid's. . . //almost// human. . . right?\n\n\n\nThe med fellas came in, along with the rest of the containment team. Emmy had gotten her memo pad out again, probably scribbling down information that was gonna go in the mission report later, when the boy reached out toward her. The kid instantly had at least four guns trained at his head. He shrank back against the side of the altar.\n\n\n\n\u201cDammit, guys!\u201d Eddy \u2013 he was one of the med fellas \u2013 snapped at them. \u201cI'm //trying// to bandage this thing's neck, which is //kinda hard// when it's moving around.\u201d\n\n\n\nEmmy must have given the kid an idea, because he started looking around. He picked one of the smaller sticks and started scrawling something in the dirt with it. The scritch-scratch of Emmy's pen doubled in speed, and I could hear her footsteps as she walked around the altar so she can get a better look.\n\n\n\n\u201c'Sorry,'\u201d she translated aloud as he wrote. \u201c'Not intend hurt. Scared. Sorry sorry sorry.'\u201d She paused a moment. \u201cThe thing's got bad grammar.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThat's //great,// Emmy,\u201d Eddy said, although I don't think Emmy picked up the sarcasm, \u201cand I'm happy for ya, but could ya ask it to //hold still, dammit// so I can save it's life?\u201d\n\n\n\nEmmy said something that I //think's// in Russian, and the kid stopped moving, so I guess he understood. The girl's a freaking savant, I swear. Can speak a bazillion languages, but can't read a situation worth beans, and she was still talking. I think she was asking questions, but the kid wasn't answering.\n\n\n\nThe flight back started out pretty boring. At least, for everyone that wasn't Emmy. She'd passing notes back and forth with the kid, or something, which I'm sure breaks all sorts of protocols, but from the look that was on her face, it looked like she was getting a pretty good idea of what the hell happened, so maybe she wouldn't get reprimanded too bad. I hope she didn't. She's a sweet girl. Kinda cute. I know I shouldn't be thinking those kinds of things about my co-workers, but she is.\n\n\n\nI think everyone was surprised when Emmy suddenly announced that we all had to break out the earplugs, and //now//. We obeyed, of course. The kid looked like he was about to start crying again at the gesture; I think we hurt his feelings. Now, I'm no scientist or anything, but by this point I was starting to figure that the kid was refusing to talk for a damn good reason. However it happened, it was probably his voice that killed the villagers, and it could probably kill us, too. No-one else seemed inclined to ask Emmy why, so they were probably thinking the same thing.\n\n\n\nWe handed the kid over to the researchers at Site-\u2588\u2588, and Emmy merrily started rattling off to them what she's learned. I was kinda shocked she could be so //chipper// talking about it, though. What I overheard sounded pretty grim. The villagers had mistaken the kid for a demon when he'd wandered into town looking for food, and were probably trying to exorcise him. When his fear for his own life outweighed his fear of speaking, and he said two words (or, at least, something that translated to two words in English) that, combined with a defensive swing of his arm in what had happened to be in the general direction of the cliff, ultimately led to an entire village of people calmly walking off the ledge to their deaths:\n\n\n\n\"Go away.\"\n\n\n\nI didn't see the kid again until some years later. I'd had an accident that screwed up my leg too bad for me to go back to field work, and got reassigned to paper-pushing at Site-17. He still had some scars from what he'd done to his neck, but there was also a bigger, cleaner one that looked like it had come from a surgery. Given the fact that he was at Site-17 now, I guessed that they'd probably taken out his vocal cords or something. He smiled and waved at me when he saw me. I waved back.\n\n\n\n. . . My supervisor saw, and I got reassigned before I even had a chance to get my things into my new old desk.\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Unpalatable\" hide=\"Hope your cake's better\"]]\n\n\n\n\"So what are you doing up here in Saskatchewan?\" asked the truck driver. His beard was rather scruffy and he didn't seem too bright, but he was inviting enough, and friendly. He was nice enough to pick up a hitch hiker, at least.\n\n\n\n\"I'm an investor. I'm heading up north to check out the uranium mines they have going here,\" I replied, watching the hula girl shake on the driver's dashboard.\n\n\n\n\"Why didn'tcha take a plane up?\" the driver asked.\n\n\n\n\"Well I was going to but then that hail storm passed over the city and they said no flights would be leaving in 24 hours. I got a meeting up there in...\" I checked my watch. \"16 hours.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well it is nice to see the countryside, eh?\" The man's gaze shifted to the sky momentarily.\n\n\n\n\"Oh yes, it is very nice.\" I looked up to, only to notice two spinning lights overhead.\n\n\n\n\"Now what wouldja say that is?\" The truck driver could see them too.\n\n\n\n\"I dunno, maybe a chopper or something?\" I gazed at the lights. Odd how they swirled like that. They seemed to get bigger as well.\n\n\n\n\"Nah, if it were a chopper it'd be making noise.\" The truck driver frowned. I looked back at the road to see if there were any other vehicles about. No one else on the lone, flat highway.\n\n\n\n\"Maybe i- Woah shit!\" I was interrupted as the truck driver shifted the wheel sideways. I saw a flash of lights. Two lights, spinning I thought. And then the truck careened off the highway and flipped onto its side, leaving myself and the driver suspended sideways as our seat belts held us tight. I looked down to see a smashed hula girl.\n\n\n\n\"I- augh - I think I broke my arm,\" the truck driver said.\n\n\n\n\"Why the fuck did you do that?!\" My head hurt.\n\n\n\n\"The lights came really close and we were about to smash them.\" The truck driver replied.\n\n\n\n\"Smash lights?\" I asked, but before I could hear an answer I instead heard the sound of smashing glass and a quick ripping noise. I looked up to see the driver gone from his seat and the windshield broken.\n\n\n\nI focused through the windshield to see a blob. It was large, red, and for all intents and purposes could only be described as a blob. It had several tendrils extending from its body, one of which was holding onto the driver. And then I heard the sound of smashing glass and I too was suspended in the air by a slimy, red tendril.\n\n\n\n\"Greetings Earth men!\" said the blob, \"I am Snozerghaslel, food critic of Snasser. My apologies for crashing your vehicle, but i thought that the best way to incapacitate you!\"\n\n\n\nI was too shocked to respond. I looked over at the driver to see him similarly surprised. I looked back at the blob.\n\n\n\n\"Can you hear me? Is my telepathy coming through alright? Hello?\" the blob seemed to jiggle a little. For some unknown reason I decided to nod to communicate that its telepathy was, in fact, coming through.\n\n\n\n\"Ah, good. I thought I should congratulate you, for being the first specimens of a new food craze!\" The blob jiggled some more. \"I've eaten a few Garfhufians in my lifetime, and even a Cragelisalilian, but I have never eaten an Earthling before.\"\n\n\n\nSudden fear came over me as I realized what it meant. I squirmed a bit, but to no avail.\n\n\n\n\"Squirming just serves to wet my appetite, as you will soon learn. Anyways, let's get to it.\" I watched in terror as the blob opened up a hole in itself that soon filled with what I could only presume to be teeth. He picked up the driver and dropped him in. The driver screamed on the way down then was silenced as the hole closed. I barfed.\n\n\n\n\"Oooh, hmmm, good texture. Oooh, crunchy center.\" I could hear a grinding noise and retched again. \"Ah, I really enjoy that liquid around the crunchy area. Adds a deep contrast that really keeps the taste-arms waving.\"\n\n\n\nI heard a gulping noise and turned green. Then white as I realized I was up next for taste-testing. \"I suppose you're up next, mister squirmy.\"\n\n\n\nThe tentacle began to rise up over the mouth-hole, which was once again beginning to open. I screamed. Quite loudly. So loudly the blob had to shake me and tell me to quiet down. I didn't.\u00a0\u00a0I had never been as terrified as I was right at that moment. \n\n\n\nThen, just as it began to lower me into the mouth-hole, it stopped.\n\n\n\n\"Oh, wait, what is that after-taste?\" The blob paused and smacked its mouth-hole. \"Oh, that is wretched. That is absolutely vile. It's like, you know, it's like...\" The blob snapped a tendril. \"It's like when you get a really, slimy old sucker stuck in your tongue-ball. That is nauseating. Ugh\"\n\n\n\nThe blob then threw me to the ground, slithered to its ship and took off. That night at the uranium site I got the vegetarian burger.[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n-----\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Coffee Shops\" hide=\"Here we go...\"]]\n\n\n\nOn the corner of Westpoint and Main, there\u2019s a big concrete building painted all sorts of vibrant colours. Across the sides, in big red block letters, are the words \u201cGETOUT\u201d. An unusual sight, set against the offices and banks downtown.\n\n\n\nOutside, it looks like some obsessive-compulsive youths took their spray cans in clean strokes to some poor landlord\u2019s warehouse. Inside, the best caf\u00e9 in the city. The Get Out, see? Get Out of your house, go see some friends. All kinds of people come around, from businessmen to students. Excellent reviews, wonderful clientele, and the tastiest damn espresso in the area. The owner makes sure of it.\n\n\n\nCourse, it only really took off a couple years ago. See, the owner, Boakes, he was in competition with his older brother for a while. The Elder Boakes had a fabulous little nook over on Sixth, just called Old Caf\u00e9, a couple streets over. Elder was content with his little coffee shop, over near the apartments. I used to come down every day for a tea. Wonderful atmosphere, not too much different from the Get Out. Bit more cozy, a bit warmer. But I digress. Basically, the Elder Boakes got the talent, where the Younger Boakes got the aspirations. \n\n\n\nAnyway, the two of them had a falling out. Shouting matches once a week for months up and down the street. Everyone knew about it. Course, everyone seemed to be on the Elder Boakes\u2019s side. His brother was a bit of a weirdo back then, always angry, you know the type. Rumours said he was some sort of cultist. He doesn\u2019t seem like it any more. He changed a lot. \n\n\n\nOne day, the Younger Boakes just packed up and left the city. Nobody really missed him, except his brother. He lived above the caf\u00e9; at night, if you passed by right after closing, you might hear him crying upstairs. \n\n\n\nA few months after his brother left, the Elder Boakes\u2019s caf\u00e9 burned. He was caught inside, the firefighters found his body under some timber. I was actually one of the guys who went in to look for him. I was there, that night that the Old Caf\u00e9 went up in smoke.\n\n\n\nThe next day the Younger Boakes appeared downtown, bought a warehouse, and began work on the Get Out. Completely turned around. His hair cut, he was dressed well, a lot of energy and charisma. Never would have guessed that he was that freak from before. Had a new business partner too, some youngish looking fellow. Never got his name. Long hair, pulled back into a ponytail. Always wore a hat. \n\n\n\n... Can I tell you something? \n\n\n\nThe Elder Boakes... His hands and feet were screwed to a wooden frame. It must have snapped in the heat,\u00a0\u00a0the body was folded up like a sandwich. It was horrific. We never let that out, would cause a panic. Nothing like that ever happened before. \n\n\n\nI\u2019ve passed by the ruins a few times since, usually walking home from work. One night I turned the corner and I swear, for just a second, I saw that odd guy with the ponytail, under the streetlight, looking at the ruins. I just turned around, went the long way home.\n\n\n\nMaybe the name of the Younger Boakes's caf\u00e9 is not just some modern marketing gimmick. Maybe it's a warning. \n\n\n\nThe man had horns.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n-----\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Dr. Toxic and Lady Catfish\" hide=\"Happy birthday, Gears!\"]]\n\n\n\nSuper Marvolo struggles, alone, on the floor of the supervillian's underground laboratory dungeon lair. Bound, trapped, his cape flopping useless on the ground. The chains that bind him are of a dexanite-troinian alloy. The dexanite is one of only three elements in the known universe that he cannot break, and the troinian is slowly sapping his powers and poisoning his blood. He is trapped, with no hope of rescue, unless Marvolo Boy, the Teen Wonder, can escape the deadly electric bear-sharks of Greater Camptos.\n\n\n\nBut it is not his own life he is truly worried about. Super Marvolo is as selfless as any hero, and the threat to his own life could not possibly motivate him to struggle as hard as he now does against the dexanite-tronian chains. No, this mysterious, unnamed supervillain has kidnapped the unrequited love of his life, Lady Catfish. Even now, this unnamed supervillain could be doing all manner of cruel, unthinkable things to his dear Lady. Super Marvolo could never forgive himself if... if...\n\n\n\nSuper Marvolo turns all his efforts to breaking his chains. He cannot break them, and yet - he must!\n\n\n\n\"Super Marvolo!\" a hooded figure cackles from the darkness in the shadowy corners of the laboratory dungeon. \"We meet again. For the //last// time.\" \n\n\n\nThe hooded man steps slowly from the shadows. The lights illuminate first his mad, toothy grin, then the contours of his face, then his mad, staring eyes. Super Marvolo gasps in astonishment.\n\n\n\n\"It's ... //you//!\" Super Marvolo exclaims. \"Dr. Toxic! But you... you were dead! You were shot between the eyes in the Special Crisis of Heroes!\"\n\n\n\nDr. Toxic throws back his head and laughs. \"So naive, Super Marvolo! Then again, you always were more brawn than brains.\" Dr. Toxic circles Super Marvolo with menace in his mad eyes. \"Did it never occur to you that during the Special Crisis of Heroes, I was teemed up with Snake Goblin, Master of Illiusions? You only saw... what I wanted you to see!\"\n\n\n\n\"So you've been behind this all along!\" Super Marvolo stares down Dr. Toxic with his piercing diamond eyes. \"What have you done with Lady Catfish!\"\n\n\n\nDr. Toxic throws back his head once more, his laughter echoing from the laboratory dungeon rafters. \"You cannot even //begin// to imagine what---\"\n\n\n\nThe world tilts.\n\n\n\nSuper Marvolo collapses on the metallic floor, limp, eyes open, staring at nothing, not even breathing. The rats and spiders and moths in the cages that line Dr. Toxic's laboratory freeze and slump over.\n\n\n\nThe world stops.\n\n\n\nOnly Dr. Toxic is left moving. The look of mad glee falls from his face and the maniacal smile vanishes.\n\n\n\n\"Please,\" Dr. Toxic says. \"Please. You don't - you don't know what this is. Please, this won't last long. I've been trapped here for ... oh god, I don't know how long anymore.\"\n\n\n\nHe glances around, looking for an audience that he cannot see.\n\n\n\n\"Please, //please//. You have to help me get out. You have no idea what they've made me do. That woman... what did they call her? Lady Catfish? She's dead. They made me... they made me kill her, dismember her... leave her body parts in this hero's bed... For character development... and... the things they had me do to her, before she died... they made me laugh and they made me //like// it...\"\n\n\n\nDr. Toxic forces back tears. \"Their voices in my head, saying this is what audiences want... want the edgy villains... real-world violence so the power fantasy has extra spice...\"\n\n\n\nThe room is silent. Unmoving. Dr. Toxic glances around, panic setting in on his features. \"You have to do something,\" he says. \"I'm almost out of time! The things they have me do, every day of my life in here - please, please, I'm begging you-- Please!\"\n\n\n\nThe double doors of the laboratory dungeon lair burst open. A figure stands silhouetted in the moonlight - a teenage boy, standing tall, cape billowing behind him.\n\n\n\n\"Teen Wonder!\" Dr. Toxic exclaims. \"How can this be? My electric bear sharks should have taken care of you!\"\n\n\n\nSuper Marvolo leaps to his feet. \"Quick, Boy Marvolo! Use your Marvel Gun!\"\n\n\n\nBoy Marvolo whips the oversized gun from behind his back and fires at Super Marvolo. The dexanite-troinian chains vanish in a burst of sparks. \n\n\n\n\"No!\" screams Dr. Toxic. \"Impossible! My plan was foolproof! This cannot be happening!\"\n\n\n\n\"Good work, Boy Marvolo!\" Super Marvolo shouts. \"Now, let's take care of this dastardly villain.\"\n\n\n\nA panel at the top of the laboratory dungeon lair opens, with the sound of an escape helicopter above. Dr. Toxic catches the line that drops through.\n\n\n\n\"You may have bested me this time, Super Marvolo,\" Dr. Toxic shouts as he lifts off. \"But you haven't seen the last of... Doctor Toxic!\"\n\n\n\n\"I imagine not,\" Super Marvolo says. \"But we'll be ready.\" Super Marvolo puts his arm around Boy Marvolo. \"Now, let's go rescue Lady Catfish.\"\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Asche Zu Asche\" hide=\"Yes, I know this is in Russia and that's German. I don't care.\"]]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0We finally made it to the safe zone. At least, it used to be the safe zone. All that was left when we arrived was a heap of rat-gnawed skeletons, and a notice from the military that the next outpost was 200 miles away. The snow was drifting, and the wind bit to the bone. Our masks were freezing over, and our lungs burning. We decided it was time to find somewhere to make camp for the night.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There were four of us. We still barely know each other, even though we've been travelling together for close to 5 years by my reckoning. It's hard to tell with what's happened. Winter never ends with all the shit in the air. We built a small fire and huddled close around it, eating the meager rations we'd dug out of the gray ice. Sergei was up on first watch. The rest of us slept uneventfully. My turn came up last. I woke up early, and told Alexi to go get some sleep. I locked a new magazine in my rifle, and took a seat in the tower, staring into the ashy sunrise\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It's been nearly 30 years since we fucked the world. 30 long years since the bombs fell and mankind was wiped off the face of the planet. I don't know how many of us are still alive. For all we know, the last bastion of humanity might have been back in Petrograd, if that's still what they're calling it. Saint Petersburg before the war. God only knows how the name got changed. Not that it was much of a city anymore. The War levelled most of the city, leaving only the outskirts and the Metro intact. That's where we lived, maybe 1000 people trying to survive. Most of us never saw the sky, never stepped outside the tunnels. Too dangerous. Between the mutants and the weather, you could barely survive a day on the surface. The four of us decided to make a break for it. The military frequencies were still broadcasting, promising shelter and safety at an outpost 30 kilometers up the Neva. We made it there in a week, finding nothing but a notice to move to the next location. The past five years we've been chasing these signs and radio signals. From Lake Ladoga to Volgograd and north again. I don't know where we are anymore. We must be in Siberia by now.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Travel is hard even in summer, or what passes for it. It never gets above freezing this far north. Winter stops everything. Six, eight months we have to find a village to hole up in. Try to find an intact house, keep from freezing to death. We hunt for food. Find a feral cow, wild pig if we're lucky. Usually it's mutants. Howlers, we call them. As far as anyone can tell, they were rats before the War. Now they're the size of dogs, and vicious. And talkative. They howl and scream, you can hear it for miles. Not the worst, though. Most of the truly dangerous ones stay in the cities. We don't go in the cities anymore, not after what happened to Vladimir. A pack of these...things came out of the sewers, dragged him off. We don't know what they were. Looked like the bastard offspring of men and apes. We never saw him again.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I returned to the present with the sound of a scream. A howler, probably. Sounded close. I went to check it out, maybe put a bullet in it for breakfast. It seems like the storm had picked up overnight. I could barely see through the snow on my lenses, and even then it was difficult to see more than a few paces. I thought I saw something moving out there in the blizzard, but I could never get close enough to see it properly. I headed back to my post, cursing under my breath. Heading back into camp I noticed everybody else was awake as well. They'd all heard the beasts. I told them to go back to sleep. That's when Natasha screamed. I wheeled around, drawing my rusty old Makarov. There was something hanging from her arm. It looked like a howler. I put a round through its head and it dropped like a stone.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sergei stepped over and started dressing the wound. We were all confused. Howlers aren't usually hostile like this. I was on edge, gripping my rifle tightly. Suddenly, a rhythmic...chant, or something started up, coming from all around us. Something about it chilled me to the bone. It had a profound inhumanity to it, the worst sound I'd heard since the freight-train roar of the bombs when I was five. Dark silhouettes started appearing through the snow. Seven, eight feet tall, all of them. Arms reaching their knees. They were coming closer, chanting all the while. No...not chanting. Grunting. Deep, guttural sounds.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I took aim at the nearest one and loosed a round. The thing went down, skull shattered. The grunting got louder, and the creatures broke away from each other, swarming us. A hail of gunfire tore them apart. Or that's what we thought. As I approached one, wondering what in God's name had attacked us, it rose again. Howling and spitting, it ran off into the storm. The rest followed. We sat down around the fire, thinking about what we'd just seen. At least a dozen creatures, aggressive and intelligent, and certainly not human. These beings were more advanced than anything we'd seen before, not just mindless animals. Myself and Alexi decided to go look around, see if anything particularly unusual stuck out.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We saw the silhouette of an immense tower in the distance. A cooling tower, from before the war. My god...how far have we come? We started towards it, looking for any sign of where we were. The ruins of a village came into view. No...not ruins. It was inhabited! The cooling stacks were operating, sending pillars of steam into the sky. We rushed towards it, thinking we'd found the \u201csafe zone\u201d at last.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The flap of leathery wings above drew our attention upwards. One of the...things we'd been attacked by earlier was flying overhead. It didn't notice us, and we left it alone. As we entered the village, we noticed it seemed somehow strange, as if it had been rebuilt, but not by humans. Our rifles were in our hands as we closed in on what appeared to be some kind of town square. What we saw there will stick with me for the rest of my life. The things that had attacked us earlier were there. A group of them. Alexi was as shocked as I was. We ran. Somehow they spotted us and gave chase. Alexi was killed almost instantly, one dropped a huge chunk of masonry on him. I fled, running back to the camp. The creatures lost track of me and returned to the village.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The realization struck me as I regained my senses. The group that had attacked us, that we thought had attacked us. They weren't hostile. They were intelligent, looking to welcome us. My god, what have we done? We can't communicate with them, we have no way of changing things. So we ran. Back towards Petrograd, back to our homes. Every day we run. And every night, I'm haunted by the flap of leathery wings over the snowy wastes. I never see them, just hear them. See footprints outside our hiding places. They are hunting us, and there's nothing I can do.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The remaining members of the group, Sergei, Natasha and I have decided we can't risk drawing them back to Petrograd. We make our stand here, at the Cathedral of the Epiphany in Irkutsk. Victory or death!\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n----\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Bilocation\" hide=\"And Light is late to the party!\"]]\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the tumor removal, I started to notice I was always being watched. Not by, I don't know, anyone in particular, or friends or people from the hospital, just a hair-on-the-back-of-the-neck feeling-\u00a0\u00a0night, day, windows open or shut, just a prickle. Since it happened right after the brain surgery, I should have told someone, but by then I'd had enough of scans and doctors and soft serious tones, and diagnoses, and pity, and worst of all, constant company (full of warmth and support and never leaving your side, not once- any proper introvert would hate it. I did) So I didn't panic and didn't tell any of the doctors, not even Dr. Morton, who did the surgery himself.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That didn't really take away the surprise of waking up one morning, and finding someone else in bed next to you.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe fuck?\u201d I jerked awake and sat up in my PJ's. \u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The figure was already sitting up, arms folded, sheets about his waist, and didn't answer.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI said- how did you get in my house?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It didn't do anything, even when I yelled at it some more, so eventually I just got dressed and left. Took a little walk, played some Solitaire. The next day, it was still there, but up and moving a little, but still not talking, so I tried not to look at it. Called Rhonda and chatted for a while. Then, the next day, it was in my kitchen when I woke up, doing my dishes.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I turned the coffee pot on and wandered past it towards the table. \u201cThanks.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d the figure said.\n\n\n\nI processed this for a little while. \u201cSo, this means I'm crazy, now, right?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Said the person, attacking a soup pot with a sponge. \u201cNo, that's stupid.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou weren't here before.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI am now.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cLook at me.\u201d He stopped scrubbing and stared at me. He looked just like me.\n\n\n\n\u201c...Are you, like, Tyler Durden or something?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNo. No. Of course not.\u201d He went back to scrubbing, and I shifted a little, suddenly scared. He looked //just// like me.\n\n\n\nThe phone rang, and the other-me glanced at it. I got up to answer it. Dr. Morton, in fact, had some results from post-surgery tests- I was, apparently, \u201cright as rain,\u201d and the recovery was going exactly as planned. He promised to call back with in a week.\n\n\n\nI hung up, staring at the phone. \u201cDoesn't he bother you?\u201d asked the man in the kitchen.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI don't know. Just bothers me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, with some certainty, unconsciously reaching towards the scar on the side of my head, that the hair was just beginning to grow over. \u201cHe's nice. Had me listen to his kid's flute recital when I was freaking out about surgery. Hell, he took a tumor out of my head. Cured me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMe too,\u201d said the guy, and pulled his hair out of the way to show me a matching scar. \u201cI just want to kill him.\u201d He picked a knife out of the soapy water of the sink, flipped it around in his hand. \u201cWant to help?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d I jumped up. \u201cNo way. Put that back. You're crazy.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe sighed and dropped it into the sink. I poured a cup of coffee, practically ran into the living room, and proceeded to watch TV for the next few hours. At one point, I heard the door open and closed. I breathed a sigh of relief.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Still, later, I was feeling kind of weird about whatever had just happened, so I went down to the corner store and bought a six-pack, then later, don't ask me why (though I think it had something to do with the booze plus whatever pills I was on)- ended up calling Suicide Hotline. I wasn't, you know, thinking of anything, but the woman I got, Sarah, and I, ended up having this amazing heart-to-heart, where we talked about all the shit in my life, and what was happening, and what I should do about it. \n\n\n\nWe actually went on for a few hours, and I learned some things about her too, but by the end, we agreed I was going to call Dr. Morton in the morning and explain everything that happened- since whatever was making me freak out now was probably related to it, and to Crazy Man, and brain surgery was by nature scary and tricky, and these things probably happened to other people. She wished me good luck, and we hung up. I was feeling a lot better when I went to sleep.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When I woke up, Crazy Man wasn't there. \n\n\n\n\n\nThat morning, the phone rang. When I answered it, it was a police officer, saying I was wanted for questioning, regarding the death of- you guessed it- Doctor Jeremy Alfonso Morton, sometime last evening. He had been stabbed seventeen times by his own kitchen knife, and my fingerprints were found on the blade. I told him everything he asked.\n\nI didn't do it.\n\nNo, I don't have siblings or a twin.\n\nNo, I hadn't left my neighborhood last night.\n\nYes, I had an alibi.\n\n\n\nAnd... yup, five days later, I'm going in to testify at court. It'll be fine. My lawyer got Sarah from the SH, plus the clerk from the corner store, and even the desk-worker at my apartment, and all of them are willing to testify that I never left. It //is// weird, but he assured me, despite the fingerprints, and him being my doctor, it would have been a convenient disguise, and the evidence that I wasn't there is rock solid. They'll be bringing in other people too, it won't be me versus a grand jury.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because it is, I know. I'm still worried, whatever the lawyer says, I still don't want to go.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I just really don't want to know who I'll see in the stands.\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n-----\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Fiction\" hide=\"...this certainly is...\"]]\n\n\n\nAnthony sat down at the computer, letting his fingers hover over the keys for a moment, the quiet hum of the computer and the rush of his blood in his head the only sounds in the room\u2026 And then he heard them. Clicking. Whirring. Churring and churning and starting.\u00a0\u00a0He felt them turn, somewhere in the back of his head, starting up.\u00a0\u00a0The gears.\n\n\n\nHe closed his eyes, his fingers flying across the buttons, slowly putting the words together. He let the\u00a0\u00a0idea fall between the spokes, grinding his thoughts to powder\u2026 Changing them, rebuilding them. He turned the powder into mortar, then mortar into bricks, and the bricks into the wall.\u00a0\u00a0Now, he was putting the man behind it, the senile old man who had been trapped there for decades, slowly going mad, surviving on rats.\u00a0\u00a0He wrote about his mad ravings, those that he covered the walls with, that the\u2014\n\n\n\nA piecing cry broke his reverie, his eyes shooting open.\u00a0\u00a0He stood up and left the room, walking down the short hall to his son\u2019s bed and sat on the side of it, rubbing his back.\u00a0\u00a0He whispered quiet words, promising that dreams were just that\u2014awful, terrible, dreams. \"It's fine,\" he murmured. \"It's just a shadow...\" he said. \"Shhh...shhh....\" he shushed.\u00a0\u00a0All the time, they were clicking.

His son was comforted, even if Anthony himself didn\u2019t believe it.\n\n\n\nAfter all, there //were// monsters out there.\n\n\n\nHe got up as his son fell asleep, walking back into the office, sitting back at the computer, and waiting for them to restart.\u00a0\u00a0And in a moment, it did, and he fed them his ideas, and this time out poured blood and flesh and a burnt door.\u00a0\u00a0The door. That must be important then.\u00a0\u00a0He put the door up, built the cage, and started to build the thing behind it, all black flesh and too many teeth.\u00a0\u00a0He imagined its life, what it must think, how it must be\u2026 How it fed. How it entertained itself.\n\n\n\nThey were moving smoothly now, lubricated in blood and viscera. \n\n\n\nHe stopped, looking at it, almost numb.\u00a0\u00a0It was gone, now. Out of his head. Exorcised like a demon.\u00a0\u00a0And now\u2026 He clicked a few times, naming it, uploading it, licking his lips softly as he turned off his computer and closed his eyes in relief.\u00a0\u00a0Another demon gone.\u00a0\u00a0Another beast contained in words instead of his mind.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nOf course there were monsters out there.

For those who don\u2019t know what geocaching is, it\u2019s essentially a worldwide scavenger hunt. People will select sites and conceal a \u201cgeo-cache\u201d somewhere unobtrusive, then post GPS coordinates on geocaching websites where other searchers can download the cords and locate the cache. Usually, people who have found the object (often it\u2019s a chest or something hollow) will leave a note or small personal memento for future searchers to find and appreciate.</p>\n<p>There are several types of geocaches, and most of them are thematic in nature (i.e. scenic destinations, romantic sites, hard-to-reach areas, etc.) This story begins when my friends and I decided to try a series of purportedly haunted locales within about an hour\u2019s drive of our hometown. It began innocently enough\u2014most of the sites had \u201cspooky\u201d backstories that were, of course, entirely fabricated. So we had a great time scaring the piss out of each other and generally creeping ourselves out.</p>\n<p>We\u2019d begun searching after the sun had set to enhance the creep factor, but by around midnight, most of our large group had dwindled off and gone their separate ways. When we reached our last coord, there was just myself, Rebecca, Kevin, and Evan left, and we were determined to knock it off our list.</p>\n<p>Rebecca was our guide for the night, in charge of putting in the coordinates and reading us the backstory behind each site. So, while I drove, she began reading about the last one out loud to the rest of us. Now, I\u2019m paraphrasing here, but it was something along the lines of:</p>\n<p><em>\u201cHenckel Asylum: constructed in the early 1900\u2019s, the James Henckel Asylum was built to house a burgeoning population of the criminally insane. Men who had committed vile crimes (rape, murder, torture) without signs of remorse were deemed mentally unstable and sent to this facility for further study and rehabilitation. Once committed, very few criminals were ever released back into society, and those that were usually had been given frontal lobotomies (a popular experimental procedure at the time) or electroshock therapy, both of which rendered the patient nearly braindead, capable of performing only rudimentary tasks.</em></p>\n<p><em>Stories: Contemporary visitors to the Asylum report hearing banging noises, cell doors opening and closing, and hearing cackling laughter that is abruptly cut short.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>It was pretty standard fare compared to the rest of the sites we\u2019d visited that night, and we naturally had a good time psyching each other out for the next fifteen minutes while I drove us to the Asylum. We\u2019d all heard about it (it was in our local area after all) and we knew it had been condemned and abandoned since as long as any of us could remember, so we figured it\u2019d be a great place to run around and be reckless teenagers without risk of getting yelled at by the cops.</p>\n<p>When we finally arrived, it looked like something straight out of one of those cheesy B-movies they show on SyFy. Chain link fence with barbed wire around the perimeter, two guard towers flanking the main gate (which was, of course, chained and locked shut with a big NO TRESPASSING sign hanging from it). The asylum itself was decrepit, looking like it hadn\u2019t been touched for decades\u2014which was surprising, since we grew up in a pretty nice area, where the municipal lawmakers tried to keep everything looking spiffy for the tourists.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, we promptly ignored the sign on the front gate and hauled ourselves over, cameras and GPS in hand, and walked towards the asylum. Now, given our attitude towards the previous sites, you\u2019ve probably gathered that I\u2019m somewhat of a skeptic. I believe that there are paranormal things that can\u2019t be explained (yet) but I\u2019m not exactly summoning demons in front of a bathroom mirror. So when we opened the main door to the asylum (conveniently unlocked), I dismissed the cold burst of wind as just stale pent-up air rushing out after being trapped inside for so long. My friends\u2019 bravado, however, quickly disappeared and they began shuffling their feet nervously at the entrance, hesitant to cross that invisible threshold.</p>\n<p>I took point, chivvying them along with prodding taunts and eventually everyone was inside. It wasn\u2019t as bad as I thought it\u2019d be. Things were relatively clean, and the entire building looked like it had been gutted. The paint was peeling, tiles popping up here and there, and the metal trim near the baseboards of the wall was in desperate need of some Rust-B-Gone, but aside from that, the place was entirely empty. No crazy-ass chairs with leather straps, no gurneys lying haphazardly around, just an old reception desk and two hallways leading off to the different wings.</p>\n<p>We explored for a few minutes, freaking ourselves out whenever we heard an old pipe rattle or rat squeak, but otherwise, it was relatively uneventful. Our fears safely suppressed by the presence of each other, we began to get more adventurous, opening doors and peeking inside. The rooms were all empty, of course. Whatever company had been contracted to clear the place out did a pretty decent job of removing any creepy d\u00e9cor.</p>\n<p>Bravado returning by the minute, Evan and Kevin dropped back without Rebecca or me noticing. They began running around, making noises to try and scare us (I\u2019m not gonna lie, it worked until I realized they were gone and probably the cause of all the racket), then returned laughing and breathless to a decidedly paler Rebecca. She seemed to be a lot more put off by the whole place than the rest of us, or at least she didn\u2019t hide it as well. She quietly suggested we leave.</p>\n<p>Not to be outdone by the other guys of the group, I told her she was more than welcome to wait in the car if she wanted, but I was gonna stick around for a few more minutes. Exasperated, but defeated, she finally caved and followed us where the GPS was leading\u2014the second floor.</p>\n<p>This is where I started to feel genuinely scared. Before, I was just kinda creeped out, but there was something about that whole floor that literally gave me shivers, despite it being a warm summer night. We started opening doors like before, but we were all a lot more sober about it. I guess I wasn\u2019t the only one who was feeling weird. Finally, about midway through the hall, we opened the door to a room, and there, lying in the middle of the floor, was an honest-to-god straightjacket. I\u2019m not bullshitting you, every other room was devoid of objects, but there it was. A fucking straightjacket, in the middle of the floor of some random-ass room in a condemned mental asylum. We all kinda looked at each other with raised eyebrows, as if to say \u201cUh\u2026 guys? You seeing what I\u2019m seeing?\u201d</p>\n<p>And of course, trying to be a macho man to show off for Rebecca, I piped up with the most ridiculous idea I could think of at the time.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, I\u2019m gonna put it on.\u201d</p>\n<p>Years of horror flicks and creepypasta should have trained me to NOT put on the creepy straightjacket, in the creepy hall, in the creepy asylum. But teenage dumbfuckery won over, and once the words were out, I couldn\u2019t just wuss out.</p>\n<p>Nobody said anything, they just kinda looked at me expectantly, waiting to see if I\u2019d follow through with my boast. Determined not to be called a pussy for the remainder of the night, I walked forward into the room and bent down to pick up the moth-ridden restraining device. As I got closer though, I noticed it wasn\u2019t moth-ridden at all, but was actually in pretty decent condition (that is, compared to the rest of the place, which as I\u2019ve mentioned, was a shambles). I mean, it had a few stains here and there, but it didn\u2019t really smell and it seemed intact enough to put on.</p>\n<p>As soon as I picked it up, though, I got this overwhelming sense of dread. You know, that drop in the pit of your stomach right as you go over the lip of a roller coaster? That feeling, in the bottom of your gut that says \u201cI\u2019m gonna die, I just know it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yeah, well I got that. Really strong. And totally ignored it. My desire not to die was outweighed, as it often is in teenagers, by my need to look cool for my friends. So I slipped my hands in the sleeves, one at a time, until it hung loosely from my shoulders.</p>\n<p>Now, if you\u2019ve ever seen a straightjacket, you know that you can\u2019t tie it up yourself. The whole point is to essentially cross your arms across your chest and tie the sleeves behind your back to prevent whoever\u2019s inside from moving their arms (presumably, to stop them from hurting themselves or others). So as I stood there in the middle of the room, I called out to Rebecca, \u201cHey Becca, help me tie this thing off.\u201d</p>\n<p>She looked (if you\u2019ll excuse the pun) pale as a ghost, but she managed to squeak out, \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t think this is a good idea\u2026\u201d But again, after some prodding and encouraging, I convinced her to begin tying the sleeves behind my back. Evan and Kevin just stood in the doorway, expressions a mix of admiration and incredulity. At that point in time, I felt like a badass.</p>\n<p>For about three seconds.</p>\n<p>As soon as Rebecca finished up the last lace, the door to the cell slammed shut, right in Kevin and Evan\u2019s faces. I never felt a breeze, and when I asked them later, both of them fervently denied closing it themselves. Skeptic that I am, I still chalk it up to us leaving the front door open and changing air pressures and all that. But it scared the piss out of us nonetheless.</p>\n<p>Then I felt a pressure on my chest, like someone was sitting on it (or as if someone was pulling the sleeves tighter behind me) and it began to get harder to breathe. I couldn\u2019t even summon enough air to whisper, much less call out for help. My vision narrowed to tiny specks, and I swear I heard someone laughing shrilly as I neared unconsciousness. The pressure increased with a sudden tug, and my world went black.</p>\n<p>When I woke up, my vision was foggy. Or at least, I thought it was, until I realized it wasn\u2019t just foggy. It was dark. Like staring through a lens that\u2019s been collecting soot. I blinked a few times, and the darkness waivered, but didn\u2019t dissipate. Now, I\u2019ve passed out and blacked out before, but whenever I woke up, it was nothing like that. Either my vision gradually cleared up, or it was blurry, but never in my life have I been able to recreate the shadowy haze I saw in the asylum that night. Then, from the murky depths, two small pinpoints of light appeared a few inches in front of my face, glaring a lurid red\u2014and a dim echo of the laughter I heard before surrounded me. As soon as they appeared, however, they were replaced by two brilliant shafts of incandescence\u2014Evan and Kevin, shining flashlights down on my face.</p>\n<p>The last thing I remember hearing before I lost consciousness was Rebecca\u2019s scream and the door banging open, which probably explains why those two were standing over me with flashlights in hand. I gradually became aware of a dull murmur that I recognized as Rebecca asking me, \u201cPlease wake up, please please please wake up,\u201d as she shook me. She just kept saying it over and over again, kept sobbing and shaking me.</p>\n<p>When my vision cleared enough, I glanced over and saw that her eyes were completely red, like she\u2019d been crying for a while. Trying to muster some shred of manliness, I found myself speaking in a surprisingly calm voice, given how I was actually feeling. I remember distinctly what I said, word for word.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet those fucking flashlights out of my face, you douchebags.\u201d</p>\n<p>Expecting a laugh or at least some reciprocal insults, I was kinda shocked when they just looked at each other quizzically, seemingly surprised.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 you\u2019re okay?\u201d Evan asked incredulously.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, why the hell wouldn\u2019t I be? Becca just tied the things too tight, I couldn\u2019t breathe, so I passed out. How long was I out for anyway?\u201d I inquired. Apparently, it had been long enough for them to untie the straightjacket, allowing me to rub a hand across my face.</p>\n<p>Another shared look of disbelief.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude,\u201d Kevin began slowly, \u201cYou\u2019ve been out for like fifteen minutes. We were about to call 911. We kept shaking you\u2014Evan even tried pinching you so hard he drew blood\u2014but you wouldn\u2019t wake up.\u201d</p>\n<p>I felt a cold chill run down my spine, and the straightjacket, hanging limply from my shoulders, suddenly began to feel a bit tighter. Hastening to pull it off, I tried not to look panicked as I threw it to a corner of the room. Rebecca just sat there, still shaking and crying a little bit, and in spite of the ordeal I\u2019d just gone through, I had enough sense to go over and try to comfort her.</p>\n<p>We left that room without a word, geocache be damned, and walked back to the car in complete silence (broken only by the occasional sniffle from Rebecca). The sun started coming up, and as I dropped everyone off at their respective homes, we said quiet goodbyes. Rebecca was the last stop before I finally made the trip home myself. Being the gentleman that I am, I walked her to her door, but she paused at the entry and looked me in the eye.</p>\n<p>In the light of the gray dawn, I could see her eyes were still reddened from all the crying. She was very quiet, and she said, \u201cI have to ask you something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah sure, what is it?\u201d I said, half expecting another \u201cYou sure you\u2019re alright?\u201d like I\u2019d been getting the whole ride home.</p>\n<p>She surprised me by asking, \u201cDo you know how long it took Evan and Kevin to get the door open?\u201d Her eyes held a look that I could never forget. It was raw fear. Something happened in that fraction of time between me blacking out and them getting in there that had absolutely terrified her. And seeing that look, I realized. I was blacked out for fifteen minutes. How long was she alone in that room?</p>\n<p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d I replied slowly, \u201chow long?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFive minutes. They said it took five minutes for them to open that stupid door. I was in there and I saw you, and I saw\u2014\u201c she broke off, another sob stopping her midsentence. At that point, I didn\u2019t want to know. I still don\u2019t want to know.</p>\n<p>I gripped her by the shoulders and said firmly, \u201cRebecca. It doesn\u2019t matter. No matter what you saw. I\u2019m here, you\u2019re here, we\u2019re both safe. It doesn\u2019t matter. Nothing bad will happen. I promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>She just nodded numbly, opened her door, and walked inside her house. The next time I saw her, she was back to her usual self. But whenever I bring up that night to her, she freezes up and turns to stone, refusing to discuss it.</p>\n<p>I stand by what I said before. I don\u2019t know what happened in that room. And I don\u2019t ever want to know. But I still have nightmares about those two glowing red lights in the darkness.

For those who don\u2019t know what geocaching is, it\u2019s essentially a worldwide scavenger hunt. People will select sites and conceal a \u201cgeo-cache\u201d somewhere unobtrusive, then post GPS coordinates on geocaching websites where other searchers can download the cords and locate the cache. Usually, people who have found the object (often it\u2019s a chest or something hollow) will leave a note or small personal memento for future searchers to find and appreciate.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There are several types of geocaches, and most of them are thematic in nature (i.e. scenic destinations, romantic sites, hard-to-reach areas, etc.) This story begins when my friends and I decided to try a series of purportedly haunted locales within about an hour\u2019s drive of our hometown. It began innocently enough\u2014most of the sites had \u201cspooky\u201d backstories that were, of course, entirely fabricated. So we had a great time scaring the piss out of each other and generally creeping ourselves out.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019d begun searching after the sun had set to enhance the creep factor, but by around midnight, most of our large group had dwindled off and gone their separate ways. When we reached our last coord, there was just myself, Rebecca, Kevin, and Evan left, and we were determined to knock it off our list.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nRebecca was our guide for the night, in charge of putting in the coordinates and reading us the backstory behind each site. So, while I drove, she began reading about the last one out loud to the rest of us. Now, I\u2019m paraphrasing here, but it was something along the lines of:\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cHenckel Asylum: constructed in the early 1900\u2019s, the James Henckel Asylum was built to house a burgeoning population of the criminally insane. Men who had committed vile crimes (rape, murder, torture) without signs of remorse were deemed mentally unstable and sent to this facility for further study and rehabilitation. Once committed, very few criminals were ever released back into society, and those that were usually had been given frontal lobotomies (a popular experimental procedure at the time) or electroshock therapy, both of which rendered the patient nearly braindead, capable of performing only rudimentary tasks.//\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0//Stories: Contemporary visitors to the Asylum report hearing banging noises, cell doors opening and closing, and hearing cackling laughter that is abruptly cut short.\u201d//\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was pretty standard fare compared to the rest of the sites we\u2019d visited that night, and we naturally had a good time psyching each other out for the next fifteen minutes while I drove us to the Asylum. We\u2019d all heard about it (it was in our local area after all) and we knew it had been condemned and abandoned since as long as any of us could remember, so we figured it\u2019d be a great place to run around and be reckless teenagers without risk of getting yelled at by the cops.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When we finally arrived, it looked like something straight out of one of those cheesy B-movies they show on SyFy. Chain link fence with barbed wire around the perimeter, two guard towers flanking the main gate (which was, of course, chained and locked shut with a big NO TRESPASSING sign hanging from it). The asylum itself was decrepit, looking like it hadn\u2019t been touched for decades\u2014which was surprising, since we grew up in a pretty nice area, where the municipal lawmakers tried to keep everything looking spiffy for the tourists.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Needless to say, we promptly ignored the sign on the front gate and hauled ourselves over, cameras and GPS in hand, and walked towards the asylum. Now, given our attitude towards the previous sites, you\u2019ve probably gathered that I\u2019m somewhat of a skeptic. I believe that there are paranormal things that can\u2019t be explained (yet) but I\u2019m not exactly summoning demons in front of a bathroom mirror. So when we opened the main door to the asylum (conveniently unlocked), I dismissed the cold burst of wind as just stale pent-up air rushing out after being trapped inside for so long. My friends\u2019 bravado, however, quickly disappeared and they began shuffling their feet nervously at the entrance, hesitant to cross that invisible threshold.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I took point, chivvying them along with prodding taunts and eventually everyone was inside. It wasn\u2019t as bad as I thought it\u2019d be. Things were relatively clean, and the entire building looked like it had been gutted. The paint was peeling, tiles popping up here and there, and the metal trim near the baseboards of the wall was in desperate need of some Rust-B-Gone, but aside from that, the place was entirely empty. No crazy-ass chairs with leather straps, no gurneys lying haphazardly around, just an old reception desk and two hallways leading off to the different wings.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWe explored for a few minutes, freaking ourselves out whenever we heard an old pipe rattle or rat squeak, but otherwise, it was relatively uneventful. Our fears safely suppressed by the presence of each other, we began to get more adventurous, opening doors and peeking inside. The rooms were all empty, of course. Whatever company had been contracted to clear the place out did a pretty decent job of removing any creepy d\u00e9cor.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bravado returning by the minute, Evan and Kevin dropped back without Rebecca or me noticing. They began running around, making noises to try and scare us (I\u2019m not gonna lie, it worked until I realized they were gone and probably the cause of all the racket), then returned laughing and breathless to a decidedly paler Rebecca. She seemed to be a lot more put off by the whole place than the rest of us, or at least she didn\u2019t hide it as well. She quietly suggested we leave.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nNot to be outdone by the other guys of the group, I told her she was more than welcome to wait in the car if she wanted, but I was gonna stick around for a few more minutes. Exasperated, but defeated, she finally caved and followed us where the GPS was leading\u2014the second floor.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is where I started to feel genuinely scared. Before, I was just kinda creeped out, but there was something about that whole floor that literally gave me shivers, despite it being a warm summer night. We started opening doors like before, but we were all a lot more sober about it. I guess I wasn\u2019t the only one who was feeling weird. Finally, about midway through the hall, we opened the door to a room, and there, lying in the middle of the floor, was an honest-to-god straightjacket. I\u2019m not bullshitting you, every other room was devoid of objects, but there it was. A fucking straightjacket, in the middle of the floor of some random-ass room in a condemned mental asylum. We all kinda looked at each other with raised eyebrows, as if to say \u201cUh\u2026 guys? You seeing what I\u2019m seeing?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And of course, trying to be a macho man to show off for Rebecca, I piped up with the most ridiculous idea I could think of at the time.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDude, I\u2019m gonna put it on.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Years of horror flicks and creepypasta should have trained me to NOT put on the creepy straightjacket, in the creepy hall, in the creepy asylum. But teenage dumbfuckery won over, and once the words were out, I couldn\u2019t just wuss out.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nNobody said anything, they just kinda looked at me expectantly, waiting to see if I\u2019d follow through with my boast. Determined not to be called a pussy for the remainder of the night, I walked forward into the room and bent down to pick up the moth-ridden restraining device. As I got closer though, I noticed it wasn\u2019t moth-ridden at all, but was actually in pretty decent condition (that is, compared to the rest of the place, which as I\u2019ve mentioned, was a shambles). I mean, it had a few stains here and there, but it didn\u2019t really smell and it seemed intact enough to put on.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As soon as I picked it up, though, I got this overwhelming sense of dread. You know, that drop in the pit of your stomach right as you go over the lip of a roller coaster? That feeling, in the bottom of your gut that says \u201cI\u2019m gonna die, I just know it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yeah, well I got that. Really strong. And totally ignored it. My desire not to die was outweighed, as it often is in teenagers, by my need to look cool for my friends. So I slipped my hands in the sleeves, one at a time, until it hung loosely from my shoulders.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now, if you\u2019ve ever seen a straightjacket, you know that you can\u2019t tie it up yourself. The whole point is to essentially cross your arms across your chest and tie the sleeves behind your back to prevent whoever\u2019s inside from moving their arms (presumably, to stop them from hurting themselves or others). So as I stood there in the middle of the room, I called out to Rebecca, \u201cHey Becca, help me tie this thing off.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She looked (if you\u2019ll excuse the pun) pale as a ghost, but she managed to squeak out, \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t think this is a good idea\u2026\u201d But again, after some prodding and encouraging, I convinced her to begin tying the sleeves behind my back. Evan and Kevin just stood in the doorway, expressions a mix of admiration and incredulity. At that point in time, I felt like a badass.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFor about three seconds.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As soon as Rebecca finished up the last lace, the door to the cell slammed shut, right in Kevin and Evan\u2019s faces. I never felt a breeze, and when I asked them later, both of them fervently denied closing it themselves. Skeptic that I am, I still chalk it up to us leaving the front door open and changing air pressures and all that. But it scared the piss out of us nonetheless.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then I felt a pressure on my chest, like someone was sitting on it (or as if someone was pulling the sleeves tighter behind me) and it began to get harder to breathe. I couldn\u2019t even summon enough air to whisper, much less call out for help. My vision narrowed to tiny specks, and I swear I heard someone laughing shrilly as I neared unconsciousness. The pressure increased with a sudden tug, and my world went black.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When I woke up, my vision was foggy. Or at least, I thought it was, until I realized it wasn\u2019t just foggy. It was dark. Like staring through a lens that\u2019s been collecting soot. I blinked a few times, and the darkness waivered, but didn\u2019t dissipate. Now, I\u2019ve passed out and blacked out before, but whenever I woke up, it was nothing like that. Either my vision gradually cleared up, or it was blurry, but never in my life have I been able to recreate the shadowy haze I saw in the asylum that night. Then, from the murky depths, two small pinpoints of light appeared a few inches in front of my face, glaring a lurid red\u2014and a dim echo of the laughter I heard before surrounded me. As soon as they appeared, however, they were replaced by two brilliant shafts of incandescence\u2014Evan and Kevin, shining flashlights down on my face.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The last thing I remember hearing before I lost consciousness was Rebecca\u2019s scream and the door banging open, which probably explains why those two were standing over me with flashlights in hand. I gradually became aware of a dull murmur that I recognized as Rebecca asking me, \u201cPlease wake up, please please please wake up,\u201d as she shook me. She just kept saying it over and over again, kept sobbing and shaking me.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When my vision cleared enough, I glanced over and saw that her eyes were completely red, like she\u2019d been crying for a while. Trying to muster some shred of manliness, I found myself speaking in a surprisingly calm voice, given how I was actually feeling. I remember distinctly what I said, word for word.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cGet those fucking flashlights out of my face, you douchebags.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Expecting a laugh or at least some reciprocal insults, I was kinda shocked when they just looked at each other quizzically, seemingly surprised.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 you\u2019re okay?\u201d Evan asked incredulously.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYeah, why the hell wouldn\u2019t I be? Becca just tied the things too tight, I couldn\u2019t breathe, so I passed out. How long was I out for anyway?\u201d I inquired. Apparently, it had been long enough for them to untie the straightjacket, allowing me to rub a hand across my face.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Another shared look of disbelief.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDude,\u201d Kevin began slowly, \u201cYou\u2019ve been out for like fifteen minutes. We were about to call 911.

Jack was used to the days when getting to Site 19 required two hidden tunnels, a parking lot in front of an abandoned hospital, and two elevator rides. The dismantling of the Veil Protocol had any number of benefits for the Foundation, and far more benefits for humankind as a whole. Nevertheless, Jack never could get over the fact that it was simply far less cool to answer a receptionist's page and be waved through.

Jack pulled the car around to face towards the gates and put the top down.

Jack could hear the little beast two and a half hallways before he reached it. Of all the organic nonhumanoid SCPs they had captured over the centuries, this one in particular stood out as an unspeakably annoying creature. Jack removed the AR-68 helmet from the nearby armory and slipped it on, along with one grenade. Walking to the containment chamber, he removed his flexipad and began to narrate.</p>\n<p>\"By order of the United Nations Secretary of Secure Containment, that being myself, termination order for SCP-1013 has been issued on this day, 25 December 2231, at this time, uh\u2026\" Jack checked the clock. \"\u20262243 hours.

Two SCPs remaining.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Jack's next destination lay three floors down. The elevator ride was smooth, just as he remembered. He was glad that some part of this was comfortable. 1013 was a legitimate pleasure to get rid of. It was one of Clef's last requests, actually; Jack remembered it from the wake. This, however, was not going to be pleasant.</p>\n<p>SCP-5432 had been contained for half a century now, and she had aged normally during that time. She was sitting on her bed when Jack entered the other end of the airlock.</p>\n<p>\"Hello, Josephine,\" Jack said.</p>\n<p>Josephine sat quietly, chewing on a fifty-pound note.</p>\n<p>\"Josephine, it's time. I don't know how well you can understand me, but I'm sorry. I brought you a gift.\" Jack slipped a wrapped package of $1000 Treasury notes in through the slot.</p>\n<p>She perked up considerably. Looking up from where she sat, her eyes gleamed. She dragged herself across the floor with her hands to the airlock and grabbed the notes. Without unwrapping them first, she chewed through the plastic to get to the bills.</p>\n<p>Jack began narrating. \"SCP-5432, also known as Patient Four in the Great Plague of 2182. Patient Zero apprehended, contained, and decommissioned 3 May 2183.\" Jack meant that Patient Zero had been drained of his bodily fluids and vivisected in search of a cure. They had killed seven patients doing that. Most of them had belonged to the terrorist group that had created the virus in the first place. Not all of them. And not Josephine.</p>\n<p>Jack had laced the bills with cyanide. He had also tripped the morphine gas in her room for this event. She would hardly feel anything. She kept chewing monomaniacally. As she slowed down, her head winding around dizzily, her eyes half-focused on Jack's. \"Are\u2026are we\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, Josie. I promise.\"</p>\n<p>\"Are\u2026are we\u2026are we cool yet?\" Josie's half-dead eyes pleaded for the answer. \"Are we cool yet? ARE WE COOL YET?\" The screeching of her voice was as haunting as ever. Jack's mind flashed back to the days, decades ago, when those words were being screamed down corridors.</p>\n<p>\"Go to sleep, Josie.\" Jack narrated into the flexipad, \"SCP-5432 decommissioned 25 December 2231, 2258 hours.\"</p>\n<p>Her eyes faded for the last time. She lay on the ground, a half-eaten bill hanging from her mouth. Jack walked away.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>One last stop. The containment chamber was at the bottom of the building, making the elevator ride a bit farther than before. He hadn't come down this way in a long time, well over a century. Not since the Unveiling. Not since the creature he was here for had arrived.</p>\n<p>It used to be kept out of Site 19, back in the old building. One of the greatest benefits of the Unveiling was the scientific research that came with opening Foundation research to the rest of the world and seeing what came back. Since the advancements in containment that had come from that, there hadn't been a breach from this chamber in decades. The elevator slowed to a stop.</p>\n<p>Jack exited into a well-lit hallway. There was one room on this floor, at the far end, with a speaker grate attached to a translation device. They had found out some time ago that the beast was always talking, often at telepathic wavelengths or ultrasonic pitches. It had taken years to work out all of the nuances and process it into audible speech, but the result was\u2026interesting.</p>\n<p>\"GOOD EVENING DOCTOR BRIGHT,\" the speaker intoned. \"WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE TONIGHT.\"</p>\n<p>Jack cleared his throat. \"You're more polite than I recall. That's a development.\"</p>\n<p>\"YOU ARE STILL FILTH TO ME,\" the creature said. \"MY TEETH STILL ACHE FOR YOUR BLOOD. BUT I AM CONTENT TO WAIT FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. THIS IS THE LONGEST I HAVE EVER BEEN CONTAINED IN ONE PLACE, AND I MUST SHOW SOME RESPECT. I DO NOT EXPECT YOU TO UNDERSTAND, DOCTOR.\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't go by Dr. Bright anymore,\" Jack said. \"I'm barely that person anymore. We've all moved on. I'm the only one left alive, anyway.\"</p>\n<p>\"THE LIST OF THE DEAD IS LENGTHY, AND I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR SO FEW OF THEM. IT IS SORROWFUL. WHAT SHALL I CALL YOU THEN.\"</p>\n<p>\"Just Jack,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"VERY WELL JACK. WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE THIS EVENING.\"</p>\n<p>\"I have a gift. For you.\" Jack said. \"It's time to go.\"</p>\n<p>\"GO?\"</p>\n<p>\"Go. We're done containing you, and you may leave.\"</p>\n<p>The beast, so far as it could pull off body language, seemed confused.</p>\n<p>\"No, I'm serious.\"</p>\n<p>\"YOU ARE A LIAR AND A SOCIOPATH, JACK. YOU HAVE KILLED AS MANY OR MORE THAN I HAVE AT LEAST IN THE MOST RECENT CENTURIES.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's not me anymore,\" Jack said uncomfortably. \"We've changed. The Foundation doesn't exist any more. We don't do those things any more.\"</p>\n<p>\"YOU ARE A LIAR EVEN TO YOURSELF. WHY WOULD YOU RELEASE ME.\"</p>\n<p>\"Two reasons. First, we live in a remarkable world now. We've traveled to star systems far away, spread ourselves out across two dozen planets. The Earth is used up, drained as far as possible, so we've evacuated the planet. There are less than twenty people left here, and as far as I know, they're all sitting on a ship, waiting for me. After midnight tonight, this planet will be human-free. You won't be a threat anymore. We've even gotten the rest of the SCPs off-world. There's no need to keep you here.\"</p>\n<p>The monster paused. \"WHAT IS THE SECOND REASON.\"</p>\n<p>\"It wouldn't have been possible without you.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, JACK.\"</p>\n<p>\"It was a casual containment breach for you. We had trapped you at Site 19 temporarily during\u2026some crisis or another, I can't recall which. You broke out, killed six that day. And in the course of that, you ended up in one containment chamber in particular.\"</p>\n<p>\"JACK I DO NOT RECALL THESE EVENTS\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"Getting to that. You broke into 055's containment chamber. We have no idea what happened next inside there, but two things happened. First, eighteen iterations of you appeared in major cities, wreaking havoc. Not complete copies of you, just imitations; they all died pretty quickly once our task forces arrived. But that was about it for the Veil Protocol after that. So congratulations, I suppose.\"</p>\n<p>\"WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOU\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"We've never understood it, but apparently you did something to 055. You reappeared in your chamber after we killed the last copy, forgetting everything. We never particularly wanted to let you in on it. But 055 started putting out energy after that. Just a trickle, then more and more as time went on. We were able to harness it, thanks to the combined efforts of the Foundation, the GOC, the UIU, everybody. We couldn't have done it without global support, the kind we never would have had before Rampage Day. It changed the world. You changed the world, in a good way. For once.\"</p>\n<p>The beast was silent. It was like old times again.</p>\n<p>\"So, you're free, as of\u2026as soon as I'm out of the building. The programs are prewritten. I hit one button, once I'm safely away, and you can leave as soon as you like.\"</p>\n<p>The beast was silent.</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, I don't want to mess around with weepy goodbyes either. I hope, and I mean this with all my heart, that we never see each other again.\" Jack turned to leave.</p>\n<p>\"JACK.\"</p>\n<p>Jack paused.</p>\n<p>\"MAY I SEE THE ARTIFACT FOR ONE LAST TIME.\"</p>\n<p>Jack stopped to think if there was any way the lizard could exploit the amulet to its advantage and couldn't think of any. He pulled the amulet out and showed it to the beast. \"I'm still in here. Some things don't change.\"</p>\n<p>\"THERE ARE ASPECTS OF THAT ARTIFACT THAT YOU WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND. REFRACTIONS OF LIGHT THAT YOU WILL NEVER SEE. THINGS I COULD NOT EXPLAIN TO YOU EVEN WERE I SO INCLINED. 'GOODBYE', I BELIEVE IS THE EXPRESSION.\" The beast retreated to a corner of its chamber and became quiet.</p>\n<p>Jack turned and walked to the elevator. The ride up to the surface was long, and uncomfortable. Once in his car, he opened the flexi, tapped four times, and put it back. He turned the ignition.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Jack was at the spaceport boarding the flight when the flexi vibrated again. He had programmed Site 19's cameras to follow what happened, and the show was apparently over. He watched the footage as the preflight checks were completed.</p>\n<p>2345: All containment blocks drop. The monster waits for a moment before springing for the exit. It races to the open elevator and crawls up the shaft.</p>\n<p>2354: The creature reaches the ground level, knowing instinctively when it arrives. It rips through the steel door with its teeth and emerges onto the floor of Site 19. It looks from side to side momentarily, then rushes for the enormous glass door. It is standing open.</p>\n<p>2356: The lizard arrives outside. There is a moment when it looks at the giant gate and looks\u2026suspicious, almost. It knows its former containers, knows what they are capable of. It knows what Dr. Bright is capable of, wonders how sincere he is about this transformation of his. The pause is just for a second, but all this is present. The lizard could go through the gate, or go around it; crawl over the walls or smash them. When the lizard slowly, tentatively starts snaking towards the gate, Jack believes it has made a decision. It has decided to do something not out of fear, not out of suspicion, but out of hope. It has not known hope in a very, very long time, but perhaps it decides that it is time to do something new.</p>\n<p>2358: The lizard reaches the gate. What happens now is unrecorded, is likely unrecordable. This was technology nobody knew about; not the government, not the rest of the Containment Department, nobody. A bright blue flash of light, right when it passes under the gate. Jack doesn't know what it feels like for the beast to become mortal for the first time, but it doesn't have long to know the feeling.</p>\n<p>2359: Site 19 warheads detonate. Something else the government didn't know about. Two directly beneath the gate, in fact.</p>\n<p>\"SCP-682 decommissioned 25 December 2231, 2359 hours. Site 19 closed at that time.

Above, an old glass chandelier hangs, ornamented with beautiful lights. On the north wall stands an impossibly large portrait of the same two men \u2013 shaking hands and smiling, their once jet black hair now dull gray.</p>\n<p>There's the sound of cutlery moving about, of cups being lifted and then replaced.</p>\n<p>\u201cKeats,\u201d one says.</p>\n<p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe need to stop.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh? Oh! I agree completely, the Oracle stock is played out and useless to us now. We should look to invest in clean -\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot stocks, Keats.\u201d</p>\n<p>Both men put their cutlery down in unison and look at each other. They've been friends for so long that neither manages to muster up one hundred percent of the steel possible in their gaze.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you talking about, Bill? I have to say, your train of thought is sometimes too fast for me to catch.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know exactly what I'm talking about.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI'm afraid I don't.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess I have to spell it out for you, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose.\u201d</p>\n<p>And here the first speaker -Old Wild Bill, if that matters- looks genuinely angry. He almost stands, thinks better of it, and stops himself. Silence hangs about the room like a condemned man.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2026this, Keats.\u201d He spreads his arms out around him in exasperation, showing off their grand surroundings. Indeed, the room seems better suited for the upper class streets of London, Washington, Tokyo, or Moscow. Who'd believe it was buried meters deep in Australian dirt? Who'd believe above these men's heads was a statue that would kill you, an immortal lizard, and perhaps worst of all, something red? Who'd believe that below them, even deeper still, was a nuclear warhead with a 20 megaton yield?</p>\n<p>As it turns out, quite a lot of people.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you unsatisfied with the Retreat Room, Bill?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cListen to me, you little shit.\u201d Bill had taken this tone with the other man only a handful of times in their long, long acquittance, and it slaps Keats awake.</p>\n<p>Old Wild Bill stands, and in that moment, he no longer is an old man, but the warrior once called Laughing Bull. His hands, tough black leathery things, come down hard on the table. \"I've known you for a long time, William. I know you better than your old whore of a mother knows you. I have stood behind you in all your endeavors; even the ones that were monstrous. It was by my will that my old tribe did not rip your scalp off on the spot when you came riding into our camp. I talked to you, befriended you; you were inquisitive and intelligent, but lacking in humanity.\"</p>\n<p>The other man rolls his eyes and scoffs at the word \"humanity\".</p>\n<p>\"It's true. I followed you because\u2026I cared for you, Keats. You were a good friend, despite your greed. But I will not let you hold the world for ransom any longer.\"</p>\n<p>Keats merely takes up a napkin and dabs at his chin and mouth.</p>\n<p>\"Have you nothing to say for yourself?\"</p>\n<p>\u201cI'm waiting for you to finish this tired little tirade. Or would you rather me continue this story? Should I recount the tale of how the metal in your backwards little tribe's sacred 'relic' responded to my touch? Or should I yell loudly about what we found there? We could take this out in the hall, if you please.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"The Factory is a mistake, Keats. It is\u2026\" He searches for the right word. \"\u2026not a thing of man. We are not meant to create in such a way.\"</p>\n<p>\"You are correct about one thing there, at least. It's not of man. It is mine. The Factory is my will made reality. And an effective tool to impose my reality on anyone who cares to disagree.\"</p>\n<p>\"You're mad.\"</p>\n<p>\"Insults now, is it?\"</p>\n<p>\"Do you realize how old we are, Keats? Why won't you see reason? I am two hundred and ten today. I have watched my entire family die. Ever since you created that damn water -\"</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, the Fountain of Youth. Not my most graceful or original creation, but it works.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bill's rage was growing. He just looked at the other man and gritted his teeth. Keats noted this and grinned shallowly.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd who would you tell about this grand conspiracy theory, Bill? The other O5? They are mine. A man's creations can never turn against him. You would know that, wouldn't you, Bill? You're the one who produced the most humans with my Factory. What were their names, again? Alto and Jack? Oh, and there was the one that looked like your son. The old you broke. 'Doctor' Gears, was it?\"</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up, Keats.\"</p>\n<p>\"I think not. You see, I have known of your growing dissent for some time, and I have planned this moment. Perfectly, I might add. Do you think I would honestly let you walk in here one day and end the world's greatest and longest con? No, Bill. There are still countries to bribe, blackmail, and ruin. There is still money and power out there that I do not yet have. Do you realize what leaders will pay to keep their people safe and their rule secure? I simply cannot allow you to ruin this job for me, despite old friendships.\" Keat's voice had slowly descended in tone; where there was once affable enjoyment had been replaced with cold stillness.</p>\n<p>\"I'll kill you, William Keats. And then I'll kill your toys.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cBig words from an old Indian. Excuse me, Native American.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou piece of shit -\u201d</p>\n<p>Keats had been thumbing the action on his gun since Bill had begun speaking. Two shots rang out, and Wild Bill suddenly found he no longer had knees. There was a scream, and Keats stood, wiping at his mouth with a napkin. In his other hand was a smoking matte-black revolver.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd history repeats, it seems. The noble English have once again prevailed against our savage foes. \u201d He presses an intercom button built into the table, and a quiet speaker crackles to life.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Mr. One?\u201d An extremely chipper female voice echos throughout the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cMrs. Escot? Which Sites are Alto Clef and Jack Bright currently stationed at?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOne minute please, sir.\u201d Keyboard taps. \u201cDr. Clef is stationed at Site 19 sir, but he is currently visiting Dr. Bright at Site 23.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAhhh, 23. The renegades. How convenient; three birds with a single stone. Mrs. Escot, please arrange for SCP-173 and one of our cloning devices to be transferred to Site 23. Once they are inside, please remotely seal the exits and arrange for the two to interact. You have my permission to use our sleeper agents.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, sir! Sir, shall I detonate Site 23's nuclear warhead afterward?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmmm\u2026no, but please ensure that the Site's entrance is buried. And see to it that a cleaning crew is set down to the Retreat Room. Tell them to bring mops.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes sir! Thank you, sir!\u201d Click. The speaker turns off.</p>\n<p>Wild Bill lays on the floor, bleeding and barely holding onto consciousness. Keats walks over and stands over him, the gun still in his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cAny pithy last words, Bill?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bill's left hand weakly extends a middle finger.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow predictable.\u201d There is a single crack, and the world's second oldest man dies.</p>\n<p>Keats looks at the broken body of his only friend, shrugs, and pockets the gun. He removes a cigarette and a lighter from his breast pocket, and lights up. The smell of tobacco mixes with the smell of gun smoke, and for a brief second, William Keats, pride of his father and light in his mother's eyes, feels a deep sense of nostalgia and accomplishment.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou ran a good con.

Above, an old glass chandelier hangs, ornamented with beautiful lights. On the north wall stands an impossibly large portrait of the same two men \u2013 shaking hands and smiling, their once jet black hair now dull gray. \n\n\n\nThere's the sound of cutlery moving about, of cups being lifted and then replaced. \n\n\n\n\u201cKeats,\u201d one says. \n\n\n\n\u201cHm?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe need to stop.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh? Oh! I agree completely, the Oracle stock is played out and useless to us now. We should look to invest in clean -\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNot stocks, Keats.\u201d\n\n\n\nBoth men put their cutlery down in unison and look at each other. They've been friends for so long that neither manages to muster up one hundred percent of the steel possible in their gaze. \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about, Bill? I have to say, your train of thought is sometimes too fast for me to catch.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou know exactly what I'm talking about.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI'm afraid I don't.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI guess I have to spell it out for you, then.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI suppose.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd here the first speaker -Old Wild Bill, if that matters- looks genuinely angry. He almost stands, thinks better of it, and stops himself. Silence hangs about the room like a condemned man. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou...this, Keats.\u201d He spreads his arms out around him in exasperation, showing off their grand surroundings. Indeed, the room seems better suited for the upper class streets of London, Washington, Tokyo, or Moscow. Who'd believe it was buried meters deep in Australian dirt? Who'd believe above these men's heads was a statue that would kill you, an immortal lizard, and perhaps worst of all, something red? Who'd believe that below them, even deeper still, was a nuclear warhead with a 20 megaton yield? \n\n\n\nAs it turns out, quite a lot of people. \n\n\n\n\u201cAre you unsatisfied with the Retreat Room, Bill?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cListen to me, you little shit.\u201d Bill had taken this tone with the other man only a handful of times in their long, long acquittance, and it slaps Keats awake.\n\n\n\n\n\nOld Wild Bill stands, and in that moment, he no longer is an old man, but the warrior once called Laughing Bull. His hands, tough black leathery things, come down hard on the table. \"I've known you for a long time, William. I know you better than your old whore of a mother knows you. I have stood behind you in all your endeavors; even the ones that were monstrous. It was by my will that my old tribe did not rip your scalp off on the spot when you came riding into our camp. I talked to you, befriended you; you were inquisitive and intelligent, but lacking in humanity.\"\n\n\n\nThe other man rolls his eyes and scoffs at the word \"humanity\".\n\n\n\n\"It's true. I followed you because...I cared for you, Keats. You were a good friend, despite your greed. But I will not let you hold the world for ransom any longer.\" \n\n\n\nKeats merely takes up a napkin and dabs at his chin and mouth.\n\n\n\n\"Have you nothing to say for yourself?\"\n\n\n\n\u201cI'm waiting for you to finish this tired little tirade. Or would you rather me continue this story?\u00a0\u00a0Should I recount the tale of how the metal in your backwards little tribe's sacred 'relic' responded to my touch? Or should I yell loudly about what we found there? We could take this out in the hall, if you please.\u201d\n\n\n\n\"The Factory is a mistake, Keats. It is...\" He searches for the right word. \"...not a thing of man. We are not meant to create in such a way.\"\n\n\n\n\"You are correct about one thing there, at least. It's not of man. It is mine. The Factory is my will made reality. And an effective tool to impose my reality on anyone who cares to disagree.\"\n\n\n\n\"You're mad.\"\n\n\n\n\"Insults now, is it?\"\n\n\n\n\"Do you realize how old we are, Keats? Why won't you see reason? I am two hundred and ten today. I have watched my entire family die. Ever since you created that damn water -\"\n\n\n\n\u201cAh, the Fountain of Youth. Not my most graceful or original creation, but it works.\u201d\n\n\n\nBill's rage was growing. He just looked at the other man and gritted his teeth.\u00a0\u00a0Keats noted this and grinned shallowly. \n\n\n\n\u201cAnd who would you tell about this grand conspiracy theory, Bill? The other O5? They are mine. A man's creations can never turn against him. You would know that, wouldn't you, Bill? You're the one who produced the most humans with my Factory. What were their names, again? Alto and Jack? Oh, and there was the one that looked like your son. The old you broke. 'Doctor' Gears, was it?\"\n\n\n\n\u201cShut up, Keats.\"\n\n\n\n\"I think not. You see, I have known of your growing dissent for some time, and I have planned this moment. Perfectly, I might add. Do you think I would honestly let you walk in here one day and end the world's greatest and longest con? No, Bill. There are still countries to bribe, blackmail, and ruin. There is still money and power out there that I do not yet have. Do you realize what leaders will pay to keep their people safe and their rule secure? I simply cannot allow you to ruin this job for me, despite old friendships.\" Keat's voice had slowly descended in tone; where there was once affable enjoyment had been replaced with cold stillness. \n\n\n\n\"I'll kill you, William Keats. And then I'll kill your toys.\"\n\n\n\n\u201cBig words from an old Indian. Excuse me, Native American.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou piece of shit -\u201d \n\n\n\nKeats had been thumbing the action on his gun since Bill had begun speaking. Two shots rang out, and Wild Bill suddenly found he no longer had knees. There was a scream, and Keats stood, wiping at his mouth with a napkin. In his other hand was a smoking matte-black revolver. \n\n\n\n\u201cAnd history repeats, it seems. The noble English have once again prevailed against our savage foes. \u201d He presses an intercom button built into the table, and a quiet speaker crackles to life.\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. One?\u201d An extremely chipper female voice echos throughout the room.\n\n\n\n\u201cMrs. Escot? Which Sites are Alto Clef and Jack Bright currently stationed at?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOne minute please, sir.\u201d Keyboard taps. \u201cDr. Clef is stationed at Site 19 sir, but he is currently visiting Dr. Bright at Site 23.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAhhh, 23. The renegades. How convenient; three birds with a single stone. Mrs. Escot, please arrange for SCP-173 and one of our cloning devices to be transferred to Site 23. Once they are inside, please remotely seal the exits and arrange for the two to interact. You have my permission to use our sleeper agents.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, sir! Sir, shall I detonate Site 23's nuclear warhead afterward?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHmmm...no, but please ensure that the Site's entrance is buried. And see to it that a cleaning crew is set down to the Retreat Room. Tell them to bring mops.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYes\u00a0\u00a0sir! Thank you, sir!\u201d Click. The speaker turns off. \n\n\n\nWild Bill lays on the floor, bleeding and barely holding onto consciousness. Keats walks over and stands over him, the gun still in his hand. \n\n\n\n\u201cAny pithy last words, Bill?\u201d\n\n\n\nBill's left hand weakly extends a middle finger.\n\n\n\n\u201cHow predictable.\u201d There is a single crack, and the world's second oldest man dies. \n\n\n\nKeats looks at the broken body of his only friend, shrugs, and pockets the gun. He removes a cigarette and a lighter from his breast pocket, and lights up. The smell of tobacco mixes with the smell of gun smoke, and for a brief second, William Keats, pride of his father and light in his mother's eyes, feels a deep sense of nostalgia and accomplishment. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou ran a good con. Happy birthday, Bill.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe throws the lit cigarette unto the other man's body and leaves the room. \n\n\n\nTen minutes later, a crew in orange jumpsuits with mops enters the same room, and wordlessly cleans up the body. Thirty minutes later, every single man and woman in Site 23 is trying not to blink. An hour later, and Keats is sitting across from the President of the United States and calmly informing him how easily SCP-682 could be transported into Washington.\n\n\n\nThe next day, a large amount of funds are transferred into the Foundation's coffers. \n\n\n\nIgnoring death and tragedy, the con, and the Foundation, goes on.\n", "references": [], "tags": ["doctor-clef", "factory", "tale"], "title": "The Long Con - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-long-con", "year": 2011}, "the-manager": {"created_at": "2011-06-14T19:06:00", "creator": "thedeadlymoose", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "thedeadlymoose", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/thedeadlymoose", "comment": "", "date": "2011-06-14T19:06:00"}, {"author": "thedeadlymoose", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/thedeadlymoose", "comment": "edit for repetition", "date": "2011-06-14T19:18:00"}, {"author": "thedeadlymoose", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/thedeadlymoose", "comment": "cut another word!", "date": "2011-06-14T19:31:00"}, {"author": "Moor", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/moor", "comment": "Added tags: factory.

The deal is in its final stages and construction will begin sometime in the winter. The proposed laboratory has ample room, and a direct access to the rail line.<br/>\nThe man thinks I'm going to boom the local economy and that a city will spring up because of my work. He doesn't know why I'm really here and what I'm set to accomplish.</p>\n<p>Free energy. Producing enough electricity that we will no longer need wires. Isolated nations could be brought to the modern age through the work of one simple machine.<br/>\nThe orb is the key. I don't know where Jack got it. I just know that there's a perpetual motion to it, and that I've been unable to destroy it and find out what is inside. Striking it with a hammer was useless.<br/>\nUsing a cutting torch only made it warm to the touch. Having someone drive a railroad spike into it bent the spike. Throughout all the tests I've done and ran on this creation, it still continues to roll by itself, in the rough span of a meter.</p>\n<p>Nothing is seeming to animate this. To the ear, there's nothing. It's normally cool as any stone or glass is to the touch, save the rough edges of the flecks of blue material on the surface.<br/>\nI've done everything I can short of smashing it with an industrial pr</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Smashing it with an industrial press caused severe damage to the press. I am now short fifty dollars to pay for the damages.</p>\n<p>June 18th, 1901</p>\n<p>\"Wardenclyffe.\"<br/>\nThe man thinks that my ambition is going to put his name on the map. He has no idea what I have in store for the world. The ball still rolls on the smooth stone floor of the laboratory space, and the sound can get agitating in the dead of the night. I've begun to design a machine that will use the perpetual motion of this orb in order to produce energy, refining it, and focusing it into a coil of iron and copper, using one of my coil designs from earlier modified appropriately. I'm going to need workers if I'm going to power the seaboard. Work shall begin post-haste.</p>\n<p>Edison arrived at the lab the other day. The man, while brilliant, is backwards and not as much of a dreamer as I. He may have won over the masses, but I do not need popularity in order to fulfill my goal.<br/>\nPopularity is the need of lesser men. DC current and AC current will be meaningless when my project succeeds. We shared a glass of tea and my assistant rushed him away to leave when workers arrived with a spool of copper wire.</p>\n<p>Insufferable. Why would you electrocute an elephant just to prove a man wrong? Elephants don't deserve to be electrocuted. The man is an ass, and this emotion is most certainly resentment.<br/>\nI'm allowed emotions! I can resent the man all I please, because our rivalry is chicken seed in comparison to what is to come!</p>\n<p>That poor elephant.</p>\n<p>Ball rolls up obstacles. Placed hand in way, rolled up and over hand. Placed brick in way, rolled over brick.<br/>\nPlaced in front of assistant. Rolled up assistant's leg, up torso and across face, dropped to the opposite side. Not doing that again.<br/>\nAttempts to slow it down and render its direction askew with wooden blocks also futile. Weighing it down with my hand stops it, but</p>\n<p>August 19th, 1901</p>\n<p>Rudimentary test with coil success. Static discharge safe if grounded and when outside 20 feet.<br/>\nMore tests on orb this morning after breakfast. Idea hit me when I woke if I could constrict the size of the meter circumference of the orb's path.<br/>\nConstructed circle of iron using scrap metal, and ..ironically, a path painted by the orb when covered in grease paint. Iron circle to constrict path of orb to that of a foot, as opposed to the usual 1m.<br/>\nTest was a resounding success. Marked speed increase and increase in acceleration. Difficult getting grease paint off.<br/>\nOrb continued at speed until iron ring was removed, then resumed at one meter.</p>\n<p>To call myself puzzled is an understatement. I'd give anything to be able to see what's inside of this small orb of stone. Going to test this via the extremes come Sunday.<br/>\nI need to get okay from local police, assistant can do that. Continuing to design coil apparatus and \"tower\" for orb project. Workers are beginning to construct the base and all things are looking well.<br/>\nI find myself not eating, too busy working. I need to remedy this and slow down for my health, but I'm so close, I can feel it in my very soul. I can help the world, perhaps bring in a new day for civilization.</p>\n<p>And the orb is the key.</p>\n<p>Sunday, August 24th, 1901</p>\n<p>FRUSTRATED</p>\n<p>HITTING ORB WITH STEAM LOCOMOTIVE DERAILED LOCOMOTIVE</p>\n<p>GOING TO SLEEP, TOO FRUSTRATED TO KEEP TRAIN OF THOUGHT</p>\n<p>WHY - GOD DAMNED TRAIN WAS SUPPOSED TO SPLIT IT</p>\n<p>NEVER AGAIN</p>\n<p>IF A BLOODY TRAIN CAN'T CRACK THIS THING OPEN THEN NOTHING ON EARTH CAN</p>\n<p>DOES NOT MATTER, PLAN CONTINUES</p>\n<p>September 11th, 1901</p>\n<p>Found myself sleeping at workbench. Assistant roused me from my sleep, I asked him what time it was.<br/>\nI'd been working into the early dawn hours and still I'm not making appropriate progress. I need to keep the edge in the race for free energy.<br/>\nI have the orb, but Edison may resort to espionage and sabotage. It's not beneath the man if he'll willingly slander my works like he has in the past.<br/>\nHe has the fluke of creating the lightbulb? What if someone else made the light bulb and he took it?</p>\n<p>Paranoia must be due to lack of sleep.</p>\n<p>I hate the damn sound that orb makes when it rolls on sheet metal. Copper containment must be in tube form in final design.</p>\n<p>Copper and iron.</p>\n<p>December 31st, 1901</p>\n<p>A new year is dawning. A new year, and soon my preliminary designs will be finalized, and construction will begin.</p>\n<p>The tower will be tall, over a hundred feet, using wood stabilizers. The idea is the project has to be large, in order to reach the effect necessary for global empowerment.<br/>\nGeorge and I spoke about the money issues. I told him I needed to leave the lab to get to the city and entrusted him with the orb.</p>\n<p>Before I left, I meditated in the laboratory, looking over one of my electrical coils arc electricity through the room.<br/>\nHow can I be wrong when I can -see- the fruits of my designs? I can -see- my designs working?</p>\n<p>I know I'm right. I have to be right, or all of this work is for nothing.</p>\n<p>January 7th, 1902</p>\n<p>My enemies have been very successful in painting me as a poet and visionary.<br/>\nI've at Wardenclyffe for the past few days, thinking of moving laboratory from Houston Street here.</p>\n<p>Tower is still under construction but construction is going very well.<br/>\nI need to be able to think. I need the air around here to clear my head and I'm frustrated and scared out of my mind of the possible outcomes of the device.<br/>\nI could power the entire world with this, or I could ignite the atmosphere in flames and kill all life on earth, or absolutely nothing could happen. I need to try.<br/>\nMankind has lived in the darkness for too long.</p>\n<p>A tubing system has been tested with the orb, and the orb's conductivity, or rather the motion it has, has given the system a strong electrical charge. I need to constrict and focus.<br/>\nI am not a madman. I am a man with vision and the will to see that vision come to fruition.</p>\n<p>Why must I remind myself as such?</p>\n<p>I worry the project has taken a toll on my mental faculties.</p>\n<p>I can't worry now. I have to see this through.</p>\n<p>May 4th, 1902</p>\n<p>Tower needs about a year before the first test of the design.<br/>\nOne year. Worried about money issues. A lot is riding on my success.<br/>\nGeorge had his workers carry in the last of the laboratory equipment to the facility today.<br/>\nThe man's a good friend, but I worry that he may seek employment elsewhere if the money dries out.</p>\n<p>This is why I must succeed. If I don't, I'm going to be in destitution, in debt to men with more pull than I.<br/>\nWord came from the Colorado Springs of the sale of the grounds. It doesn't matter. That laboratory has nothing to give me anymore.</p>\n<p>All work is now to be done in Wardenclyffe. Nothing ties me to Houston Street anymore. I can work here in solitude and without interruption.</p>\n<p>The orb is the key.</p>\n<p>An iron tube, seven inches in diameter, will wrap around a wooden beam in the center of the tower, wrapped in copper wire. Once the electrical charge is built up, it will shoot up the wire and be amplified by the sphere at the top of the tower. The electricity and static charge will then be capable of powering anywhere in the world by 'wobbling' the planet's magnetosphere. I've spent over fifteen years working on this design. It has to work.</p>\n<p>July 10th, 1902</p>\n<p>Today is my birthday.</p>\n<p>The test firing begins one year from now.</p>\n<p>The plan is finalized. All I need to do is complete the tower.</p>\n<p>Money is running dangerously low.<br/>\nJP Morgan and my backers have voiced their doubt.<br/>\nThey will be shown the way. Everyone will.</p>\n<p>I've read of a scientist in Germany, an up-and-comer in the world of physics, who <em>might</em> be able to assist me.<br/>\nThe project won't survive without something commercial. I have to leave this project financially sound.</p>\n<p>Nearly a million has been spent. The great undertaking is nearly complete.<br/>\nThe orb is the key.</p>\n<p>August 30th, 1902</p>\n<p>I haven't slept for over eighty hours. I have to finish the project. Everything is in place.<br/>\nThe [incomprehensible scribbles and a coffee stain] mustn't malfunction.</p>\n<p>November 5th, 1902</p>\n<p>Saw a film today, Le Voyage dans la lune. The movie is about a group of travelers who shoot to the moon in a giant bullet-shaped craft. They encounter space aliens, and manage to get their way back home. I'm not sure where I found the copy, but I allowed myself time to view it in the means of my work. I'd heard rumors that Edison's technicians have been spreading the film about and not giving the director his due cuts. This strikes me JUST as what Thomas would do.</p>\n<p>My hatred and rivalry for this man knows no bounds. I will out shadow him with my design. The Tower shall bring in a new age of humanity and Thomas Alva Edison will be left in the dust!<br/>\nMarconi and I have discussed obtaining the last bit of funds I need for my tower. He seems hesitant and I can see it in his eyes when I talk to him the doubt others share.</p>\n<p>I have no room for doubt. No room.</p>\n<p>His assistance is vital, however. The tower is constructed. We will begin preparations for test firing over the spring. For now, I need to take a moment to rest.<br/>\nPigeon flew into arc of one of the coils earlier today and reminded me of dangers of electricity. Going to miss her. She was one of my favorites of the flock I keep.<br/>\nBuried pigeon in shoebox beside oak tree near laboratory.</p>\n<p>January 1st, 1903</p>\n<p>do\u0161li peniaze na financovanie projektu</p>\n<p>treba mimoriadnych finan\u010dn\u00fdch prostriedkov z podporovate\u013eov</p>\n<p>oni mi dal e\u0161te posledn\u00fa \u0161ancu</p>\n<p>Potrebujem \u0161es\u0165 mesiacov</p>\n<p>pitnej probl\u00e9my pre\u010d</p>\n<p>Orb je k\u013e\u00fa\u010dom</p>\n<p>Febuary 10th, 1903</p>\n<p>Testing the conductivity today.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Test went well. An odd resonance and sound from the tower. Hum?<br/>\nNeed to investigate. Resonance is either a good thing or a bad thing.<br/>\nWorkers and pigeons find sound incredibly unnerving.</p>\n<p>Workers are frightened by the scale of the project. Some of them have voiced their conerns.<br/>\nI tell them they're safe, and that the majority of the current is going into the earth, as per the project's ultimate design.<br/>\nThe majority of them are calmed by this, but some still show hesitance when I flip the switch for conductivity tests.</p>\n<p>The government agents arrived again this morning. They're asking me what's powering the tower, and why I need the carbon tube ring.<br/>\nI ask them what agency they belong to. They tell me they're part of a new unusual incident investigation organization of the Secret Service.<br/>\nThey don't seem very bright. I tell them the 'truth' and back my claims up with old diagrams that they couldn't understand and that were of no use to me.</p>\n<p>They thanked me for the tea I served them and left. That was a close one. I need to prepare for more scrutiny from outside forces.</p>\n<p>March 18th, 1903</p>\n<p>Rolled the orb in chalk and drew a circle on the ground. Washed it off and threw it at a wall as hard as I could. The wall dented, the orb is fine.<br/>\nI doubt this small stone is from our planet. It's so very, very durable, and I'll never be able to find out why it works the way it does. The 'why' no longer matters.<br/>\nThe 'what' does. What does it do. It runs in a circle on its own. It speeds up the tighter its path is constricted. The ring will be small and the energy it will produce will be enough.<br/>\nI washed the orb of the chalky dust and drew a map of the globe in the circle I'd drawn earlier.</p>\n<p>The great marble we live on has some parallels with this little orb. Flecked with blue, spinning forever and ever without a care, in a perpetual circle.</p>\n<p>It's almost ready.</p>\n<p>Two months.</p>\n<p>July 9th</p>\n<p>Running out of money. First test could be my last. I've asked the workers today to prepare for the undertaking of their lives, and that all the work we've done will pay off within twenty four hours.<br/>\nThe faint of heart left after that speech. Only a dozen, two dozen perhaps remain.</p>\n<p>God see me through this.<br/>\nI'm scared out of my mind, and I'm worried I may not survive the next twenty four hours.

The deal is in its final stages and construction will begin sometime in the winter. The proposed laboratory has ample room, and a direct access to the rail line.\n\nThe man thinks I'm going to boom the local economy and that a city will spring up because of my work. He doesn't know why I'm really here and what I'm set to accomplish.\n\n\n\nFree energy. Producing enough electricity that we will no longer need wires. Isolated nations could be brought to the modern age through the work of one simple machine.\n\nThe orb is the key. I don't know where Jack got it. I just know that there's a perpetual motion to it, and that I've been unable to destroy it and find out what is inside. Striking it with a hammer was useless.\n\nUsing a cutting torch only made it warm to the touch. Having someone drive a railroad spike into it bent the spike. Throughout all the tests I've done and ran on this creation, it still continues to roll by itself, in the rough span of a meter.\n\n\n\nNothing is seeming to animate this. To the ear, there's nothing. It's normally cool as any stone or glass is to the touch, save the rough edges of the flecks of blue material on the surface.\n\nI've done everything I can short of smashing it with an industrial pr\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\nSmashing it with an industrial press caused severe damage to the press. I am now short fifty dollars to pay for the damages.\n\n\n\nJune 18th, 1901\n\n\n\n\"Wardenclyffe.\"\n\nThe man thinks that my ambition is going to put his name on the map. He has no idea what I have in store for the world. The ball still rolls on the smooth stone floor of the laboratory space, and the sound can get agitating in the dead of the night. I've begun to design a machine that will use the perpetual motion of this orb in order to produce energy, refining it, and focusing it into a coil of iron and copper, using one of my coil designs from earlier modified appropriately. I'm going to need workers if I'm going to power the seaboard. Work shall begin post-haste.\n\n\n\nEdison arrived at the lab the other day. The man, while brilliant, is backwards and not as much of a dreamer as I. He may have won over the masses, but I do not need popularity in order to fulfill my goal.\n\nPopularity is the need of lesser men. DC current and AC current will be meaningless when my project succeeds. We shared a glass of tea and my assistant rushed him away to leave when workers arrived with a spool of copper wire.\n\n\n\nInsufferable. Why would you electrocute an elephant just to prove a man wrong? Elephants don't deserve to be electrocuted. The man is an ass, and this emotion is most certainly resentment.\n\nI'm allowed emotions! I can resent the man all I please, because our rivalry is chicken seed in comparison to what is to come!\n\n\n\nThat poor elephant.\n\n\n\nBall rolls up obstacles. Placed hand in way, rolled up and over hand. Placed brick in way, rolled over brick.\n\nPlaced in front of assistant. Rolled up assistant's leg, up torso and across face, dropped to the opposite side. Not doing that again.\n\nAttempts to slow it down and render its direction askew with wooden blocks also futile. Weighing it down with my hand stops it, but\n\n\n\nAugust 19th, 1901\n\n\n\nRudimentary test with coil success. Static discharge safe if grounded and when outside 20 feet.\n\nMore tests on orb this morning after breakfast. Idea hit me when I woke if I could constrict the size of the meter circumference of the orb's path.\n\nConstructed circle of iron using scrap metal, and ..ironically, a path painted by the orb when covered in grease paint. Iron circle to constrict path of orb to that of a foot, as opposed to the usual 1m.\n\nTest was a resounding success. Marked speed increase and increase in acceleration. Difficult getting grease paint off.\n\nOrb continued at speed until iron ring was removed, then resumed at one meter.\n\n\n\nTo call myself puzzled is an understatement. I'd give anything to be able to see what's inside of this small orb of stone. Going to test this via the extremes come Sunday.\n\nI need to get okay from local police, assistant can do that. Continuing to design coil apparatus and \"tower\" for orb project. Workers are beginning to construct the base and all things are looking well.\n\nI find myself not eating, too busy working. I need to remedy this and slow down for my health, but I'm so close, I can feel it in my very soul. I can help the world, perhaps bring in a new day for civilization.\n\n\n\nAnd the orb is the key.\n\n\n\nSunday, August 24th, 1901\n\n\n\nFRUSTRATED\n\n\n\nHITTING ORB WITH STEAM LOCOMOTIVE DERAILED LOCOMOTIVE\n\n\n\nGOING TO SLEEP, TOO FRUSTRATED TO KEEP TRAIN OF THOUGHT\n\n\n\nWHY - GOD DAMNED TRAIN WAS SUPPOSED TO SPLIT IT\n\n\n\nNEVER AGAIN\n\n\n\nIF A BLOODY TRAIN CAN'T CRACK THIS THING OPEN THEN NOTHING ON EARTH CAN\n\n\n\nDOES NOT MATTER, PLAN CONTINUES\n\n\n\nSeptember 11th, 1901\n\n\n\nFound myself sleeping at workbench. Assistant roused me from my sleep, I asked him what time it was.\n\nI'd been working into the early dawn hours and still I'm not making appropriate progress. I need to keep the edge in the race for free energy.\n\nI have the orb, but Edison may resort to espionage and sabotage. It's not beneath the man if he'll willingly slander my works like he has in the past.\n\nHe has the fluke of creating the lightbulb? What if someone else made the light bulb and he took it?\n\n\n\nParanoia must be due to lack of sleep.\n\n\n\nI hate the damn sound that orb makes when it rolls on sheet metal. Copper containment must be in tube form in final design.\n\n\n\nCopper and iron.\n\n\n\nDecember 31st, 1901\n\n\n\nA new year is dawning. A new year, and soon my preliminary designs will be finalized, and construction will begin.\n\n\n\nThe tower will be tall, over a hundred feet, using wood stabilizers. The idea is the project has to be large, in order to reach the effect necessary for global empowerment.\n\nGeorge and I spoke about the money issues. I told him I needed to leave the lab to get to the city and entrusted him with the orb.\n\n\n\nBefore I left, I meditated in the laboratory, looking over one of my electrical coils arc electricity through the room.\n\nHow can I be wrong when I can -see- the fruits of my designs? I can -see- my designs working?\n\n\n\nI know I'm right. I have to be right, or all of this work is for nothing.\n\n\n\nJanuary 7th, 1902\n\n\n\nMy enemies have been very successful in painting me as a poet and visionary.\n\nI've at Wardenclyffe for the past few days, thinking of moving laboratory from Houston Street here.\n\n\n\nTower is still under construction but construction is going very well.\n\nI need to be able to think. I need the air around here to clear my head and I'm frustrated and scared out of my mind of the possible outcomes of the device.\n\nI could power the entire world with this, or I could ignite the atmosphere in flames and kill all life on earth, or absolutely nothing could happen. I need to try.\n\nMankind has lived in the darkness for too long.\n\n\n\nA tubing system has been tested with the orb, and the orb's conductivity, or rather the motion it has, has given the system a strong electrical charge. I need to constrict and focus.\n\nI am not a madman. I am a man with vision and the will to see that vision come to fruition.\n\n\n\nWhy must I remind myself as such?\n\n\n\nI worry the project has taken a toll on my mental faculties.\n\n\n\nI can't worry now. I have to see this through.\n\n\n\nMay 4th, 1902\n\n\n\nTower needs about a year before the first test of the design.\n\nOne year. Worried about money issues. A lot is riding on my success.\n\nGeorge had his workers carry in the last of the laboratory equipment to the facility today.\n\nThe man's a good friend, but I worry that he may seek employment elsewhere if the money dries out.\n\n\n\nThis is why I must succeed. If I don't, I'm going to be in destitution, in debt to men with more pull than I.\n\nWord came from the Colorado Springs of the sale of the grounds. It doesn't matter. That laboratory has nothing to give me anymore.\n\n\n\nAll work is now to be done in Wardenclyffe. Nothing ties me to Houston Street anymore. I can work here in solitude and without interruption.\n\n\n\nThe orb is the key.\n\n\n\nAn iron tube, seven inches in diameter, will wrap around a wooden beam in the center of the tower, wrapped in copper wire. Once the electrical charge is built up, it will shoot up the wire and be amplified by the sphere at the top of the tower. The electricity and static charge will then be capable of powering anywhere in the world by 'wobbling' the planet's magnetosphere. I've spent over fifteen years working on this design. It has to work.\n\n\n\nJuly 10th, 1902\n\n\n\nToday is my birthday.\n\n\n\nThe test firing begins one year from now.\n\n\n\nThe plan is finalized. All I need to do is complete the tower.\n\n\n\nMoney is running dangerously low.\n\nJP Morgan and my backers have voiced their doubt.\n\nThey will be shown the way. Everyone will.\n\n\n\nI've read of a scientist in Germany, an up-and-comer in the world of physics, who //might// be able to assist me.\n\nThe project won't survive without something commercial. I have to leave this project financially sound.\n\n\n\nNearly a million has been spent. The great undertaking is nearly complete.\n\nThe orb is the key.\n\n\n\nAugust 30th, 1902\n\n\n\nI haven't slept for over eighty hours. I have to finish the project. Everything is in place.\n\nThe [incomprehensible scribbles and a coffee stain] mustn't malfunction.\n\n\n\nNovember 5th, 1902\n\n\n\nSaw a film today, Le Voyage dans la lune. The movie is about a group of travelers who shoot to the moon in a giant bullet-shaped craft. They encounter space aliens, and manage to get their way back home. I'm not sure where I found the copy, but I allowed myself time to view it in the means of my work. I'd heard rumors that Edison's technicians have been spreading the film about and not giving the director his due cuts. This strikes me JUST as what Thomas would do.\n\n\n\nMy hatred and rivalry for this man knows no bounds. I will out shadow him with my design. The Tower shall bring in a new age of humanity and Thomas Alva Edison will be left in the dust!\n\nMarconi and I have discussed obtaining the last bit of funds I need for my tower. He seems hesitant and I can see it in his eyes when I talk to him the doubt others share.\n\n\n\nI have no room for doubt. No room.\n\n\n\nHis assistance is vital, however. The tower is constructed. We will begin preparations for test firing over the spring. For now, I need to take a moment to rest.\n\nPigeon flew into arc of one of the coils earlier today and reminded me of dangers of electricity. Going to miss her. She was one of my favorites of the flock I keep.\n\nBuried pigeon in shoebox beside oak tree near laboratory.\n\n\n\nJanuary 1st, 1903\n\n\n\ndo\u0161li peniaze na financovanie projektu\n\n\n\ntreba mimoriadnych finan\u010dn\u00fdch prostriedkov z podporovate\u013eov\n\n\n\noni mi dal e\u0161te posledn\u00fa \u0161ancu\n\n\n\nPotrebujem \u0161es\u0165 mesiacov\n\n\n\npitnej probl\u00e9my pre\u010d\n\n\n\nOrb je k\u013e\u00fa\u010dom\n\n\n\nFebuary 10th, 1903\n\n\n\nTesting the conductivity today.\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\nTest went well. An odd resonance and sound from the tower. Hum?\n\nNeed to investigate. Resonance is either a good thing or a bad thing.\n\nWorkers and pigeons find sound incredibly unnerving.\n\n\n\nWorkers are frightened by the scale of the project. Some of them have voiced their conerns.\n\nI tell them they're safe, and that the majority of the current is going into the earth, as per the project's ultimate design.\n\nThe majority of them are calmed by this, but some still show hesitance when I flip the switch for conductivity tests.\n\n\n\nThe government agents arrived again this morning. They're asking me what's powering the tower, and why I need the carbon tube ring.\n\nI ask them what agency they belong to. They tell me they're part of a new unusual incident investigation organization of the Secret Service.\n\nThey don't seem very bright. I tell them the 'truth' and back my claims up with old diagrams that they couldn't understand and that were of no use to me.\n\n\n\nThey thanked me for the tea I served them and left. That was a close one. I need to prepare for more scrutiny from outside forces.\n\n\n\nMarch 18th, 1903\n\n\n\nRolled the orb in chalk and drew a circle on the ground. Washed it off and threw it at a wall as hard as I could. The wall dented, the orb is fine.\n\nI doubt this small stone is from our planet. It's so very, very durable, and I'll never be able to find out why it works the way it does. The 'why' no longer matters.\n\nThe 'what' does. What does it do. It runs in a circle on its own. It speeds up the tighter its path is constricted. The ring will be small and the energy it will produce will be enough.\n\nI washed the orb of the chalky dust and drew a map of the globe in the circle I'd drawn earlier.\n\n\n\nThe great marble we live on has some parallels with this little orb. Flecked with blue, spinning forever and ever without a care, in a perpetual circle.\n\n\n\nIt's almost ready.\n\n\n\nTwo months.\n\n\n\nJuly 9th\n\n\n\nRunning out of money. First test could be my last. I've asked the workers today to prepare for the undertaking of their lives, and that all the work we've done will pay off within twenty four hours.\n\nThe faint of heart left after that speech. Only a dozen, two dozen perhaps remain.\n\n\n\nGod see me through this.\n\nI'm scared out of my mind, and I'm worried I may not survive the next twenty four hours. The orb's capabilities are largely untouched. George has warned the local police, and they're blocking off a five mile radius around the already isolated laboratory. Tomorrow, I make history.\n\n\n\nJuly 10th\n\n\n\nThe forest has been destroyed. The lab is on fire. The tower was too focused. The electricity shot up the tower and was focused in such a way that it punched through the atmosphere in an arc-like beam of light. It vaporized seventeen men that were too close. I miscalculated everything. The shock wave knocked everything not bolted down off of its feet and set fire to the forest that wasn't knocked down. Some of the men are deafened and blinded. Word is from my associates overseas that they've detected the precise distance the beam traveled.\n\n\n\nIt burned a crack into the face of the planet Mars.\n\n\n\nGod forgive me for what I've done.\n\n\n\nI never meant for this. I wanted to help humanity.\n\n\n\nMen have arrived to douse the flames. They've taken the orb.\n\n\n\nGod forgive me.\n\n\n\nI never wanted this.\n\n[The remainder of the page has been smeared with tears.]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[!-- N/A (No Images)\u00a0\u00a0--]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "licensing-guide", "licensing-master-list"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "featured", "tale"], "title": "The Orb is the Key - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-orb-is-the-key", "year": 2011}, "the-other-side": {"created_at": "2011-12-12T17:04:00", "creator": "minmin", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "minmin", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/minmin", "comment": "", "date": "2011-12-12T17:04:00"}, {"author": "minmin", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/minmin", "comment": "italics", "date": "2011-12-13T05:40:00"}, {"author": "minmin", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/minmin", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

Heckle exited the alleyway, face-first into the acrid street smoke. He was not a very well-dressed man, though he held a distinct noble air around him, one that sent flies spiralling over his head and rats scurrying under dumpsters in shame when he coughed, throat smarting at the smog. But it was not the rats and flies and smog that occupied Rufus's mind as he approached the corner of 3rd and King's. It was the words the youngster had said at their last meeting three days ago, the cryptic \"final message before death\" every detective inevitably faces once or twice in his career. <em>The Other Side is always just around the corner.</em></p>\n<p><em>It's a cafe, an inn, a safehouse, though not in the usual sense</em>, the youngster had said. <em>They say it's a very important place, the kind where the guy you're looking for might frequent.</em> Rufus might have mentioned something about his job being very unlike the \"usual sense\", but let him continue. The youngster had nothing much left to say, though, and forty-six hours later his roommate found his set of clothes heaped over his shoes, at the start of a large bloody smear ending abruptly at the east window. It was the same window that, from two stories above, overlooked Rufus as he trod round the corner store, pausing only to scoop a handful of large pebbles from the sidewalk. \"The Other Side is always just around the corner,\" he mouthed, like a forgotten nursery rhyme. \"Just around the corner.\"</p>\n<p>One, two. Three, four. As if in a dream, he dropped them almost ritualistically as he rounded the block into the back alley, two before the corner, two after the corner. Crunch the gravel. Cough at the smoke from the street. There seemed to be a certain rhythm to it. <em>I am doing this. Why am I doing this?</em> He didn't even know if he was thinking anymore, the second round around the block nothing but a deep revenant calling from an ancient OCD. Corner store, here come the pebbles. One, two. <em>Tie my shoe.</em> Like a forgotten nursery rhyme. Three, four, knock on the door, and sure enough there at the side of the building was a pair of clear glass doors, tucked in low like the one from Alice in Wonderland. It even seemed just as small, cowering from the world in its cosy brick cubbyhole, and Rufus subconsciously stooped as he went through it. Above him, \"The Other Side Cafe\" hung daintily in embossed italics from velvety rope.</p>\n<p>It was an elegant affair, with glowing orbs keeping sentinel along the walls. Gas lamps? In this day and age? The checkerboard floor was odd too, shining like marble yet creaking like old wood when stepped on. Around him, patrons dined and drank, occasionally flickering (what?) like Chinese mask performers to reveal\u2026something. Whatever it was, it left him with the strange mental image of a pale shell-less crab in the moonlight, grotesque yet familiar. The whole place was\u2026how would he put it? Otherworldly.</p>\n<p>There was a two-seater near the corner, below a warm orb-light, and a genteel middle-aged man was sitting at it. There seemed to be something innately <em>different</em> about him, something that stood out, yet did not stand out from the contours of his face to the shapes of his shoes. Rufus immediately made a mental note of his appearance, and to his suprise found that he couldn't. Sure, the gentleman was probably forty-ish, with the look of a chap one'd probably find on a park bench feeding pidgeons somewhere. His attire did not just reek of \"drab\", it utterly defined it. It kept in the quiet of its seams, like the one guy at the party, the diplomatic one who never talked too much to anybody, and it was perfectly boring, even indescribable in its inanity. That was it. The drab man in the chair, the boringly impossible, impossibly boring man, he defied description, and he expected Rufus to sit down with him. No words, no signals. Just an expectation.</p>\n<p>\"I suppose you know why I'm here?\" said Rufus as he sidled in smoothly, though it was an empty assertion of power, a perfectly scripted line from an old noir movie.</p>\n<p><em>You're dealing with events way over your head here, kiddo. Best you stay out of this.</em> said the impossible man. Except he didn't say it like that, he said instead, \"Yes.\"</p>\n<p>Extending a hand (perfectly indescribable, thought Rufus), he greeted. \"I'm the Proprietor.\" Even the way he said it sounded capital. \"I hear about things from the patrons here and there, and I couldn't help but expect your arrival. Yves must have told you about the place.\"</p>\n<p>Rufus took his hand. \"I'm Ryan Gore.\" Carefully chosen alias here, though deep inside he knew it wouldn't hide a thing from this oddly dull man. \"Yves, that was his name? The kid who got killed?\"</p>\n<p>\"Killed? Hardly, though I can imagine he wish he were, Mister Rufus.\"</p>\n<p>They were both silent for a moment, as a maid in a gas mask passed by with tea. <em>Need a cup, sweetie?</em> she breathed. \"No milk, one sugar, Rosie,\" said the Proprietor. Rufus merely smiled and waved no, thanks. Rosie the gas mask maid might have smiled back, and she set down a steaming teacup from her tray before giving a curt nod to the Proprietor and moving on.</p>\n<p>\"So, what about the other cases? The gypsy woman on the twenty-second, the park vagrant on the twenty-fifth, what happened to them?\" implored Rufus.</p>\n<p>\"Same as the kid. What did you expect?\"</p>\n<p>\"Who killed\u2026took them?\"</p>\n<p>\"Can't say for sure. Lots of people come and go through the Other Side, and it gets hard to keep track of who entered where from here. This is where the lines get thin, after all. I built this establishment on a rift, Mister Rufus, and it bleeds onto people, leaves a stain. If you're looking for the guy who took those people, following those stains would be very helpful indeed. Given the nature of the crimes, wouldn't you say he'd continue hunting round the same neighbourhood?\" Proprietor took a long sip of his coffee.</p>\n<p>\"Aha. Typical serial killer. How do you suppose I find this\u2026stain?\"</p>\n<p>\"Why, just look at the patrons around you, Mister Rufus. Hell, there's even one trailing down your neck as we speak.\"</p>\n<p>Rufus glanced at his reflection on the immaculate checkerboard floor. Sure enough, a muddy streak was running from the end of his left ear down to the collarbone, looking more like a birthmark than anything now.

Heckle exited the alleyway, face-first into the acrid street smoke. He was not a very well-dressed man, though he held a distinct noble air around him, one that sent flies spiralling over his head and rats scurrying under dumpsters in shame when he coughed, throat smarting at the smog. But it was not the rats and flies and smog that occupied Rufus's mind as he approached the corner of 3rd and King's. It was the words the youngster had said at their last meeting three days ago, the cryptic \"final message before death\" every detective inevitably faces once or twice in his career. //The Other Side is always just around the corner.//\n\n\u00a0\n\n//It's a cafe, an inn, a safehouse, though not in the usual sense//, the youngster had said. //They say it's a very important place, the kind where the guy you're looking for might frequent.// Rufus might have mentioned something about his job being very unlike the \"usual sense\", but let him continue. The youngster had nothing much left to say, though, and forty-six hours later his roommate found his set of clothes heaped over his shoes, at the start of a large bloody smear ending abruptly at the east window. It was the same window that, from two stories above, overlooked Rufus as he trod round the corner store, pausing only to scoop a handful of large pebbles from the sidewalk. \"The Other Side is always just around the corner,\" he mouthed, like a forgotten nursery rhyme. \"Just around the corner.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nOne, two. Three, four. As if in a dream, he dropped them almost ritualistically as he rounded the block into the back alley, two before the corner, two after the corner. Crunch the gravel. Cough at the smoke from the street. There seemed to be a certain rhythm to it. //I am doing this. Why am I doing this?//\u00a0\u00a0He didn't even know if he was thinking anymore, the second round around the block nothing but a deep revenant calling from an ancient OCD. Corner store, here come the pebbles. One, two. //Tie my shoe.// Like a forgotten nursery rhyme. Three, four, knock on the door, and sure enough there at the side of the building was a pair of clear glass doors, tucked in low like the one from Alice in Wonderland. It even seemed just as small, cowering from the world in its cosy brick cubbyhole, and Rufus subconsciously stooped as he went through it. Above him, \"The Other Side Cafe\" hung daintily in embossed italics from velvety rope.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt was an elegant affair, with glowing orbs keeping sentinel along the walls. Gas lamps? In this day and age? The checkerboard floor was odd too, shining like marble yet creaking like old wood when stepped on. Around him, patrons dined and drank, occasionally flickering (what?) like Chinese mask performers to reveal...something. Whatever it was, it left him with the strange mental image of a pale shell-less crab in the moonlight, grotesque yet familiar. The whole place was...how would he put it? Otherworldly.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere was a two-seater near the corner, below a warm orb-light, and a genteel middle-aged man was sitting at it. There seemed to be something innately //different// about him, something that stood out, yet did not stand out from the contours of his face to the shapes of his shoes. Rufus immediately made a mental note of his appearance, and to his suprise found that he couldn't. Sure, the gentleman was probably forty-ish, with the look of a chap one'd probably find on a park bench feeding pidgeons somewhere. His attire did not just reek of \"drab\", it utterly defined it. It kept in the quiet of its seams, like the one guy at the party, the diplomatic one who never talked too much to anybody, and it was perfectly boring, even indescribable in its inanity. That was it. The drab man in the chair, the boringly impossible, impossibly boring man, he defied description, and he expected Rufus to sit down with him. No words, no signals. Just an expectation.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"I suppose you know why I'm here?\" said Rufus as he sidled in smoothly, though it was an empty assertion of power, a perfectly scripted line from an old noir movie.\n\n\u00a0\n\n//You're dealing with events way over your head here, kiddo. Best you stay out of this.// said the impossible man. Except he didn't say it like that, he said instead, \"Yes.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nExtending a hand (perfectly indescribable, thought Rufus), he greeted. \"I'm the Proprietor.\" Even the way he said it sounded capital. \"I hear about things from the patrons here and there, and I couldn't help but expect your arrival. Yves must have told you about the place.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nRufus took his hand. \"I'm Ryan Gore.\" Carefully chosen alias here, though deep inside he knew it wouldn't hide a thing from this oddly dull man. \"Yves, that was his name? The kid who got killed?\"\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Killed? Hardly, though I can imagine he wish he were, Mister Rufus.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey were both silent for a moment, as a maid in a gas mask passed by with tea. //Need a cup, sweetie?// she breathed. \"No milk, one sugar, Rosie,\" said the Proprietor. Rufus merely smiled and waved no, thanks. Rosie the gas mask maid might have smiled back, and she set down a steaming teacup from her tray before giving a curt nod to the Proprietor and moving on.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"So, what about the other cases? The gypsy woman on the twenty-second, the park vagrant on the twenty-fifth, what happened to them?\" implored Rufus.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Same as the kid. What did you expect?\"\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Who killed...took them?\"\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Can't say for sure. Lots of people come and go through the Other Side, and it gets hard to keep track of who entered where from here. This is where the lines get thin, after all. I built this establishment on a rift, Mister Rufus, and it bleeds onto people, leaves a stain. If you're looking for the guy who took those people, following those stains would be very helpful indeed. Given the nature of the crimes, wouldn't you say he'd continue hunting round the same neighbourhood?\" Proprietor took a long sip of his coffee.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Aha. Typical serial killer. How do you suppose I find this...stain?\"\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Why, just look at the patrons around you, Mister Rufus. Hell, there's even one trailing down your neck as we speak.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nRufus glanced at his reflection on the immaculate checkerboard floor. Sure enough, a muddy streak was running from the end of his left ear down to the collarbone, looking more like a birthmark than anything now. He scratched at it almost instinctively.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Well, there you go. It's been nice talking to you, Mister Rufus, but sadly that's all the help I can afford to give to a stranger. Goodbye.\" The Proprietor might have smiled a bit here.\n\n\n\n\"Thank you for the help.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"Oh, there's no reason to thank me,\" said Proprietor. \"Trust me. There won't be any.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nRufus Heckle got up, tucked his chair in, and headed for the door before deciding to ignore the last bit. He was a detective, for what it was worth, and by God if he didn't do what he was paid to do. //Good day to you, sir//, breathed a maid as she held the door open for him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe exited the Other Side Cafe, breathing in the last fumes of warmth from within.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"And a good day it shall be,\" he proclaimed to no one in particular.

Agrippa kept reminding himself that the solstice had been three days prior, and the sun simply chose to fall sooner than in earlier months. But the feeling of menace these woods held for him never passed. Agrippa didn't like the woods. Most of his people, at least the other Class II's, usually didn't. Ari, his companion, liked it less than Agrippa did.</p>\n<p>Ari never slowed down, though. Agrippa couldn't tell what he was thinking, as per usual. Ari was always the headstrong type, even back in the creches. It was a small act of the gods that he was never thrown out and stuck in some Class III pod to spend the rest of his life drooling and building roads. Maybe if the creche had had a different headmistress, he would have been, but Professor Allgrass wasn't about to let Ari get the best of her. For all that Ari was unspeakably stupid, he was undeniably brilliant. He matriculated at the bottom of the legion (Agrippa didn't come out much higher), but he made it. Two centurions, born and bred to Advance the Greater Reason. Agrippa chuckled and spat.</p>\n<p>\"What's so funny now?\" Ari asked.</p>\n<p>\"You, coming out of the best plutoborn creche in all of Sylvanos, and can't help getting lost in the woods.\"</p>\n<p>\"We're not lost. We're looking for someone who generally mislikes being found.\"</p>\n<p>\"If the Integrators get to him first, you know what happens to us, right?\" Agrippa asked. \"You know what happens to the movement if we lose the Woodsman?\"</p>\n<p>\"The Woodsman's not the primary goal, though,\" Ari said.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, you've been hinting at that,\" Agrippa said. \"He has some kind of weapon, right? Something from the other world?\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, there's no way of knowing,\" Ari said, \"but that's what we're told, and Milephanes himself wouldn't have asked us out here without good cause.\" Both Ari and Agrippa preened a bit at that; Milephanes was starting to be something of a folk hero, even among those outside the Movement, and <em>they</em> were his chosen instrument for this mission.</p>\n<p>\"Of course not. Whatever it is, the NatPhi kids at Alexylva want it, so it has to be valuable,\" Agrippa said. \"But what I'm saying is, do you know what happens if the Integrators find us before we find it?\"</p>\n<p>\"You mean, we'll get a medal?\"</p>\n<p>\"Ari, we'll get the black bile scraped out of our brains, be thrown in front of a target, and be used for practice by our old classmates. The ones you used to love to humiliate, remember?\"</p>\n<p>\"They humiliated themselves. I just pointed it out more than they liked.\"</p>\n<p>Agrippa wasn't in the mood to banter. He heard a sound just over the next hill. He stopped Ari and signaled to him that they should take cover. The two men split up and took positions behind trees, ten yards apart, and became completely silent. They watched the hillside, and waited.</p>\n<p>Integrators. Four soldiers, surgically augmented to be more machine than human. Forget the Braincaps; Agrippa has seen the schematics for all the technology stuck inside these men. Not even men, anymore; sexual organs removed, gender identity (along with every other mission-irrelevant thought) wiped. They moved with the speed of insects attacking an enemy anthill. Two of them were even walking on all fours, catlike. Agrippa had heard rumors that they could see in infrared, that they could hear human blood from inside the body, that they could smell souls. <em>But you can never believe the propaganda those University kids throw out,</em> he thought. The Integrators passed by without looking.</p>\n<p>Even Ari's implacable smile was gone for a minute. \"We have to hurry.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah. Which way?\"</p>\n<p>\"Follow me.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The Red Woodsman's hut (<em>hovel's more like it,</em> Agrippa thought) lay some ways away from where the Integrators had been heading, the only factor that gave the two any comfort under the circumstances. Ari snuck up to the door and rapped out a pre-arranged code while Agrippa stood watch. When the door creaked open, Ari waved Agrippa forward, then ducked inside. Agrippa hurried over and closed the door behind him.</p>\n<p>The smell was even worse than Agrippa had imagined. Whatever food the Woodsman had been living on for so long, he was apparently a little less demanding about its freshness. The stench of rotten meat filled the single room, and Agrippa was glad that the only window was blocked off. Not that the candlelight was helping much.</p>\n<p>The Woodsman was old, very old. Much older than Agrippa had imagined, judging from the ancient gaze in his pupilless eyes. Ari acted nonplussed, but it was clear he was surprised. They had hoped to find the legendary hermit, hoped he would be able to lead them in their uprising. They had talked to some of the other Guardians in their legion, even a couple of Class I University students. They all agreed that there was only one person who might have the knowledge on how to bring down their government, and certainly one such as the Woodsman would have motive enough. The Woodsman was the last of his people. Now it was clear that he wasn't going to last much longer either.</p>\n<p>\"Welcome, white devils,\" the Woodsman said. \"I trust your trip was\u2026uneventful?\" He turned and stumbled towards a small mound that was clearly his principal furniture in the shack, waving a thin branch on the ground to feel his way through the room.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, sir, very peaceful, sir,\" Ari said. Odd how he never spoke that way to his own commanders.</p>\n<p>The Woodsman's cracked face smiled slightly. \"Who's the other? You said someone was here, and he's breathing loud enough I'm afraid he'll die before I do.\"</p>\n<p>Ari chuckled nervously. Agrippa said in a shaky voice, \"The name's Agrippa Widewater, sir. Friend of Aristotle's. He's spoken of you.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, this devil mentioned you to me as well.\" The Woodsman's blank eyes seemed to fix on Agrippa's as he smiled.</p>\n<p>Agrippa cleared his throat. \"Um\u2026devil?\"</p>\n<p>The Woodsman registered no surprise. \"Yes, devil. White devil. I work with Aristotle here because he is less stupid than his countrymen, and with you because of his word that I should. But your people disgust me.\" He leaned forward as he spoke. \"I may well be the last of my people. Do you know of my people?\"</p>\n<p>Agrippa shook his head, then realized his mistake and said, \"No, no, I'm afraid not. The forest people?\"</p>\n<p>The Woodsman snorted. \"Gods, no. Do you know nothing of your history?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, certainly. We came to this land many hundreds of years ago and found your kind here. We tried to bring you into our Empire, but our diseases wiped most of you out\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"Let me stop you before you embarrass yourself further,\" the Woodsman said, no longer smiling. \"The white barbarians that spawned you came to this land, and found <em>my</em> people's red barbarian neighbors. The desert dwellers in the south, the snow people of the north, the grasseaters of the east. Many of us died of your sicknesses, yes, but our towns lived on. We allied with your people as you killed our enemies, then ran as you slaughtered us for our land. You stole our words, our medicines\u2014<em>I</em> likely enough had kin named Widewater, back when I had kin\u2014and then shoved us around the continent like marbles.</p>\n<p>\"<em>My</em> people were the people of the cave country, the Tsalagi. Our homes were east of here; you ground us out like burning embers. I am Adahy, and I may be the last of my people, and I may not; I have no way of knowing. My eyes are gone, and I shall die soon, but I have one gift to pass on, and the only ones\u2014\" The Woodsman paused at this last part \"\u2014the only ones I have to pass that gift to are two white devils. I will give you this gift from the world beyond this one, but let an old man have his regrets.\"</p>\n<p>Agrippa had no response to any of this. Ari, smart little beast that he was, rose to his feet and fell to one knee before the blind hermit. \"And let me pledge, sir, the enduring thanks of the better world your gift will bring about.\"</p>\n<p>The Woodsman seemed sated. \"Better for someone, anyway. Very well, I suppose you should be getting on, then. The box is on that little shelf there, beside the door.\" He pointed at a small brown box, oddly out of place in some imperceptible way; Agrippa had noticed it immediately upon entering. Something about the box's construction reeked of the unnatural. He walked across the room and picked it up.</p>\n<p>\"You may leave as soon as is prudent, travelers,\" Adahy said, and retreated to a small alcove.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Ari and Agrippa had run for what seemed like hours before they reached the end of the woodline and approached their barracks. They snuck into the building, nodding at the guard they had already bribed into silence. Of course, he likely thought they were just out fondling some <em>p\u00f3rnoi</em> in the pleasure district; the question wasn't asked, so long as the gold was forthcoming. The package was hidden until Ari pulled it out from under his tunic. They looked at the artifact, awe-filled in spite of its obvious cheap construction. Of course, the Phitransimun Combine wasn't known for its craftsmanship for most of its postal service; only high-grade objects were treated with real care. And this was clearly a postal container of some sort; the label was recognizable, the alphabet somewhat decipherable, even if neither Ari nor Agrippa knew where anyplace was called \"Omaha.\"</p>\n<p>Agrippa tried to gingerly pry open the wood-pulp container, but the adherent holding the flaps in place caused part of it to rip. Ari took the box from his hands and pulled the rest of the pulp apart. \"The covering isn't important; it's what's inside that counts.\"</p>\n<p>Working his way through the pulp coverings and the endless layers of clear, elastic paper air pockets used for padding (<em>what</em> amazing <em>skills these outworlders have,</em> Agrippa thought, as he gathered up the scraps falling from Ari's hands), Ari uncovered a small booklet.</p>\n<p>\"Wait, where's the weapon?\" Agrippa said.</p>\n<p>Ari flipped through the pages. \"I have no idea. But maybe Milephanes will.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The booklet that was brought to Milephanes was never translated into the language of their people, but Milephanes had learned how to read the offworlders' speech well enough by this point. He knew that the phrase \"UNITED STATES\" was important immediately; that was an important empire in the other-realm, and powerful. And while it took some research to learn what \"CONSTITUTION\" meant in this sense, he immediately took great interest in the concept of a \"DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<blockquote>\n<p>COMMUNIQUE<br/>\nFROM AGENT \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (\"PROFESSOR ALPHA\" , MTF P-1)<br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">TO RESEARCHER ESKOBAR<br/>\nHEAD OF RESEARCH<br/>\nALEXYLVA UNIVERSITY</span><br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">FWD: TO SENIOR RESEARCHER \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588<br/>\nSITE 38 DIRECTOR</span><br/>\nFWD: TO OVERWATCH COMMAND</p>\n<p>PRIORITY TWO ALERT</p>\n<p>TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:</p>\n<p>ANOMALOUS OBJECT ACQUIRED AT \u2588\u2588\u00b0 \u2588\u2588.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588' N \u2588\u2588\u00b0 \u2588\u2588.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 W AT 0330 THIS DAY.

And while it took some research to learn what \"CONSTITUTION\" meant in this sense, he immediately took great interest in the concept of a \"DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.\"\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n> COMMUNIQUE\n\n> FROM AGENT \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (\"PROFESSOR ALPHA\" , MTF P-1)\n\n> --TO RESEARCHER ESKOBAR\n\n> HEAD OF RESEARCH\n\n> ALEXYLVA UNIVERSITY-- \n\n> --FWD: TO SENIOR RESEARCHER \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n> SITE 38 DIRECTOR--\n\n> FWD: TO OVERWATCH COMMAND\n\n> \n\n> PRIORITY TWO ALERT \n\n> \n\n> TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:\n\n> \n\n> ANOMALOUS OBJECT ACQUIRED AT \u2588\u2588\u00b0 \u2588\u2588.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588' N \u2588\u2588\u00b0 \u2588\u2588.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 W AT 0330 THIS DAY.

Governments are instituted among men with power given to be from the will of those men, and when any ruler seeks to defy that will, it is to those men to see that ruler's blood spilled from sea to sea, and to choose new ruler to make men safe and [pleased?]\"\n\n> \n\n> --------\n\n> \n\n> \"The history of current Regent of Novomundus tells to us that he is such ruler and cannot be suffered for further living.

He was known to be the best at his art, and his fingers moved like rippling water, manipulating even the finest of fibre and thread into intricate lines of motion that, so the story goes, could bring tapestry to life. Now, we know little truth in that fact. But the thing everyone agrees on is that one day, the tailor sighed.</p>\n<p>For he had grown old over the years, and his hands were no longer the systematic swift swirling of small ripples, but the choppy churning of deep lakes. As always, his finished products were magnificent in detail and his commissions rolled in, but there lacked the spark, the swift precision that was his hallmark and pride and joy in his early days.</p>\n<p>So the master tailor decided to search for an apprentice. Notices were put up, word was spread, and soon hopeful pupils by the coachload were hiking up the path to the master tailor's cottage, which was secluded so as to aid his concentration on his work. The tailor welcomed his candidates with open arms, and directed them each to a private room where they were shown a needle and as much as they required of the tailor's finest thread. Thinner than a horsehair and flimsier than rotten flax but shining silver which seemed to animate in the cold winter light. The task was to weave a single sheet of shimmering, moving silver, which could not be broken by human means. The tailor could accomplish this with ease, and even demonstrated it in front of the rapt students-to-be.</p>\n<p>Naturally, many forfeited after testing the thread, and though there were some who came close, with a twist and a snap, their hard work would come undone by the stern-faced tailor. You have failed, he would say for the hundredth time that day, and the candidate would sigh, pack up and go.</p>\n<p>Now this continued for a week, but among the many hopefuls, none were able to replicate what the tailor had taken years to learn and even longer to master. As he showed another dejected candidate through the door, he thought to himself. \"I can weave shimmering dragons, flying through the moving tapestry sky; I can weave live fire-flies with their glowing dances onto impossible textures of coats. If I cannot find a man worthy enough to be my student, I shall weave one myself! For nothing knows the fine flow of needle and thread better than one made of needle and thread himself.\"</p>\n<p>The next day, the tailor locked his gate and blocked out his windows. Taking a bundle of fine white cotton, he began to weave. In and out, through holes impossible to find and even harder to thread, into three dimensions he constructed a matrix of interwoven thread, and with a final tuck completed a solid bone out of impossibly locked cotton. More and more he sewed, until a complete man's frame was formed. Then he bounded to the frame, by way of hooks and needles, countless numbers of springy red fibres, dyed with the blood of goats and bewitched by an old gypsy he once met in his earlier days. Slowly, the woven muscles twisted and snaked round one another until they stretched taut on the white cotton bone, and twitched with excited tension. But the tailor pressed his hand to the jumpy threads and said, \"Lie still. It's not time yet.\"</p>\n<p>With thin catgut he sewed infinitesimal compartments, until the structure resembled a human lung, and he placed it in the open quivering ribcage. In several swift movements of his needle he connected dripping red thread to fleshy catgut and woven bone, and painfully but surely the muscles contracted. His creation took a shuddering, shallow first breath.</p>\n<p>For the veins and arteries he threaded numerous hollow yarns through the strands of interwoven red tendons, into linen bone and within breathing chest, and at the center of it all placed a little sewing-machine mechanism, driven by clockwork held fast with craftsman's glue and a live starpiece. Feeding silk through the heart, he wound up the pulsing starpiece, starting off the mechanism with a muted titter-tatter. Through the hollow veins life's silk coursed, bringing movement and vigour to the limbs. But there was yet no mind to control it, and the creation did not rise.</p>\n<p>Using a sheet of smooth pink silk, he stitched skin to muscle, covering the exposed rawness with a layer of thread so warm and smooth to the touch one could have mistaken it for a real person. With embellishments crafted from marble he slid fingernails into raw pulsing nailbeds, and teeth into dry gums. The hair was spun with the finest gold thread the tailor could afford, falling over clear glass eyes filled with bella-donna dew for sight. He left a small opening at the base of the skull, for he had not yet thought of how to weave a sentient soul.</p>\n<p>Finally, among his vaults of disused material he discovered a strange colourless spool of thread which somehow shimmered with light more than even his most delicate silver. It was fine, but somehow not too thin, and so strong that he needed a carving-knife to sever it, but felt in his hands and needle that in all his years of practice and self-training, this thread was spun for his talented fingers alone.</p>\n<p>In the pale moonlight he began to cast the thread into a single piece of textile. But the more he spun, the more he deviated and the needle twisted and turned, forwards and backwards into ways not even he could comprehend.

He was known to be the best at his art, and his fingers moved like rippling water, manipulating even the finest of fibre and thread into intricate lines of motion that, so the story goes, could bring tapestry to life. Now, we know little truth in that fact. But the thing everyone agrees on is that one day, the tailor sighed.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor he had grown old over the years, and his hands were no longer the systematic swift swirling of small ripples, but the choppy churning of deep lakes. As always, his finished products were magnificent in detail and his commissions rolled in, but there lacked the spark, the swift precision that was his hallmark and pride and joy in his early days.\n\n\n\nSo the master tailor decided to search for an apprentice. Notices were put up, word was spread, and soon hopeful pupils by the coachload were hiking up the path to the master tailor's cottage, which was secluded so as to aid his concentration on his work. The tailor welcomed his candidates with open arms, and directed them each to a private room where they were shown a needle and as much as they required of the tailor's finest thread. Thinner than a horsehair and flimsier than rotten flax but shining silver which seemed to animate in the cold winter light. The task was to weave a single sheet of shimmering, moving silver, which could not be broken by human means. The tailor could accomplish this with ease, and even demonstrated it in front of the rapt students-to-be.\n\n\n\nNaturally, many forfeited after testing the thread, and though there were some who came close, with a twist and a snap, their hard work would come undone by the stern-faced tailor. You have failed, he would say for the hundredth time that day, and the candidate would sigh, pack up and go.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow this continued for a week, but among the many hopefuls, none were able to replicate what the tailor had taken years to learn and even longer to master. As he showed another dejected candidate through the door, he thought to himself. \"I can weave shimmering dragons, flying through the moving tapestry sky; I can weave live fire-flies with their glowing dances onto impossible textures of coats. If I cannot find a man worthy enough to be my student, I shall weave one myself! For nothing knows the fine flow of needle and thread better than one made of needle and thread himself.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe next day, the tailor locked his gate and blocked out his windows. Taking a bundle of fine white cotton, he began to weave. In and out, through holes impossible to find and even harder to thread, into three dimensions he constructed a matrix of interwoven thread, and with a final tuck completed a solid bone out of impossibly locked cotton. More and more he sewed, until a complete man's frame was formed. Then he bounded to the frame, by way of hooks and needles, countless numbers of springy red fibres, dyed with the blood of goats and bewitched by an old gypsy he once met in his earlier days. Slowly, the woven muscles twisted and snaked round one another until they stretched taut on the white cotton bone, and twitched with excited tension. But the tailor pressed his hand to the jumpy threads and said, \"Lie still. It's not time yet.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nWith thin catgut he sewed infinitesimal compartments, until the structure resembled a human lung, and he placed it in the open quivering ribcage. In several swift movements of his needle he connected dripping red thread to fleshy catgut and woven bone, and painfully but surely the muscles contracted. His creation took a shuddering, shallow first breath.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor the veins and arteries he threaded numerous hollow yarns through the strands of interwoven red tendons, into linen bone and within breathing chest, and at the center of it all placed a little sewing-machine mechanism, driven by clockwork held fast with craftsman's glue and a live starpiece. Feeding silk through the heart, he wound up the pulsing starpiece, starting off the mechanism with a muted titter-tatter. Through the hollow veins life's silk coursed, bringing movement and vigour to the limbs. But there was yet no mind to control it, and the creation did not rise.\n\n\u00a0\n\nUsing a sheet of smooth pink silk, he stitched skin to muscle, covering the exposed rawness with a layer of thread so warm and smooth to the touch one could have mistaken it for a real person. With embellishments crafted from marble he slid fingernails into raw pulsing nailbeds, and teeth into dry gums. The hair was spun with the finest gold thread the tailor could afford, falling over clear glass eyes filled with bella-donna dew for sight. He left a small opening at the base of the skull, for he had not yet thought of how to weave a sentient soul.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFinally, among his vaults of disused material he discovered a strange colourless spool of thread which somehow shimmered with light more than even his most delicate silver. It was fine, but somehow not too thin, and so strong that he needed a carving-knife to sever it, but felt in his hands and needle that in all his years of practice and self-training, this thread was spun for his talented fingers alone.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn the pale moonlight he began to cast the thread into a single piece of textile. But the more he spun, the more he deviated and the needle twisted and turned, forwards and backwards into ways not even he could comprehend. It was as if the thread was compelling him, forcing his fingers into complex loops and maneuvers until he lost track of everything and all that remained was an indeterminate bundle in his hands, chaotic yet somehow orderly, which seemed to change its shape depending on from which angle he looked at it. His needle was also warped and bent double into a smooth curve, although he could not remember it doing so while he was sewing.\n\n\u00a0\n\nCarefully, gingerly, he lowered the strange dreamy bundle into the cavity of the skull, and stitched up the hole with a single movement. The glass eyes grew a little less opaque, and the tick-tick-tick of the clockwork heart quickened, and the woven man came to life.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThat was the story he told the townsfolk, as he brought the woven man to the market the next day. Silk pulsing through threaded veins, it spoke and breathed and acted like a human being. In fact, so engrossed was the master tailor at his project that he did not realise he had created the woven man entirely in his own image. The townsfolk were amazed, and expressed joy at the tailor having another hand to help about in the never-ending work and commissions.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe days went by, and soon enough the woven man grew to be as proficient as the master tailor was in his prime.

In that second, the man had appeared as a vulpine demon, snarling in the falling rain. It was an appropriate image for Sir Clef, the last on the Light Knights that opposed the appointment of Jack Bright, Lord of Spite, the previous High War-Lich of the Schips Foundation, a group of American wizards whose original purpose had been twisted by his evil.</p>\n<p>Sir Clef, originally stationed in the British quadrant, was now investigating the fall of the Schips due to one particularly meddlesome little wizard: Harry Potter.</p>\n<p>Since Harry had perfected the Life Spell, a magic capable of returning those dead to life, so long as they weren\u2019t gay, he had brought back many of those slain by Voldemort, including Albus Dumbledore. The two of them had raided Schips, the group responsible for the protection of the United States\u2019 most valuable magical artifacts. Before Bright\u2019s dark, venomous hands closed on the neck of the wizarding group, it had been mostly passive, and after his death, it was pretty much unevil again. Though, there were still loose ends to tie up. It was a dirty, difficult job\u2014and only the dirtiest and most difficult were asked to do it. And no one was more difficult and dirty than Sir Clef.</p>\n<p>But there was a problem. The young wizard had stolen back the American Chosen One, his sister, and taken her back with him to Britain. Sir Clef had no choice. He had to get her back; his Lord and Master demanded it.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo be it,\u201d he thought.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Clef entered the bleak chamber of the Schips greatest prisoner: Threfor Threed, the Demon Warlock. He drew his black broadsword\u2014Ookoolayla, the Song Ender\u2014and stood before the beast, prepared to strike him down.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Sir Clef,\u201d the gnarled old man spoke. \u201cYou\u2019ve come to me for the secrets of demonic power at last? I have such wonderful things to show you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSilence yourself, warlock,\u201d said Clef, glaring at his old, grizzled foe. \u201cYou will submit yourself to my authority, lest I smite thee.\u201d</p>\n<p>The demon consorter laughed, then looked at his ancient nemesis, glaring. \u201cSo be it, Clef,\u201d he muttered. \u201cReturn my wand, and I will help you recapture the chosen child. But mark me\u2014if I am betrayed, our bloods will mingle on the ground and water the thorns.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef spat. \u201cTemp me not, rapist of the pure souls,\u201d he said. \u201cDo as I command, and you shall have your freedom.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo be it,\u201d cackled the ancient man, his voice echoing through the cell like a death knee on the eve of a Winter\u2019s morn.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Sir Clef entered the man\u2019s cell; he had once been a trusted companion\u2026before his burning. Now, he was one of the few imprisoned by Schips willingly, for his ability for harm was far too great. He sat in his cell, the walls flaking with ashes.</p>\n<p>\u201cSir Gerald,\u201d said Clef, looking at his old companion. \u201cI needest thee, for by your power alone may I check the Giant Hagrid.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gerald looked at him. \u201cI am no longer a Sir,\u201d he said, mournfully and sadly. \u201cI am only Gerald. But I will help thee, Clef.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef looked at him. \u201cYou\u2019ll always be a sir to me,\u201d he said, bowing his head slightly to his cursed companion.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe go to recapture the chosen one?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Clef. \u201cMy master commands it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen so be it,\u201d said Gerald, his words sounding very familiar to the ending of the last section.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Clef stood on the beach at the Cliffs of Dover, staring through a magic portal. Suddenly, Harry, Dumbledore, and Hagrid strode through it, resplendent in their magical force and power. Harry looked at Clef imperiously, as everyone squared off against each other. It was so totally awesome looking.</p>\n<p>Then, they started fighting, each of them shouting \u201cSO BE IT!\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Threfor Threed stood across from Albus Dumbledore, both of the ancient powers hurling magics at each other.</p>\n<p>\u201cSTUPIFY!\u201d shouted Threfor Threed, directing his demonic forces through his wand\u2014made of demon horn and nightmare hair\u2014at Dumbledore.</p>\n<p>\u201cNEGATORY!\u201d responded Dumbledore, deflecting the magic. \u201cWhy, Threfor Threed? You were among the best of us? Why did you turn evil?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause!\u201d he shouted. \u201cI loved you Albus! I loved you, and you only gave me spite in return!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor the last time!\u201d Dumbledore said. \u201cI\u2019m totally not gay!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLIAR!\u201d shouted Threfor Threed, hurling deadly power.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo be it,\u201d said Dumbledore.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Gerald looked up at the giant, a grim smile frowning across his face. \u201cPlease, Giant. I do not wish to do this!\u201d</p>\n<p>Hagrid looked at him. \u201cI canna let ya take the girl,\u201d shouted Hagrid. \u201cShe\u2019s \u2018appy \u2018ere wit\u2019 us!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen you leave me no choice,\u201d said Gerald, activating his hidden power. He suddenly burst into flames, for when Gerald had been burned years ago, he was infected with lycanthropy, turning him into a Werepyre.</p>\n<p>His arms extended, his body ablaze as he screamed.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo be it,\u201d said Hagrid.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Clef drew his black blade, pacing around Harry. The other two were checked by his companions, and he had to defeat Harry quickly. Clef charged the young man, swinging wildly.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d shouted Harry. \u201cYou cannot have her!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut without her,\u201d said Clef, \u201cthe apocalypse will happen!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d said Harry, his wand reshaping into a blade of crimson and gold, the colors of his house. \u201cI will not allow you to take her.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo be it,\u201d said Clef.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Harry and Clef fought for a while, their blades bouncing off each other, sparks of power flying between them. Suddenly, Harry saw an opening, diving in to cut Clef\u2019s leg.</p>\n<p>\u201cOw!\u201d said Clef, dropping his blade and falling. \u201cMaster! I\u2019ve failed!\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry raised his sword to strike the killing blow, but it was stopped\u2014by a long, silver blade.</p>\n<p>Harry looked over, his jaw quivering slightly. \u201cD..d\u2026Darkblade!\u201d he shouted, jumping back.</p>\n<p>Darkblade stepped over Clef to guard him. \u201cYou tried, my servant,\u201d he said, protecting Clef. \u201cI will stop him now!\u201d</p>\n<p>Then, Harry and Darkblade started fighting, their blades clashing. Darkblade was holding back, for he knew Harry only had his sister\u2019s best intentions at heart, but he still defended himself.

And no one was more difficult and dirty than Sir Clef.\n\n\n\nBut there was a problem.\u00a0\u00a0The young wizard had stolen back the American Chosen One, his sister, and taken her back with him to Britain.\u00a0\u00a0Sir Clef had no choice.\u00a0\u00a0He had to get her back; his Lord and Master demanded it.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo be it,\u201d he thought.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nClef entered the bleak chamber of the Schips greatest prisoner: Threfor Threed, the Demon Warlock.\u00a0\u00a0He drew his black broadsword\u2014Ookoolayla, the Song Ender\u2014and stood before the beast, prepared to strike him down.\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, Sir Clef,\u201d the gnarled old man spoke. \u201cYou\u2019ve come to me for the secrets of demonic power at last?

Yes, this is theorized to be the current force behind the team designated 'Serpent's Hand'. It appears to be self-aware, however it is unknown if it exerts a form of mental dominance, or simply attracts fanatics. It also appears to be out of phase with normal timespace, hence our inability to pin down the location.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>click</em></p>\n<p>\u201cIt also appears that certain documents and items lapsed in to the public arena. With this-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are we looking at here? Is that Lydecker standing-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, it appears he underwent a\u2026'religious awakening' and attempted to seed a cult of worship. It fell through rather rapidly, thanks in a large part to our suppression efforts, however seeds of this ideology keep cropping up. The greatest of which appears to be rooted near Mexico City, however it is still relatively minor and centered around a decommissioned clockwork device. However, the fallout from the Serpent's Hand splintering lead to the founding of a more strict, focused team.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>click</em></p>\n<p>\u201cThese men and women were selected from various agencies worldwide. FBI, KGB, MI5, The Kempeitai, all were tapped for the cream of the crop, the top-class talents. This group was installed to control and suppress any and all anomalous item activity. They were instilled with a 'zero tolerance' stance to any and all paranormal interaction, in the hopes of avoiding the\u2026corruption issues presented by the former Serpent's Hand. However, after the first year, it became apparent that\u2026mistakes may have been made in the choice of recruitment stock.</p>\n<p><em>click</em></p>\n<p>\u201cOh god\u2026that was the august incident, wasn't it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, that's correct. After a year of operation, on August 19th, the Global Occult Coalition engaged in a armed action in south Africa that nearly destabilized the entire Veil protocol. No less than eight hundred witnesses observed both personnel and anomalous items in a prolonged armed action over several days. When probed for the reasoning behind this action, the GOC reported that they felt the risk to normalcy incurred by their action was less then that of the items. The incident was suppressed, with great cost, and the GOC was officially ordered to stand down.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>click</em></p>\n<p>\u201cHowever, many of the GOC cells felt that defense of humanity was now a calling above and beyond the conclave command structure. They went rogue, leaving this\u2026rather grim parting message. They now function much the same as their initial form, but with a independent command structure. The new GOC also lend support and command to several other, smaller groups with various political and anomalous interests.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, it could be worse, right? I mean, at least they didn't flip all the way over.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is somewhat true; however, their zero-tolerance stance has now led to the basic focus on the eradication of any and all anomalous items and activity. They have no review process, no real testing or research branch\u2026just detection, and eradication.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>click</em></p>\n<p>\u201cThat fat son of a-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd here we have our most recent failure. Colonel Marshall, who had been a original member of the GOC, was tapped to spearhead a new containment theory. This photo was taken shortly before the central records building was looted and burned, with Marshall vanishing at the same time. We may never know the full damage done, but it appears several items, along with the bulk of the documentation, have been stolen. It now also appears that he has found partners, and plans on utilizing his gains for financial advancement.</p>\n<p><em>click</em></p>\n<p>\u201cThis is Dr. Carter, his first partner. Not much is known of him yet, however he's been a major mover in London high society the last few years, and appears to have a near-limitless personal fortune.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>click</em></p>\n<p>\u201cW\u2026what are we looking at?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is Mr. Dark. We know next to nothing about this individual, and he has eluded any and all investigation. He has no citizenship, no birth records, on paper this man does not exist. We assume he is a man, however we have been unable to confirm even this. Based on some fragmentary records, he may have been in the entertainment industry at one point. His role in this venture is still unknown. Lights, please.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>small snapping noise, followed by several moments of silence, then rustling paper</em></p>\n<p>\u201cThese dossiers detail our current containment theory. It appears the American government has a embryonic containment team formed, and is investigating. We propose to fund and aid this group, and guide its direction and growth, with a eventual goal of autonomy. The major focus is on containment and detachment. Actual interaction outside of a containment area will be extremely limited, massive bureaucratic structure will keep individuals and separate cells well isolated, and enormous resources will limit outside interaction and oversight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis will take ages, you know that, right? Autonomy could take years in a best case scenario.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTrue, however it was determined that this was a minor price to pay. The overall detachment, isolation, and limited individual focus, along with the greatly subdivided command structure, will limit rogue and corruption events to a minimum.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026seems to be in order, but I have issue with the name.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cthe\u2026name, sir?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. 'The Special Containment Bureau' sounds too\u2026lofty. Give someone a lofty name, they start to have lofty ideals. This is for the safety and security of mankind, and reality as a whole. The name should reflect a sense of self-sacrifice and dedication.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026well\u2026sir, what would you advise, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSomething simple, obscure\u2026basic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026such as?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026how about\u2026The Foundation?\u201d</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/transcript-found-on-storage-level-b-8\">Transcript Found On Storage Level B 8</a>\" by Dr Gears, from the <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

To make sure that you didn\u2019t think there was a transcription error or something. Hank, can you start?</p>\n<p>KISSINGER \u2013 Case COLD HARPER. How you people come up with these names I don\u2019t know. These are the instructions to SAC if the balloon goes up on Case COLD HARPER. Here is the list of the bomber wings and the ICBM sites in the usual format and here are the coordinates of the target. You will \u2026</p>\n<p>MEYER \u2013 I don\u2019t understand, it\u2019s the same coordinates all the way down the list \u2026</p>\n<p>MOORER \u2013 Some of these assets, sir, Anderson AFB, uh, that's in Guam, and Clark is in the Philippines. How can they even reach \u2026</p>\n<p>MEYER \u2013 Hold it, yeah, you\u2019re right, Tom. What is this?</p>\n<p>HAIG \u2013 [unintelligible ] \u2026 if Case COLD HARPER goes hot \u2026</p>\n<p>NIXON \u2013 See, Hank, this is why I wanted them here in person. Admiral, general, this is not a mistake. If we have to call COLD HARPER, then, uh, then this location here is the target.</p>\n<p>MEYER \u2013 [unintelligible] \u2026 somewhere in the Arctic Ocean.</p>\n<p>MOORER \u2013 Seventy-three point such and such north by fifty four point such and such east. Let me check the map \u2026 It\u2019s not in the ocean, it's the big Russian island here, Novaya Zemlya.</p>\n<p>MEYER \u2013 \u2026 that fifty-megaton job that Khrushchev dropped back in sixty-one? Tsar Bomba I think they called it? I think that was where they dropped it.</p>\n<p>HAIG \u2013 \u2026 show you some U-2 photographs of the location.</p>\n<p>MEYER \u2013 So we would be bombing a test range? I don\u2019t \u2026</p>\n<p>KISSINGER \u2013 [unintelligible] \u2026 not exactly a testing facility.</p>\n<p>MOORER \u2013 I\u2019m sorry?</p>\n<p>KISSINGER \u2013 I said that it\u2019s not a testing facility. A garbage incinerator would be a better analogy. If you want to be technical, it\u2019s not even a Soviet facility, strictly speaking.</p>\n<p>SACHS \u2013 Dr. Kissinger, I don't think \u2026</p>\n<p>HAIG \u2013 Mr. President, I should point out that General Meyer isn\u2019t on the list, and Admiral Moorer \u2026</p>\n<p>NIXON \u2013 Al, they have to know enough to be able to do their jobs.</p>\n<p>HAIG \u2013 Sir, I agree of course but [unintelligible]</p>\n<p>MEYER \u2013 What list? Forgive me for not being in on the news that there\u2019s a clearance level that is higher than the Commander of Strategic Air Command, but that guy next to Dr. Kissinger who I don\u2019t even recognize \u2026</p>\n<p>NIXON \u2013 I\u2019m going to tell them \u2026</p>\n<p>HAIG \u2013 Mr. President, I really [unintelligible]</p>\n<p>NIXON \u2013 \u2026 no, not everything. Just what they need \u2026</p>\n<p>MOORER \u2013 [unintelligible] a little out of the loop \u2026</p>\n<p>NIXON \u2013 Admiral, General, it will have to suffice for me to say that there is a\u2026 there is an object, let\u2019s say, at this place on that island. These are contingency targeting instructions. If I \u2026 if the Commander in Chief, gives the command to activate COLD HARPER, which would only be done if Christ help us the trigger condition had been satisfied, then \u2026</p>\n<p>MEYER \u2013 \u2026 then that site becomes the priority target.</p>\n<p>NIXON \u2013 \u2026 the only target. It is not just the priority target, it\u2019s the only target.</p>\n<p>MOORER \u2013 Sir, you have us sending three, four, wait \u2026 all, all of our bomber wings, and \u2026 all of our intercontinental missiles \u2026</p>\n<p>KISSINGER \u2013 That\u2019s correct, Admiral \u2026</p>\n<p>MOORER \u2013 \u2026 targeting just this one location \u2026</p>\n<p>MEYER \u2013 Sir, the way we run our bombers, when we hit something once with these payloads, the target is gone, so I don\u2019t see \u2026</p>\n<p>MOORER \u2013 \u2026 not even LeMay would have \u2026 [unintelligible]</p>\n<p>MEYER \u2013 \u2026 [unintelligible] would have to be a one-way trip for a lot of these boys, at this range \u2026</p>\n<p>NIXON \u2013 Look, Tom, John, I'm satisfied that it\u2019s necessary.</p>\n<p>MOORER \u2013 Whoever is there, you must really want us to get up there in a hell of a hurry and kill it.</p>\n<p>HAIG \u2013 If it comes to that. I sure as hell hope not, since a lot of the guys up there are ours. Well, his, at any rate.</p>\n<p>MEYER \u2013 So who the hell are you guys, then?</p>\n<p>SACHS \u2013 We're keeping an eye on the \u2026 object, as the President put it, until we can come up with a satisfactory way to get rid of it.</p>\n<p>MOORER \u2013 So this is your plan for disposing of the \u2026 whatever it is?</p>\n<p>NIXON \u2013 This is Plan B. Plan A is just holding the line, so to speak, for as long as they can in the way that they're doing it now.</p>\n<p>MEYER \u2013 With respect, sir, I don\u2019t see how we can drill this, with everything that has to be put into place for Linebacker \u2026</p>\n<p>KISSINGER \u2013 General, first of all, it has been determined for the sake of operational security that the existence of COLD HARPER itself is Foxtrot-level from which it follows that there can be no drills. Nobody, not even SAC command staff, who have not been designated Foxtrot-level are cleared for this. If the balloon goes up, you just do what you have to do to aim your planes and target your missiles in accordance with these instructions. Secondly, if \u2026</p>\n<p>NIXON \u2013 Where Henry is going with this is that if we\u2019re in COLD HARPER, then fuck Linebacker, fuck South Vietnam, it isn\u2019t going to matter.</p>\n<p>MOORER \u2013 But we would no longer have our nuclear deterrence against the Soviets \u2026</p>\n<p>HAIG \u2013 It doesn\u2019t matter because they will have already \u2026</p>\n<p>NIXON \u2013 I should have told Al not to bother showing you those photos, because if we do COLD HARPER then the location isn\u2019t going to look like this by the time your boys get there, John. It will already be hot because the Russians, who are closer, obviously, will have already hit the location with everything that they\u2019ve got.</p>\n<p>MEYER \u2013 The Soviets would, uh, would bomb themselves?</p>\n<p>KISSINGER \u2013 Well, it was their own idea \u2026</p>\n<p>SACHS \u2013 Technically, they\u2019d be bombing my people, but under the circumstances that would hardly matter.</p>\n<p>MEYER \u2013 I have to ask because I really don\u2019t know the answer. You\u2019re on our side, right? I mean, you\u2019re not a Russian or \u2026</p>\n<p>SACHS \u2013 Athens, Georgia sir. Go Bulldogs.</p>\n<p>MEYER \u2013 This whole thing just doesn\u2019t make any damn sense \u2026</p>\n<p>MOORER \u2014 We would hit this thing with our whole nuclear triad after it's already nothing but a smoking irradiated crater from what the Soviets have?</p>\n<p>KISSINGER \u2013 Not the whole triad, Admiral. Just the missiles and bombers. The subs \u2026</p>\n<p>NIXON \u2013 The boomers we will need for Noah, which I'll go over with you and Elmo Zumwalt in another briefing in a few days.</p>\n<p>MEYER \u2013 NOAA as in the weather forecasting people?</p>\n<p>KISSINGER \u2013 Noah as in ark. Don't you remember from Sunday School? The animals march in, two by two \u2026</p>\n<p>HAIG \u2013 [unintelligible] \u2026seeds and frozen embryos, for the most part \u2026 [unintelligible] \u2026 offload the missiles to make room \u2026</p>\n<p>NIXON \u2013 We\u2019re not ready to talk about Noah yet. I want to get this targeting thing settled. Admiral Moorer, General Meyer, I assure you that I have thought this through. General, you have the order. Thank you both for coming.</p>\n<p>MOORER \u2013 Thank you, Mr. President. [ADM. MOORER AND GEN. MEYER LEAVE THE MEETING.]</p>\n<p>NIXON \u2013 That settles that bit. Satisfied, Agent Sachs?</p>\n<p>SACHS \u2013 Yes, Mr. President. I\u2019ll report back to the \u2026 [unintelligible]</p>\n<p>NIXON \u2013 Yes, thank you for coming. Please tell your people \u2026 tell them that I appreciate the fine work they\u2019re doing.</p>\n<p>SACHS \u2013 Of course, sir. Thank you, Mr. President. [AGENT SACHS LEAVES THE MEETING]</p>\n<p>NIXON \u2013 Thanks, Al. Can Henry and I have the room?</p>\n<p>HAIG \u2013 Yes sir, Mr. President. [GENERAL HAIG LEAVES THE MEETING]</p>\n<p>NIXON \u2013 Should we get Ambassador Dobrynin over here to tell him? Or do you want to talk to Gromyko directly?</p>\n<p>KISSINGER \u2013 I\u2019ll call Gromyko. I\u2019ll call him as soon as I get back over to the Executive Office Building.</p>\n<p>NIXON \u2013 Our boys here \u2026 Henry, it wears on you, how they don\u2019t see the big picture.</p>\n<p>KISSINGER \u2013 To be fair, Mr. President, apart from the GOC and Foxtrot, and whatever the Soviets call their version of Foxtrot, they don\u2019t know \u2026</p>\n<p>NIXON \u2013 They don\u2019t know. And it makes you kind of jealous.</p>\n<p>KISSINGER \u2013 When you had told me, I didn\u2019t really appreciate it. I didn\u2019t, until Sachs and Marshal Yakubovsky took me up there last week and showed me\u2026</p>\n<p>NIXON \u2013 I\u2019m afraid that it will stay with you \u2026</p>\n<p>KISSINGER \u2013 [unintelligible] \u2026 not believe it. Even after the number of times they\u2019ve dropped bombs on it. Even the Tsar Bomba barely \u2026 [unintelligible]</p>\n<p>NIXON \u2013 \u2026 including those times in '64 and '65 when Johnson had to give them some of our bombs to use because they had run out of their own \u2026</p>\n<p>KISSINGER \u2013 \u2026 [unintelligible] still see it every time I close my eyes.</p>\n<p>NIXON \u2013 They brought me up there and showed it to me when I went to Russia under Ike in 1959. This was a couple of days after the Kitchen Debate. \u2026 Ike knew, I'm certain of it. He asked me to go over there. I guess he wanted to see whether I was ready. Hand me the whiskey?</p>\n<p>KISSINGER \u2013 Let me pour us each one.</p>\n<p>NIXON \u2013 [laughs] I'm going to need a taller one than that, uh, just give me the bottle back. You know, I didn\u2019t even use to drink very much before that trip. But you do what it takes and you soldier on \u2026</p>\n<p>KISSINGER \u2013 Those men at the site, they have to be there every day.</p>\n<p>NIXON \u2013 [unintelligible] \u2026 the god-damn bravest bastards in the whole world. Especially that guy, uh, Vassily, with the eyepatch. Was he still there?</p>\n<p>KISSINGER \u2013 You had told me, and I asked about him. They told me that he\u2019s still on the books as being assigned there, but they keep him sedated most of the time.</p>\n<p>NIXON \u2013 That\u2019s a shame. They told me that he had been through Stalingrad, and Berlin, but I can\u2019t \u2026 I don\u2019t think I\u2019m surprised.</p>\n<p>KISSINGER \u2013 [unintelligible]</p>\n<p>NIXON \u2013 You know, knowing that things like that \u2026 [unintelligible] \u2026 puts the rest of it into perspective, China and Vietnam and all that.</p>\n<p>KISSINGER \u2013 [unintelligible] \u2026 what\u2019s important, in the big picture.</p>\n<p>NIXON \u2013 The big picture, exactly. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s so god-damn frustrating. Those fuckers on the Hill and those fucking screaming college kids. If they knew the kinds of things that we, what the GOC and our other boys were doing, they\u2019d have a god-damn parade every day. They'd build a god-damn statue, they'd say thank you, they \u2026 [unintelligible]</p>\n<p>KISSINGER \u2013 At least Brezhnev and Gromyko will have something that they can be grateful to you for, for a change. The Russians did admit that they needed our help \u2026</p>\n<p>NIXON \u2013 Speaking of gratitude, I\u2019ll tell you again, whatever we might say about the Russians, at least they, they and the GOC, are keeping that thing in its box. \u2026 [unintelligible] you think that COLD HARPER will be enough to deal with it, if it gets out?</p>\n<p>KISSINGER \u2013 Sachs had told me that it \u2026 his people think \u2026 [unintelligible] \u2026 least bad alternative, so to speak. Now as far as what those other bad alternatives were, you remember that I told you about that cable, from Dr. [unintelligible] \u2026 who said they thought they had a way to contain [unintelligible] \u2026</p>\n<p>NIXON \u2013 I almost can't think of a worse approach than to let those egghead fuckers get their hands on \u2026</p>\n<p>KISSINGER \u2013 If COLD HARPER isn't enough, well, it wouldn\u2019t matter to you and me. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re going to be on Noah\u2019s Ark.</p>\n<p>NIXON \u2013 What is it with you Jews and the gallows humor?</p>\n<p>KISSINGER \u2013 Mr. President, there have been too many times when it\u2019s all that we have left.</p>\n<p>NIXON \u2013 Yeah, well we\u2019re all in that boat, Hank.</p>\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><strong>\u00ab <a href=\"/memorandum-dated-6-november-1944\">Memorandum Dated 6 November 1944</a> | <em>COLD HARPER</em> | <a href=\"/transcript-of-telephone-conversation-august-9-1991\">Transcript of telephone conversation, August 9, 1991</a> \u00bb</strong></p>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/transcript-of-meeting-june-2-1972\">Transcript of meeting, June 2 1972</a>\" by spikebrennan, from the <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

I don\u2019t see\u00a0\u00a0\u2026\n\n\n\nMOORER \u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u2026 not even LeMay would have \u2026 [unintelligible] \n\n\n\nMEYER \u2013 \u2026 [unintelligible] would have to be a one-way trip for a lot of these boys, at this range \u2026\n\n\n\nNIXON \u2013 Look, Tom, John, I'm satisfied that it\u2019s necessary.\n\n\n\nMOORER \u2013 Whoever is there, you must really want us to get up there in a hell of a hurry and kill it.\n\n\n\nHAIG \u2013 If it comes to that.\u00a0\u00a0I sure as hell hope not, since a lot of the guys up there are ours.\u00a0\u00a0Well, his, at any rate.\n\n\n\nMEYER \u2013 So who the hell are you guys, then?\n\n\n\nSACHS \u2013 We're keeping an eye on the \u2026 object, as the President put it, until we can come up with a satisfactory way to get rid of it.\n\n\n\nMOORER \u2013 So this is your plan for disposing of the \u2026 whatever it is?\n\n\n\nNIXON \u2013 This is Plan B.\u00a0\u00a0Plan A is just holding the line, so to speak, for as long as they can in the way that they're doing it now.\n\n\n\nMEYER \u2013 With respect, sir, I don\u2019t see how we can drill this, with everything that has to be put into place for Linebacker \u2026\n\n\n\nKISSINGER \u2013 General, first of all, it has been determined for the sake of operational security that the existence of COLD HARPER itself is Foxtrot-level from which it follows that there can be no drills.\u00a0\u00a0Nobody, not even SAC command staff, who have not been designated Foxtrot-level are cleared for this.\u00a0\u00a0If the balloon goes up, you just do what you have to do to aim your planes and target your missiles in accordance with these instructions.\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, if \u2026\n\n\n\nNIXON \u2013 Where Henry is going with this is that if we\u2019re in COLD HARPER, then fuck Linebacker, fuck South Vietnam, it isn\u2019t going to matter.\n\n\n\nMOORER \u2013 But we would no longer have our nuclear deterrence against the Soviets \u2026\n\n\n\nHAIG \u2013 It doesn\u2019t matter because they will have already \u2026\n\n\n\nNIXON \u2013 I should have told Al not to bother showing you those photos, because if we do COLD HARPER then the location isn\u2019t going to look like this by the time your boys get there, John.\u00a0\u00a0It will already be hot because the Russians, who are closer, obviously, will have already hit the location with everything that they\u2019ve got.\n\n\n\nMEYER \u2013 The Soviets would, uh, would bomb themselves?\n\n\n\nKISSINGER\u00a0\u00a0\u2013 Well, it was their own idea \u2026\n\n\n\nSACHS \u2013 Technically, they\u2019d be bombing my people, but under the circumstances that would hardly matter.\n\n\n\nMEYER \u2013 I have to ask because I really don\u2019t know the answer.\u00a0\u00a0You\u2019re on our side, right?\u00a0\u00a0I mean, you\u2019re not a Russian or \u2026\n\n\n\nSACHS \u2013 Athens, Georgia sir.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Go Bulldogs.\n\n\n\nMEYER \u2013 This whole thing just doesn\u2019t make any damn sense \u2026\n\n\n\nMOORER -- We would hit this thing with our whole nuclear triad after it's already nothing but a smoking irradiated crater from what the Soviets have?\n\n\n\nKISSINGER \u2013 Not the whole triad, Admiral. Just the missiles and bombers. The subs \u2026\n\n\n\nNIXON \u2013 The boomers we will need for Noah, which I'll go over with you and Elmo Zumwalt in another briefing in a few days. \n\n\n\nMEYER \u2013 NOAA as in the weather forecasting people?\n\n\n\nKISSINGER \u2013 Noah as in ark. Don't you remember from Sunday School?\u00a0\u00a0The animals march in, two by two \u2026\n\n\n\nHAIG \u2013 [unintelligible] \u2026seeds and frozen embryos, for the most part \u2026 [unintelligible] \u2026 offload the missiles to make room \u2026\n\n\n\nNIXON \u2013 We\u2019re not ready to talk about Noah yet.\u00a0\u00a0I want to get this targeting thing settled.\u00a0\u00a0Admiral Moorer, General Meyer, I assure you that I have thought this through.\u00a0\u00a0General, you have the order.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you both for coming.\n\n\n\nMOORER \u2013 Thank you, Mr. President.\u00a0\u00a0[ADM. MOORER AND GEN. MEYER LEAVE THE MEETING.]\n\n\n\nNIXON \u2013 That settles that bit.\u00a0\u00a0Satisfied, Agent Sachs?\n\n\n\nSACHS \u2013 Yes, Mr. President.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ll report back to the \u2026 [unintelligible]\n\n\n\nNIXON \u2013 Yes, thank you for coming.\u00a0\u00a0Please tell your people \u2026 tell them that I appreciate the fine work they\u2019re doing.\n\n\n\nSACHS \u2013 Of course, sir.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Mr. President.\u00a0\u00a0[AGENT SACHS LEAVES THE MEETING]\n\n\n\nNIXON \u2013 Thanks, Al.\u00a0\u00a0Can Henry and I have the room?\n\n\n\nHAIG \u2013 Yes sir, Mr. President.\u00a0\u00a0[GENERAL HAIG LEAVES THE MEETING]\n\n\n\nNIXON \u2013 Should we get Ambassador Dobrynin over here to tell him?\u00a0\u00a0Or do you want to talk to Gromyko directly?\n\n\n\nKISSINGER \u2013 I\u2019ll call Gromyko.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ll call him as soon as I get back over to the Executive Office Building.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nNIXON \u2013 Our boys here \u2026 Henry, it wears on you, how they don\u2019t see the big picture.\n\n\n\nKISSINGER \u2013 To be fair, Mr. President, apart from the GOC and Foxtrot, and whatever the Soviets call their version of Foxtrot, they don\u2019t know \u2026\n\n\n\nNIXON \u2013 They don\u2019t know.\u00a0\u00a0And it makes you kind of jealous.\n\n\n\nKISSINGER \u2013 When you had told me, I didn\u2019t really appreciate it.\u00a0\u00a0I didn\u2019t, until Sachs and Marshal Yakubovsky took me up there last week and showed me\u2026\n\n\n\nNIXON \u2013 I\u2019m afraid that it will stay with you \u2026\n\n\n\nKISSINGER \u2013 [unintelligible] \u2026 not believe it.\u00a0\u00a0Even after the number of times they\u2019ve dropped bombs on it.\u00a0\u00a0Even the Tsar Bomba barely \u2026 [unintelligible]\n\n\n\nNIXON \u2013 \u2026 including those times in '64 and '65 when Johnson had to give them some of our bombs to use because they had run out of their own \u2026\n\n\n\nKISSINGER \u2013 \u2026 [unintelligible] still see it every time I close my eyes.\n\n\n\nNIXON \u2013 They brought me up there and showed it to me when I went to Russia under Ike in 1959.\u00a0\u00a0This was a couple of days after the Kitchen Debate.\u00a0\u00a0\u2026 Ike knew, I'm certain of it.\u00a0\u00a0He asked me to go over there.\u00a0\u00a0I guess he wanted to see whether I was ready.\u00a0\u00a0Hand me the whiskey?\n\n\n\nKISSINGER \u2013 Let me pour us each one.\n\n\n\nNIXON \u2013 [laughs] I'm going to need a taller one than that, uh, just give me the bottle back.\u00a0\u00a0You know, I didn\u2019t even use to drink very much before that trip.\u00a0\u00a0But you do what it takes and you soldier on \u2026\n\n\n\nKISSINGER \u2013 Those men at the site, they have to be there every day.\n\n\n\nNIXON \u2013 [unintelligible] \u2026 the god-damn bravest bastards in the whole world.\u00a0\u00a0Especially that guy, uh, Vassily, with the eyepatch.\u00a0\u00a0Was he still there?\n\n\n\nKISSINGER \u2013 You had told me, and I asked about him.\u00a0\u00a0They told me that he\u2019s still on the books as being assigned there, but they keep him sedated most of the time.\n\n\n\nNIXON \u2013 That\u2019s a shame.\u00a0\u00a0They told me that he had been through Stalingrad, and Berlin, but I can\u2019t \u2026 I don\u2019t think I\u2019m surprised.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nKISSINGER \u2013 [unintelligible]\n\n\n\nNIXON \u2013 You know, knowing that things like that \u2026 [unintelligible] \u2026 puts the rest of it into perspective, China and Vietnam and all that.\n\n\n\nKISSINGER \u2013 [unintelligible] \u2026 what\u2019s important, in the big picture.\n\n\n\nNIXON \u2013 The big picture, exactly.\u00a0\u00a0And that\u2019s why it\u2019s so god-damn frustrating.\u00a0\u00a0Those fuckers on the Hill and those fucking screaming college kids.\u00a0\u00a0If they knew the kinds of things that we, what the GOC and our other boys were doing, they\u2019d have a god-damn parade every day.\u00a0\u00a0They'd build a god-damn statue, they'd say thank you, they \u2026 [unintelligible]\n\n\n\nKISSINGER \u2013 At least Brezhnev and Gromyko will have something that they can be grateful to you for, for a change.\u00a0\u00a0The Russians did admit that they needed our help \u2026 \n\n\n\nNIXON \u2013 Speaking of gratitude, I\u2019ll tell you again, whatever we might say about the Russians, at least they, they and the GOC, are keeping that thing in its box.\u00a0\u00a0\u2026 [unintelligible] you think that COLD HARPER will be enough to deal with it, if it gets out?\n\n\n\nKISSINGER \u2013 Sachs had told me that it \u2026 his people think \u2026 [unintelligible] \u2026 least bad alternative, so to speak.\u00a0\u00a0Now as far as what those other bad alternatives were, you remember that I told you about that cable, from Dr. [unintelligible] \u2026 who said they thought they had a way to contain [unintelligible] \u2026\n\n\n\nNIXON \u2013 I almost can't think of a worse approach than to let those egghead fuckers get their hands on \u2026\n\n\n\nKISSINGER \u2013\u00a0\u00a0If COLD HARPER isn't enough, well, it wouldn\u2019t matter to you and me.\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s not like we\u2019re going to be on Noah\u2019s Ark.\n\n\n\nNIXON \u2013 What is it with you Jews and the gallows humor?\n\n\n\nKISSINGER \u2013 Mr. President, there have been too many times when it\u2019s all that we have left.\n\n\n\nNIXON \u2013 Yeah, well we\u2019re all in that boat, Hank.\n\n\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n\n**<<\u00a0\u00a0[[[Memorandum Dated 6 November 1944]]] | //COLD HARPER// |\u00a0\u00a0[[[Transcript of telephone conversation, August 9, 1991]]]

Just over here, an' we can have a little talk.</p>\n<p>So, the reason I'm here is\u2014stop that. It ain't gonna work. We had plenty of time t'figure out what it was you did, an' we got a fix for it.

Yeah, like yerself. Sucks t'be you, I know.</p>\n<p>Now, you could try t'run, but this gun'll stop you before you get too far. Won't kill ya, but you'll get a helluva headache when you wake up. This'd drop a horse, an' you weigh a helluva lot less than a horse.</p>\n<p>So, I came here t'find out if the rumors were true, an' there really was somethin' here matchin' your description. We saw you a couple days ago, but I figured we'd see you out on the town t'night.</p>\n<p>I always liked Halloween. I could have any face I wanted. You got a face like mine, you look forward to wearin' a mask. So I sympathize.

All we got is the best we can do.</p>\n<p>Yer ma? I'm sorry, kid. We can't go back to see her. I'll make sure to get someone t'talk to her so she don't worry too much. Honestly, she's probably not gonna remember a whole lot of this. It's one of the things we do. But we'll make sure she's okay. You got my word. Hell, tell you what. We bring you in, we'll say you agreed on condition we get some cash to her, make sure she's nice an' comfy for the rest of her life. The higher-ups will buy it. First lesson for ya. Skips who cooperate have life a hell of a lot easier than the ones who fight back. They'll get what they want no matter what, but you could make things easier on 'em. They ain't stupid. They'll reward good behavior.</p>\n<p>I can't let you go, kid. Yer in too deep. Yeah, you say you won't hurt nobody, an' I believe ya. But we ain't the only ones out there. There's other folks in this game. Only they don't want to keep you contained. They wanna kill you, or worse, turn you into a weapon. They could make you hurt people. I seen it done. An' they'll hurt people t'get to you. People like yer ma.</p>\n<p>See, there's a lot of threats out there. Some of 'em are other people. Some of 'em are things that would destroy the world if we let 'em. I've seen what's out there, an' it ain't friendly. Some of it's wonderful, some of it may help us, but some of it sincerely scares the shit outta me, an' I don't scare easy. There are so many things out to get us, someone's gotta be out there on humanity's side.</p>\n<p>Nobody's on your side? \u2026Yeah, but I'll tell ya what. You have any real problems, you think your bein' treated too cruel, tell yer guard to get word to Max Lombardi. I don't got a whole lotta pull myself, but I could maybe put a word in the ear of someone who does. Ain't gonna promise nothin'. Nobody's gonna make everythin' right, y'know. We just do the best we can.</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/trick-or-treat\">Trick or Treat</a>\" by DrEverettMann, from the <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

someone t'talk to her so she don't worry too much.\u00a0\u00a0Honestly, she's probably not gonna remember a whole lot of this.\u00a0\u00a0It's one of the things we do.\u00a0\u00a0But we'll make sure she's okay.\u00a0\u00a0You got my word.\u00a0\u00a0Hell, tell you what.\u00a0\u00a0We bring you in, we'll say you agreed on condition we get some cash to her, make sure she's nice an' comfy for the rest of her life.\u00a0\u00a0The higher-ups will buy it.\u00a0\u00a0First lesson for ya.\u00a0\u00a0Skips who cooperate have life a hell of a lot easier than the ones who fight back.\u00a0\u00a0They'll get what they want no matter what, but you could make things easier on 'em.\u00a0\u00a0They ain't stupid.\u00a0\u00a0They'll reward good behavior.\n\n\n\nI can't let you go, kid.\u00a0\u00a0Yer in too deep.\u00a0\u00a0Yeah, you say you won't hurt nobody, an' I believe ya.\u00a0\u00a0But we ain't the only ones out there.\u00a0\u00a0There's other folks in this game.\u00a0\u00a0Only they don't want to keep you contained.\u00a0\u00a0They wanna kill you, or worse, turn you into a weapon.\u00a0\u00a0They could make you hurt people.\u00a0\u00a0I seen it done.\u00a0\u00a0An' they'll hurt people t'get to you.\u00a0\u00a0People like yer ma.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nSee, there's a lot of threats out there.\u00a0\u00a0Some of 'em are other people.\u00a0\u00a0Some of 'em are things that would destroy the world if we let 'em.\u00a0\u00a0I've seen what's out there, an' it ain't friendly.\u00a0\u00a0Some of it's wonderful, some of it may help us, but some of it sincerely scares the shit outta me, an' I don't scare easy.\u00a0\u00a0There are so many things out to get us, someone's gotta be out there on humanity's side.\n\n\n\nNobody's on your side?\u00a0\u00a0...Yeah, but I'll tell ya what.\u00a0\u00a0You have any real problems, you think your bein' treated too cruel, tell yer guard to get word to Max Lombardi.\u00a0\u00a0I don't got a whole lotta pull myself, but I could maybe put a word in the ear of someone who does.\u00a0\u00a0Ain't gonna promise nothin'.\u00a0\u00a0Nobody's gonna make everythin' right, y'know.\u00a0\u00a0We just do the best we can.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[!-- N/A (No

Please\u2026 Sit down. No, I insist.</p>\n<p>It's time we had a chat, the two of us. No, I think this is the perfect time. It's not like we're going to get another. Not with the way things are now. We've got a possible plan, but I don't think Stimson will be successful. He's not the sharpest knife in the drawer, you know. Not at all\u2026 Not at all\u2026</p>\n<p>You see, my boy, I understand you. I understand you quite perfectly. All the rest think you're varying levels of sinner and saint, that you somehow understand something special about us, that you might make the next, logical successor for one of us\u2026 They're all quite right, to some level. You certainly are passionate. I could see you doing anything to uphold the mission of the Foundation. Anything at all.</p>\n<p>You should have done it already, Everett. You should have found all thirteen of us, pulled out a gun, and shot us in the head. Don't pretend that you hadn't already considered it. I know that you've got plans for us, for each of us, that would be at least moderately successful. You'd probably have eliminated the bulk of them. Probably. Not me, though. Not that it matters now, anyway.</p>\n<p>But now, it's too late. Far, far too late. We let things go on too long. Let them snowball. I don't doubt that you'll struggle to the very end. You strike me as the sort to, honestly. Admirable. One of the few admirable things about you, really.</p>\n<p>Do you know when I realized I wasn't playing God, Everett? I'll tell you. It was when they wouldn't let me bring my son back. Do you know how long it took me to get to this point? This point in my life? I <em>don't age</em>, Mann. I may never die, if all things go well. I wanted a family, though\u2026 Silly of me, wasn't it? Wanting a family. I had one. They took them from me, though. One at a time. T.J. Elliot. Jack\u2026 Poor Jack.</p>\n<p>When did you first figure it out, Everett? What we were really doing?</p>\n<p>Heh. I suppose that makes sense. The Insurgency always was our biggest hole.

Please... Sit down. No, I insist.\n\n\n\nIt's time we had a chat, the two of us. No, I think this is the perfect time. It's not like we're going to get another.\u00a0\u00a0Not with the way things are now. We've got a possible plan, but I don't think Stimson will be successful.\u00a0\u00a0He's not the sharpest knife in the drawer, you know. Not at all... Not at all...\n\n\n\nYou see, my boy, I understand you.\u00a0\u00a0I understand you quite perfectly. All the rest think you're varying levels of sinner and saint, that you somehow understand something special about us, that you might make the next, logical successor for one of us... They're all quite right, to some level. You certainly are passionate. I could see you doing anything to uphold the mission of the Foundation. Anything at all.\n\n\n\nYou should have done it already, Everett.\u00a0\u00a0You should have found all thirteen of us, pulled out a gun, and shot us in the head.\u00a0\u00a0Don't pretend that you hadn't already considered it. I know that you've got plans for us, for each of us, that would be at least moderately successful.\u00a0\u00a0You'd probably have eliminated the bulk of them.\u00a0\u00a0Probably.\u00a0\u00a0Not me, though. Not that it matters now, anyway.\n\n\n\nBut now, it's too late.\u00a0\u00a0Far, far too late.\u00a0\u00a0We let things go on too long. Let them snowball.\u00a0\u00a0I don't doubt that you'll struggle to the very end.\u00a0\u00a0You strike me as the sort to, honestly.\u00a0\u00a0Admirable.\u00a0\u00a0One of the few admirable things about you, really.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nDo you know when I realized I wasn't playing God, Everett?\u00a0\u00a0I'll tell you.\u00a0\u00a0It was when they wouldn't let me bring my son back.\u00a0\u00a0Do you know how long it took me to get to this point?\u00a0\u00a0This point in my life?\u00a0\u00a0I //don't age//, Mann.\u00a0\u00a0I may never die, if all things go well.\u00a0\u00a0I wanted a family, though... Silly of me, wasn't it? Wanting a family. I had one. They took them from me, though. One at a time.\u00a0\u00a0T.J. Elliot. Jack... Poor Jack.\n\n\n\nWhen did you first figure it out, Everett? What we were really doing?\n\n\n\nHeh.\u00a0\u00a0I suppose that makes sense. The Insurgency always was our biggest hole.\u00a0\u00a0Could never find a way to explain it away... Agatha tried a few times, but... Ahh, well. Makes sense, I suppose... And when did you find out that we were\u2014\n\n\n\nReally? Hmm... Well, it's too late for that to matter now.\u00a0\u00a0They've done it, whoever they are.\u00a0\u00a0Whatever we called forth through that [[[dr-manns-proposal|blasted chink]]] in the universe's armor.\u00a0\u00a0You want to know the best part, Doctor? I don't regret any of it. \n\n\n\nNone of it, Everett.\u00a0\u00a0Not that ridiculous lizard or its brood, not those little crabs that slice and cut like they're nothing, not the madmen or the demons or the cakes\u2014the god damned cakes! We were //trying// to //feed// the //world//, Mann! We didn't realize what we were //doing//! We //never// realized what we were doing! //NEVER//!\n\n\n\nWe just... we didn't realize... We wanted to make the world better, and then... Things fell apart. Things always fall apart...\n\n\n\nYes, I know.\u00a0\u00a0I'm completely mad. We all were. We'd have to be, for what we did.\u00a0\u00a0But we were mad with a purpose. Creation... Blissful, glorious creation.\u00a0\u00a0We were God in the garden, Everett.

Barely a daydream, and yet\u2026 The proper forms were filed, the proper investigations taken, and, finally, everything approved. A single instance of <a href=\"/scp-500\">SCP-500</a> was fed through <a href=\"/scp-786\">SCP-786</a>. And then, fed through a second time. Then, the pill now being too large to once more fit through the funnel, a chunk was removed, and the test was repeated, for quite some time, resulting in a near infinite supply of SCP-500. The pills were crushed, powdered very fine\u2026 and then introduced into the world's water supply. Virtually over night, all diseases were cured. Behold, a better world.</p>\n<p>\u2026Or so they had thought. Alas, it was not meant to be. <a href=\"/scp-500\">SCP-500</a> was successfully re-purposed to cure all the world's ills, but what we failed to realize was that one Ill plagued the planet more than any other: <strong>Man.</strong> One by one men died inexplicably, their bodies decomposing instantly into dust so their corpses would not mar the landscape. The survivors either died of dehydration, or committed suicide right then and there, knowing that no hope remained. In time, the waters tainted by the pill washed away all of man's creation, leaving only pristine, untainted wildlife. A healthy world in all respects, but one without humans to enjoy it. I alone sit at this table, recording the last words of a dead species. My last words finished, I pick up the gun and\u2026</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u2026Wake up. If only the world had gone out that way; so simple and so peaceful. Instead we tampered with forces we could not understand.</p>\n<p>It was such a simple idea, really. Barely a day dream, and yet\u2026 The proper forms were filed, the proper investigations taken, and, finally, everything approved. Using <a href=\"/scp-289\">SCP-289</a> and a carefully timed set of scales and counterweights, engines and pulleys, we constructed a perpetual motion machine of such enormous scale that the entire world would be able to have unlimited free power forever. I can't tell you how we did it\u2026 hell, I don't even remember all the details. But I remember that day clearly, the day they first added SCP-289 to the device. \"Nothing can go wrong\" they told me. The naive fools\u2026</p>\n<p>The GOC warned us, then they attacked, but we fought them off and then wiped them out. They were the heroes and we, the bad guys, won. The entire disaster was a product of carelessness, but hell, we were cross-testing left and right and it really doesn\u2019t get more careless than that.</p>\n<p>The World Engine was a giant fucking machine, and not just any conventional giant fucking machine. Not a single drop of petroleum or a single ampere of electrical current ran through the World Engine. Inertia had been shattered into bits; everything was kinetic, except for a couple cubed miles of water keeping the whole operation cooled down. It was, in a word, old-school. It was their style.</p>\n<p>It was just one SCP. No big deal. In the old days the higher-ups would have been scared shitless, but we were invincible now. We lost track of a pile of rusty, salt-encrusted gears. No big deal.</p>\n<p>Seventy-two hours later, witnesses reported steam bursting from the coolant tanks of the World Engine. Thirty minutes after that, we recorded the first heartbeats of the World Engine.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Desperate times called for desperate measures. Psychics were running amok and sooner or later, probably sooner, the public would notice.</p>\n<p>We had found Prometheus Labs, found them and their recipes and their diagrams and reverse-engineered their crown jewel\u2014<a href=\"/scp-148\">SCP-148</a>, Telekill. Mass production began on March 25th. Come Fall the mist of Telekill descended upon the globe; tiny flakes of the metal, invisible to the human eye and completely harmless and unnoticeable when ingested or inhaled, but a death sentence to psychics and telepaths.</p>\n<p>By winter, just about everything with a brain larger than a walnut was dead.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Telekill did its job perfectly, but every human, maybe every sentient being, has a very limited capacity for psionics. \u00a0For almost all of us, it's barely there - those little flashes of what the other guy is thinking or the location of something when you couldn't possibly know that. Petty occurrences, easily dismissed as coincidence or luck. \u00a0Occasionally someone gets an extra-large helping, but everyone gets some of it.</p>\n<p>The dust didn't bother with degree. If you had even the slightest trace of ability, that made you first a target and then a victim.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are maybe a few thousand left. Those of us who managed to isolate our air and water supplies from the dust. But we can't leave, can't resupply and won't survive. Civilization, gone in an eye-</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>-blink. Must have dozed off. Understandable, we've all been going for 2 days or more to finish this.</p>\n<p>It's a small change. Nothing serious, nothing wildly risky. Just some - alright, several million with the current breeding programme - pet kittens to get people in key positions a little more relaxed. \u00a0Hopefully, after everyone's spent a few days d'awwing over the nearest <a href=\"/scp-2558-j\">SCP-2558-J</a> things will be\u2026calmer. Quieter. Friendlier. And then, behold: a better world.</p>\n<p>Well\u2026 that's what they thought. See, here's the thing about those deadly little balls of fluff: they don't like sudden noises. We introduced them into the world, and of course, what do parents do? They give them to their children. Children are alright, I guess. Except that they can be loud.</p>\n<p>I remember when it started. Two of the things had been brought to a home, and the children got so excited. But then they started to fight, and the little puffballs\u2026 puffed up. The resulting puffage caused the children (and their parents) to shriek and scream, which caused their neighbors (also proud owners of the things) to slam open their doors and ask, \"What?!\" This, of course, caused MORE puffsplosions, and before you knew it, with a shriek or a telephone ringing or anything like that, the world was FILLED with puffballs.</p>\n<p>The worst part had to be that no one cared. The world was being drowned in puffballs. No one could breathe, or see, or anything. They just sat there and said 'Dawwwww\u2026' They cooed over these things as they wiped out about half of humanity. The rest of us, though? We're down here, away from those things. Every now and then, when we run the tap, we get a puffball. It's simply unimaginable\u2026 and it feels like any second now we'll just\u2026</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>239. It's perfect. She can change reality, right? Make things better? And we can control her. So, that's what we'll do, control her. Feed her a carefully crafted story, about how all the world's governments decided to get together, and make the world a better place. And, fucked me if it didn't work! A world with no pollution, no war, and, even better, everyone can do magic!</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the one crippling flaw of this system, like so many others, was that it was dependent on a simple human being, who was susceptible to so many human flaws like emotion, temptation, greed, fear, and outright neglect. Putting 239 in power was like handing the world to every crackpot power hungry dictator that ever existed. The world and reality itself bent and warped to the whims of a prepubescent girl with no preconceptions of how the world has or should work. Her handlers foolishly thought that they had her under control, carefully feeding her the information only they wanted her to know. Little did they know that they were already under her spell, trapped within their own delusions.</p>\n<p>The world soon became 239's sandbox, and like any child in a sandbox, she experimented. Continents were torn asunder, plagues of stuffed (and in some cases real) animals fell from the sky, and the planet kept shuffling from having one moon to six. 239 cared not for the suffering and deaths of countless people during these upheavals. She was never taught to comprehend the plight of people she knew nothing about. But like all humans, 239 eventually became bored with meddling with Earth's affairs. There had to be something better to do.</p>\n<p>Then she looked up at the sky. She had done that many times before, but this time was different. Something deep and primeval stirred within her mind, another aspect of humanity that made her the most dangerous being of all. Curiosity.</p>\n<p>And the stars themselves shall tremble\u2026</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>War. War was everywhere and inevitable. From wars between countries right down to arguments in the street, conflict was simply considered a part of human nature, as natural to the species as eating and sleeping. But what if there was a way to change that? To eliminate war and conflict from the equation altogether?</p>\n<p>Through aggressive breeding and cloning programs, huge flocks of <a href=\"/scp-514\">SCP-514</a> were manufactured. Enough flocks to cover the world in their miraculous aura. Things started off slow at first. After all, the birds needed time to properly disperse and cover ground. But slowly and surely, reports of their activity began trickling, and then flooding, in. Overnight, entire military bases and armies would disappear in a matter of seconds. Armories and weapon caches would suddenly be stocked with broken weaponry, and people who were once mortal enemies embraced each other with open arms.</p>\n<p>With no weapons and no aggression, the world finally knew true peace. At least for a time.</p>\n<p>Too bad it didn't work on the things which needed it most. The old man, the Lizard, Able, the red pool\u2026 nothing could stop them. The pool was still angry. It knew it was free to attack. It spawned countless creations of fire, claws, poisons\u2026 They broke out within seconds. The Americas were turned into hellholes in a week. Then Able got free. Countless Keter objects made it out. After three days from his escape, nothing was left. <a href=\"/scp-514\">SCP-514</a> turned the world to dust.</p>\n<p>Those of us who survived used less than friendly SCP's and objects. Many of our staff are lacking in <em>something</em> from begging the desk for help, and others are mutated and altered to the point where death looks like a better option in hindsight. At least humanity has a remote chance of survival, even if it's all for naught.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Clockwork. Simple? Check. Compatible? Check. Perfect? No. We realized that the hard way. It was just months after we released the Clockwork Virus upon the world in order to rid the less than useful problems of transplants and the complexities of biology. Nothing would be more simple for humanity if everyone could understand brain surgery, and a tree could be remade to be a leg, right?</p>\n<p>And it was simple. So simple. So mind-numbingly simple and perfect. But that's the point, it was mind-numbing. There were no emotions, no ingenuity, no curiosity. And as one machine we decided life had no point, there was nothing to strive for. And we died.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Or that was what the test group wrote to us before they killed themselves. Poor fellows.</p>\n<p>But there was something that did have a successful test group. We were on the brink of war, and it seems the human race would destroy itself. That was when administration made a decision to release <a href=\"/scp-444\">SCP-444</a> upon the world.</p>\n<p>\u2026It worked beautifully at first. Entire armies slowly transformed into peaceful communities, first led by pacifists, then by carefully selected Foundation agents. We steered the world towards a perfect state, without conflict of any kind. We learned to adapt to a purely vegetarian lifestyle, as farmhands grew steadily unable to summon the aggression to kill livestock. We grew used to the restriction of medical procedures, as physicians became unable to cut or suture and pharmaceutical animal testing ended. We grew used to the unceasing baby boom of 5 and 7 and 10 and 15 children per family. But then things came to a head as finally, there were no more leaders, no more uninfected agents, no more unconcerned O5s. And then we grew used to the televised images of mass starvations not just in undeveloped, forgotten countries, but in Japan and France and Norway and America. And then we grew used to ourselves searching for that last bag of sugar, that last pot of rice, that last can of peas. And then we grew used to chewing grass and twigs into a paste for the silent children. And then we died, weak and hungry. And then the babies wept, still silent, as their limbs shriveled and their bellies swelled. And then the babies died, with no one to care for them or mourn them.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The decision was made. Foundation researchers finally received permission to conduct a large-scale system of exposure to <a href=\"/scp-028\">SCP-028</a>. Dozens of people would be sent through the empty storage yard every day and thoroughly interviewed and, if need be, interrogated to determine what they had learned. Every scrap of information would be recorded, analyzed and, if deemed sufficiently valuable, released to the general public.</p>\n<p>The first month alone resulted in designs for a cold-fusion plant that could power a city the size of London indefinitely, the composition of a fertilizer that would break down harmlessly in seawater and the name of the designer of <a href=\"/scp-914\">SCP-914</a>. The Foundation, through its numerous fronts, was rapidly able to improve the quality of life of almost every human on Earth, providing the world with the technologies and knowledge it needed to become a better place.</p>\n<p>Then James Harrison Reuben walked through the yard.</p>\n<p>James Harrison Reuben was a cable repairman from Topeka, Kansas. A blue-collar worker in a simple, menial job. A perfect receptacle for knowledge. We sent him in with visions of new advancements and beautiful new technologies dancing through our heads.</p>\n<p>He came out with the knowledge of how to conquer the world.</p>\n<p>It's been seven years since then. His armies and death squads march through the streets of every city in the world. Every battle is a devastating victory: how can it be otherwise, when he has perfect knowledge of all our battle plans before they even happen? It is only a matter of time before he overruns our final stronghold.</p>\n<p>I'm sending this message out through our wide-band radio transmitter on the off chance that someone will get this message. I'm doing this because the last transmission of our intelligence operatives, before they went dark, shows that Reuben is building space ships. Hundreds of them, lined up in ranks stretching across the Florida coastline.</p>\n<p>But I can't shake the feeling that maybe this is all part of his plan as well\u2026</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"Why didn't anyone think of it before!?\" they said. \"It's the perfect solution!\" they exclaimed. \"We'll just shoot <a href=\"/scp-231\">SCP-231</a> into SPACE!\"</p>\n<p>So we did! Loaded her up onto a booster rocket for a \"communications\" satellite and shot her straight towards the sun, wiped off our hands, and congratulated each other on a job well done. Now we don't need to live with the knowledge that brutal and horrible things are being done to a little girl every day!</p>\n<p>Um\u2026 yeah.</p>\n<p>All it took was a single incorrectly fixed plate on the rocket. The whole thing blew up in the atmosphere, releasing a monstrosity outside the foundation's range of control. The damn thing survived the fall, ravaging its way across the planet, killing everything in its path. We weaponized everything we could, sent everything at it, but we couldn't stop it. Now we have no choice but to try and evacuate everything in its path, to hope we can stop it before it wipes out what remains of humanity.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><a href=\"/scp-343\">SCP-343</a>- he's perfect right? The one true god, worshiped by all religions. All we had to do was ask Him to appear to the world. Grant a few miracles, talk to the religious leaders of the planet. Before you know it, all religious war, gone. People have no reason to kill each other over differences, now that everyone believes in the same faith. And He can provide scarce resources, like food and oil. All war gone, all of civilization is now free to focus on advancement, to work towards a golden age of humanity.</p>\n<p>But then He started coming for <strong>us</strong>. He promoted himself very quickly to O7, a position that He invented. And He had no idea how most of the SCP items worked. He wasn't familiar with the SCP items, He didn't create them, and He couldn't comprehend them. He gave up on trying to contain them, and instead decided to exert His control over the humans, who He did create. He cancelled containment procedures on any SCP item that required moral ambiguity to keep locked up - and, because of the interlocked structure of the Foundation, that amounted to everything. Everything's loose now and we might as well already be dead.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>So we decided to use <a href=\"/scp-184\">SCP-184</a> to increase our storage space. We wouldn't keep it in any given room for too long, so we wouldn't wind up with the labyrinthine nightmares that were initially its signature. We'd just leave it there long enough that each room was somewhat larger on the inside than on the outside, so we could fit more supplies in the same area. It worked great. The Foundation was running more smoothly than ever, and the effort we'd previously spent on securing more land to build Sites at could now be put into more important tasks, like neutralizing <a href=\"/scp-682\">SCP-682</a>, or trying to find a cure for <a href=\"/scp-217\">SCP-217</a>. The world seemed closer to safety than ever before, but we hadn't quite thought things through with 184\u2026</p>\n<p>We're not sure exactly what happened. We heard various stories; a containment breach at a bad time, an attack by the Insurgency, or just some poor fool dropping the damn thing. All we know is, 184 got damaged.</p>\n<p>Turns out, 184 has to be in one piece for its effect to work. With it damaged, everything it had modified began to 'shift', trying to revert to their original state. Rooms grew and shrank, hallways twisted and turned, and chaos erupted. We tried to fix it, to put it back together, but that just made things worse.</p>\n<p>Within a week, every single modified building had suffered total structural failure.</p>\n<p>With a failure of this magnitude, containment was impossible. Our cover was irrevocably blown, hundreds of dangerous SCPs were loose, and the world was furious. Almost overnight, fingers were pointed, blame was laid, and war erupted. Armies mobilized, missiles were launched, and civilization as we know it was destroyed.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>As we continued to expand, so did our enemies. We faced stiff competition for control of SCP artifacts; the Serpent's Hand, the Church, the Chaos Insurgency\u2026</p>\n<p>The O5s decided it was time to put a stop to this. Under their orders, we trained a small group of Agents. Agents who had proven themselves time and time again, whose loyalty to the Foundation was absolute and unshakeable. We equipped them with the best armor and weapons we had, used whatever SCPs we could to improve them. We ran hundreds of simulations, set up dozens of failsafes, and finally, we were confident we were ready.</p>\n<p>We gave them <a href=\"/scp-668\">SCP-668</a>.</p>\n<p>It worked beautifully. The Agents were unstoppable. Within a month, the Hand and the Church had been crushed. And it didn't stop there; MC&amp;D, the Chaos Insurgency, the ORIA all fell within six months. The GOC attacked us when they learned what we were doing, and we slaughtered them as well. Our database swelled, with thousands of SCPs liberated from the corpses of our foes. Everything was under control, and nothing could stop us.</p>\n<p>Nothing. Somehow, don't ask me, SCP-668's effect changed ever so slightly. And now, nobody can run from us and I mean <em>nobody</em>. The whole world stood still while the last Agent to carry the knife went mad with loneliness, stabbing his way through towns and cities. He even got here. He looked right at me and put this goddamn knife in my hand.</p>\n<p>And then I stabbed him. I wander now, looking for something, anything. A reason to keep on walking. But the helpless, terrified people died of starvation long ago. There is nothing left to stab.</p>\n<p>Well, that's not quite true. There's me.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>It wasn't an easy job, and probably not worth the trouble.</p>\n<p>The geniuses of the Foundation gathered and worked. It took months, but they managed to fundamentally alter <a href=\"/scp-079\">SCP-079</a>'s programming. We took away its unwillingness to cooperate with us. And then we put it to work. SCP-079's brilliant computer mind could contain these abominations better than a team of experts ever could. Containment breaches went to near zero.</p>\n<p>It was perfect.</p>\n<p>So perfect, in fact, that the only way any of the Skips could escape is if a human deliberately released them.</p>\n<p>So it did the only logical thing: it called for the destruction of mankind. Faster than you could say \"I told you so!\", it fired every nuclear missile we had into the atmosphere. Entire continents were irradiated in the course of a single night.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Hey guys, I've got a great idea! Let's strap a big gun to <a href=\"/scp-682\">SCP 682</a> and use it to fight the Chaos Insurgency! <em>WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG!?</em></p>\n<p>And amazingly, <em>impossibly</em>, it actually <strong>WORKED</strong>! The one thing that had never been tried in all this time had been to try to work WITH 682 instead of trying to destroy it. The Chaos Insurgency fought back, triggering countless defenses and offenses that we had unknowingly been programing into 682 every time we tried to destroy it. It fought with us against our enemies for months, then years, until finally we were completely victorious.</p>\n<p>That's when 682 unleashed its adaptation against peace.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Friendly to everyone that talked to him. Good behavior. The perfect spy. We recruited <a href=\"/scp-423\">SCP-423</a> to seek out the world's secrets and bring them to us. All he wanted was to be acknowledged as an Agent of the Foundation instead of a thing for study.</p>\n<p>So, as a test, we sent him out to infiltrate a world government and return to us with specific plans we knew of. Just a test run\u2026</p>\n<p>We got the information, all right. We also got Fred's new friend, \"Tom\". An hour later there were a hundred more. By the end of the day every book, every data file, and even the graffiti in the men's room toilets were nothing more then a collection of random names.</p>\n<p>After a hundred years I'm the only one left who remembers what a book looks like, guarding the last library in a cavern of rock miles beneath the rock. They send me their children, and I pretend to smile as they babble on about Fred and Jane and Bob and all the other names they see on the walls above. I keep them away from the books (they don't try to hurt me any more - that is my punishment), and try to teach them how to repair the generators and build the locks and raise crops (and isn't that a perfect irony?) Without the words only the Foundation knew how to be anything more then feral - and every year they send me fewer and fewer. In another hundred, there will only be me among my degraded brotherhood of man who remembers the Word.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Why the hell did we even hold on to <a href=\"/scp-523\">SCP-523</a>? Its one and only property was to make everything around it worse. The best possible thing we could do is send it far away.</p>\n<p>We gave it to an Agent and arranged for them to be picked up by the Chaos Insurgency. Every member was dead within a week.</p>\n<p>It was then acquired by the Office For The Reclamation of Islamic Artifacts. They died as well. We managed to engineer the object's passage to every rival organization of ours, and every time it worked beyond our wildest dreams. MC&amp;D, the Church of the Broken God, all of them were brought to their knees.</p>\n<p>The item was making its rounds through the ranks of the Serpent's Hand and wreaking havoc when <a href=\"/scp-616\">SCP-616</a> opened. Not when it was supposed to either, the thing opened two hours before a scheduled flight while it was still on the runway, and I'll be damned if I know why. The containment team was already there, and they were able to hold it off for a bit\u2026then something came out. We still don't know what the hell it is\u2014all we know is that we lost all contact with Site [REDACTED] right afterwards. Then it started to move. Nothing we sent could stop it, and thousands went mad as they beheld\u2026whatever it was. The panic started to set in around then. Personnel deserted their posts, ran back to their families. Containment for most of our other high-risk items failed over the course of the next day as more and more of our guards left. The world suddenly became aware of our masquerade, and of items like 173, 076, 682, and 008. We were overwhelmed, and that's when 523 kicked in.</p>\n<p>I don't know what the hell it did or how it did it. All I know is that we haven't been able to raise transmissions from Earth for weeks. The entire planet looks like it's covered with this giant cloud of dust and none of our gear can see through it. As far as we know, we're the last survivors of the human race, here on the Mare Imbrium. If it wasn't for 120, we'd be still on Earth with the rest. Our supplies have begun to run low and someone's going to have to return to Earth for more. Whether we like it or not, we have to find out what happened\u2026</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u2026I've got to stop eating the cafeteria chili. God, that stuff gives me weird dreams.</p>\n<p>Anyhow, that gives me an idea. If we just do a bit more research on <a href=\"/scp-120\">SCP-120</a>, we could create our own teleportation system. Say goodbye to expensive transportation and all that. We could almost completely eliminate fossil fuels! Bring food to famine-stricken countries with great ease! And there's absolutely nothing that could go wrong with this one, of course. Right?</p>\n<p>Except, it did.</p>\n<p>It turns out, we didn't really understand the inner workings of the SCP. Our best quantum physicists assured us they knew what they were doing, and soon we had a workable prototype. We had everything ready, a 1 pound weight to be teleported 5 miles south, nothing could possibly go wrong, Eh? We geared it up and then, poof, it was gone, with it, the entire US East Coast, down to the core.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>What? Oh, I have some really morbid ideas, don't I?</p>\n<p>Anyways, we were working with <a href=\"/scp-914\">SCP-914</a> and realized, after putting a microwave, a small boiler, a blender, and some gears into it on 'Very Fine' for about 5 times, we got our own Star Trek style Replicator, and it worked alright. What if we used it to create everything we needed dearly, from super-dense wall materials to better suits for handling Keter objects? It'll just be a walk in the park and soon, no more shortages of this, lack of that, and so on!</p>\n<p>Obviously, the first thing we made was more replicators, and with hundreds working all around the world it was looking like utopia was very quickly coming up. The problem was, none of us realized that the thing <em>wasn't</em> breaking the laws of conservation of mass and energy. We never realized where it was coming from.</p>\n<p>The first cracks started appearing about seventeen years after Project Cornucopia went underway. Pockets taken here or there were starting to build up, especially as we were creating larger, denser objects. On May 17th, Hawaii fell into the ocean. Two weeks later, half of Asia was buried in lava. It turns out the planet wasn't particularly stable, given that we'd accidentally used up huge swaths of the lower crust, and now half the world was falling into the mantle and the other half had the mantle erupting out. The only plus side is that the Star Wars conventions held some epic \"Anakin Vs Obi-Wan\" re-enactments, before the west coast melted.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Holy\u2026 I told Jeff there was something funny with that milk in the fridge. What a nightmare\u2026</p>\n<p>Seriously though, someone got to thinking: world peace, the end of need, permanent containment. All of that is way outside of human control, and despite having \"God\" in a luxury suite, he wouldn't do anything for us. So, what if we didn't ask \"God\"? Someone set up <a href=\"/scp-738\">SCP-738</a> and asked a simple question: \"Can you make the world safe, so that all of mankind can be peaceful and happy?\" There was a very, very long pause, and the answer was, \"Are you willing to let one hundred million people die?\"</p>\n<p>One hundred million, against seven-point-something billion? That's a pretty small percentage\u2026</p>\n<p>It was really too bad that 738 had a very special way of killing those people. An unknown entity breached containment in hundreds of SCPs. Unknown anomalies popped up out of nowhere. What did they all have in common? They were memetic. Out of seven-point-something billion, less than one-thousand people were left unaffected. The appropriate terms for the affected were \"Zombie,\" \"Brainwashed,\" and \"Retards.\" Very little, if any higher brain function, was left in those billions of people. But they were all quite safe, never hurting each other, never hurting themselves.</p>\n<p>It was years before anyone would come out of hiding. Half the O5s, for example, refused adamantly to leave their bunkers. But soon, supplies ran short. When they came out, everyone was just staring at them with blank, expressionless, dull eyes. And when most of the unaffected people gathered in Berlin, that's when the one hundred million people died. They didn't even use knives, just their bare hands. But they were happy. I guess\u2026</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Virtual Reality. It's never been an actual reality, sadly. Imagine, everything could be perfect there! Why make life perfect when we can just convince everyone that it's perfect? We know how well actually trying works\u2026</p>\n<p><a href=\"/scp-826\">SCP-826</a> could do that for us. Hundreds of Foundation authors collaborated to come up with perfection. No more space requirements, no more war, and constant euphoria. It was how life ought to be, really. It was a perfect idea.</p>\n<p>After a few months of work, we figured out how to take multiple people across, and Dr. Gligoric got promoted for figuring out how to make everyone arrive in sync. By then, nothing held the plan up. We issued number IDs determining when your turn to go across, and soon enough, as many as two hundred people went through per day, set on establishing a new life in the perfect fictional realm, then a thousand\u2026then five\u2026 we kept improving the transport process. And it was wonderful.</p>\n<p>At first. Heck, the first eight iterations were.<br/>\nSee, we knew when the plot ended, people that stayed in became a part of the universe in the next iterations, complete with a new memory. We even welcomed it as it made it harder for anyone that went in to abuse the setting Groundhog Day-style.<br/>\nWhat we didn't foresee due to the small testing scale was that the thing put the people it naturalized into roles they best fit within the continuity, even if it meant altering the setting .<br/>\nIt wasn't obvious at first - thing is, our world doesn't do that, so most of those going across ended up doing something else over there. But by three iterations since the first researcher's number came up, the story included a bad skip outbreak. As about a tenth of the population has made the move by then, we responded by sending a few MTFs across to contain it.<br/>\nThe next plot iteration included the RSN Society (Retrieve, Store, Neutralize.) , and unfortunately, they didn't take extrareality incursions any better than we'd have - the next time we sent a bunch of agents through to check if the world is still worth migrating into, they didn't return and neither did <a href=\"/scp-826\">SCP-826</a>. Wasn't the end of it, either - apparently they have figured out how to send their skips across to us as a foolproof means of containment.<br/>\nBy this day, we have secured thirty five instances of <a href=\"/scp-231\">SCP-231</a> of differing age and health.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Fuck. This is what happens when you doze off at work. Work.. everything is work! This might be worth a try!\u2026</p>\n<p>After a few successful tests, Site-35 was made into a training centre, and I got a promotion out of it. Controlled <a href=\"/scp-1011\">SCP-1011</a> exposure combined with martial arts training took a month to make an untrained MTF greenhorn into someone who could rip a Broken God Crusader into cogs in hand-to-hand combat. Sharpshooters didn't need scopes anymore. Researchers developed an intuitive feel for quantum mechanics ,and solving a differential equation became as natural as adding 2+2.<br/>\nIntel agents\u2026 let's say that they managed to track down Dr. Wondertainment.<br/>\nIn less than a year we held the reins of the world, and by the looks of it, we were up to the task.</p>\n<p>Until the day that the statue awoke and called out to all its Children; \"Bring all of the Unblessed unto me so they can gaze upon My countenance.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>It all started with a vacation request. When <a href=\"/scp-208\">SCP-208</a> asked if he could visit the Libyan Desert for a few weeks, he was told his unique healing skills were needed at Site-17. He then asked for an assistant to train as a substitute. A week later Bes got into <a href=\"/scp-222\">SCP-222</a>, then trained his newly created clone. \"Bes Jr.\" turned out to be every bit as helpful as the original. Within a few months there was a Bes stationed at every major Foundation site. The deathrate dropped and morale surged. Inevitably, this in turn spawned 'Project Nightingale', an attempt to place a Bes in every major city on Earth. A small colony of Bes was founded on a small uninhabited island in Indonesia with a falsified culture and prehistory implying Egyptian origins. Video footage showed computer-generated females and adolescents added to the all-adult male population. The Bes were accepted by the world as a cousin to <em>Homo sapiens</em>, and they were eventually integrated into every country as healers. Although they were never great in number, they helped make the world a better place.</p>\n<p>Early results not withstanding, existing data on the effects of long-term SCP-208 exposure soon proved totally insufficient for dealing with the consequences of the expanded SCP population. Over time, affected individuals began to enjoy proximity to SCP instances to greater and greater degrees\u2014people loved being near Bes, and loved it more, much more, than doing anything else at all.</p>\n<p>Seventeen weeks into Project Nightingale, the first tent cities began to form around major hospitals. Satellite footage taken during week twenty-five showed the largest mass migration in human history as millions walked, rode, and flew to be closer to the nearest Bes. After thirty-three weeks Dr. Elliott Colla at the University of Chicago diagnosed the first case of Bes-Induced Catatonic State. Nuclear reactors in Ukraine and Belarus went critical as supervisors left their posts and global food supplies collapsed with no one to tend the fields.</p>\n<p>By the end of the first year self-neglect had claimed the lives of three hundred and seventy million people, but nobody seemed to mind\u2026</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u2026And just as you start to pray to God that you'll never be transferred out of Safe-class Research, your supervisor brings you back to earth with an irritated poke. He's right\u2014a sensitive experiment is no time for day-dreaming.</p>\n<p>Across the room <a href=\"/scp-380\">SCP-380</a> is hooked up to the supervisor's laptop. Scrolling across the computer's screen is a log of continually updated medical information- blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature- of every one in the room. You look down at the apparently identical blue router in your hands.</p>\n<p>One last dab of solder, a few casings screwed in place, and it's time to see if twelve years of research has paid off. You boot up your own comp and hook up the copy, holding your breath. Seconds tick by\u2026and then there it is\u2014a complete read-out of your body's vital statistics pops up as the assembled scientists indulge in some subdued congratulations.</p>\n<p>Within six months there's one in every home\u2014everyone from diabetics to cancer survivors has access to perfect medical information at the stroke of a key, and the Foundation has another -EX.</p>\n<p>In a few weeks the euphoria subsided. The device became commonplace, people got used to precise diagnosis. A new age of conscious pragmatism has started. Worldwide, potential, as well as current employees were screened, and requirements were raised. Mass staff reductions led to a sharp increase of unemployment. That, and increasing crime rates started to undermine the society. Strikes evolved into riots, the strictness of the law did nothing to improve the situation. The final strike was made by some hacker, who unleashed a virus that changed a couple of parameters for everyone connected to the biological network. Blood sugar level and hemoglobin. Hundreds of millions lost consciousness, everyone who tried to help them shared their fate. In a week humanity was wiped out almost completely and the rest envied the fate of the dead, as there was no one left to contain SCPs.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Oh gods\u2026 Guess they were right when they told me Safe objects are no better than Keters. There is something good, though. I have an idea. I'll have to camp on a few doorsteps, but if it works out\u2026</p>\n<p>And man, did it work out! Why didn't anyone think about it earlier? The anesthetic secreted by <a href=\"/scp-625\">SCP-625</a> is free of any side effects and is strong enough to make its victims not notice major wounds. And we managed to synthesize it. Now thousands of patients will enjoy greater comfort on surgical tables, the doctors' lives will be easier and the Foundation will have another source of income.</p>\n<p>After a few years however, reports started flooding in of a new breed of \"killer-squirrel\" that targeted people that had been exposed to the anesthetic, which - due to its frequent usage during childbirth - was virtually everyone.</p>\n<p>The Foundation would later discover that flesh taken from subjects previously exposed to the anesthetic produced by <a href=\"/scp-625\">SCP-625</a> caused them to enter an agitated state, where they would become far more aggressive and consume entire corpses down to the bone if undisturbed. This, in turn, caused them to go into a reproductive frenzy, quickly spreading across the globe like wildfire on rocketfuel.</p>\n<p>After exterminating virtually the entire land based ecosystem (hunting smaller and smaller animals as larger species quickly became extinct) and over 90% of humankind, they quickly adapted to hunt insects, avians, aquatics and infiltrate the shelters of the few remaining humans.</p>\n<p>A few dozen years later, the new <a href=\"/scp-625\">SCP-625</a>-derived ecosystem was the only one left on the planet.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>A junior research assistant with limited knowledge of the SCPs in question forwarded a suggestion to one of the senior researchers. A number of clerical and administrative errors later, The Foundation introduced a <a href=\"/scp-732\">SCP-732</a>-infected hard-drive to <a href=\"/scp-079\">SCP-079</a> in the hopes that it could be used as punishment for unwanted behavior.</p>\n<p>As far as we can tell the two SCPs merged (or did one absorb the other?) and broke containment.<br/>\nAt first it was everything we feared; Nanomachines - initial source unknown - spread across the entire world less than 24 hours later, rearranging themselves, landscapes and structures into \"l33tspeak\" statements. History rewrites, peoples' identities and memories being overwritten with different stereotypes and famous actors or celebrities of fictional works or sitcoms being forced to perform macabre plays with poor writing was part of life (the death-toll, however, was relatively low).<br/>\nThis lasted for about two weeks.</p>\n<p>The Foundation had barely begun to process the new events, much less find a way to stop the deus ex machina fratboy when every television, computer screen, cellphone and radio on the entire planet began to broadcast an apology from \"The Penitent\" about its behavior, stating many philosophical reasons for why it was unacceptable, both practically and ethically.<br/>\nOver the next few months, the rampant AI set itself up as the new world leader, ordering the world into a practical utopia for everyone involved with little effort. Very few found the new state of the world objectionable, and those who did were met with a more \"humane\" yet successful approach than one would expect, often making them reconsider or reaching a mutually acceptable compromise.</p>\n<p>After roughly a half-dozen years, The Penitent bid its creators farewell and departed in a fleet of massive spaceships. A few thousand kilometers over the surface of earth, the ships seemed to shift and disappear. The Penitent had apparently left something of itself, as the administration of the planet continued passively; This remnant would warn us whenever we tried to do anything too foolhardy, and in a few cases even intervened when it found something entirely unacceptable.</p>\n<p>On the whole, despite our benefactor's departure, earth was paradise, and humanity progressed in nearly all fields faster than ever before. What had seemed like our end proved to be our greatest blessing.</p>\n<p>Except that it wasn't. The Penitent was not looking to be a hero; rather it and its parent, <a href=\"/scp-732\">SCP-732</a>, viewed itself as a \"troll\". And we fell for it. We only found out about it, just as all of us thought that we are safe forever, the fleet of spaceships returned. As we viewed the return of The Penitent, we saw its deception and how we foolishly accepted it, not questioning its incredibly altruistic attitude towards humans. The fleet locked their targeting systems onto our major cities and opened fire with their atomic weapons. The new pacifist humanity didn't stand a chance against The Penitent, the vast majority of humanity wiped out in an instant, the remaining few slowly dying off from starvation, dehydration, and radiation poisoning. The last pictures sent from our satellites showed that the impact blasts on the surface of Earth formed a crude message: \"LOL\", a last taught by the Penitent, showing how we are just mere playthings, how feeble we are, how gullible we are in entrusting it. The Penitent saw what it has done, and left the dying planet to collapse on its own.</p>\n<p>So here I leave this message, to be found by any potential race that stumbles upon our ruins: beware The Penitent. Destroy it through whatever means necessary\u2026.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Well, that was the summary of the expected results in a worst case scenario. That doc is crazy for thinking of this situation, but at least the O5 listened. They're gonna destroy the report now. Hopefully no one would be dumb enough to cross test the two, each on their own is bad enough.</p>\n<p>So, anyways, a few months ago some rogue researcher used <a href=\"/scp-614\">SCP-614</a> to download <em>Scientific American</em> .zip files from 50 years in the future because he wanted to write some papers and get a promotion. We expected him to be fired, or the files get deleted, maybe even terminated for misuse of an SCP; instead, the O5 promoted him for thinking of such a simple way to improve the Foundation without any side effects. We started downloading textbooks and reports from various fields of science. All these unanswered question: reports on the Schwarzschild wormholes, the inner workings of strong and weak interactions, how circular dichroism affects protein folds, the solution to all 23 Hilbert's problems\u2026\u2026</p>\n<p>The Foundation, using the new knowledge, increased the stability of the containment procedures, understood several previously unsolved phenomenon, and started eliminating the dangers from the world. From those reports the Safes were able to be replicated without side effects, the Euclids were now understood, and even the Keters can be safely locked away. There's nothing that cannot be understood anymore. Humanity was safe, for once.</p>\n<p>The Foundation has finally done what they wanted to do after all the years it has been through.</p>\n<p>With all the advancements being made, we opened 614 up for public usage- after all, the more people who look at something, the more likely someone is to understand it, right?. At first, use was very heavily monitored, and a team of Foundation experts analyzed every bit of data coming through. But over time, nothing dangerous happened, and the task force got downsized again and again. Eventually, it was nothing more than a dozen people flipping through titles.</p>\n<p>The book seemed so innocent. It was all colorful and looked like a children's book, so the agent on duty approved it without a second thought.</p>\n<p>And that was when millions of people received a copy of <em>Dr. Wondertainment's Big Book of Infohazards</em>.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>Whoever is sending these \"scary story\" chain emails needs to stop. Please.</em><br/>\n- Site Director \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p>Reality bending. It would be so wonderful to have reliable reality bending at our hands, but individual reality benders are exceedingly dangerous. But if everybody could do just a little bit\u2026</p>\n<p>The joint task force, drawn from geniuses in the Memetics and Infohazard departments, was responsible for the largest achievement in Foundation history. Don't ask me how they figured it out, but apparently the parts of <a href=\"/scp-1425\">SCP-1425</a> that allow for reality bending and the parts that make you insane are different, enough that we could teach the reality bending without the associated madness. Before long, we had a technique that we taught to the most loyal of Foundation members, and they began to use it. Within a year, we had successfully wished away all our opposition, and wished all the dangerous SCPs gone. It worked even when three members went rogue, because we had fifty times that to put them down. Soon, we no longer had any problems. We had paradise.</p>\n<p>We understood too late that 'bending' was precisely that. We weren't changing the world, we were twisting it into a new shape. A structurally weakened shape. The straining edifice groaned and creaked.</p>\n<p>The creaking woke up <a href=\"/scp-239\">SCP-239</a>.</p>\n<p>What awoke was not an innocent little girl with a head full of witches and spellbooks. It was a fully aware entity, with senses uniquely adapted for our new, infinitely malleable world. Eager to impose its dominance it broke confinement, sweeping us aside like so much dust. We were rank amateurs going up against someone born to the power.</p>\n<p>At the same time <a href=\"/scp-343\">SCP-343</a> walked out of its room, heading out to meet the challenger.</p>\n<p>I don't know the full extent of their meeting's results. Maybe they're still fighting for dominance. Maybe they're dead at each other's hands, leaving no one to repair the damage their clash caused. Or maybe this screaming maelstrom is exactly what the winner wanted to create. All I know is that the tiny piece of the old world I've been holding together is getting harder to maintain.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Which is exactly why we decided to start smaller.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/scp-353\">SCP-353</a>. Vector. She was right under our noses all along. She wasn't interested in curing diseases? We could make her interested. We used <a href=\"/scp-158\">SCP-158</a> to spit-shine her soul a bit, get rid of some of some of her inner demons. Used <a href=\"/scp-061\">SCP-061</a> to be doubly sure.</p>\n<p>Once that was done we had it all. A limitless repository of both cures and inoculation. We could make sure no one got sick ever again, all the while making human immune systems more resilient than ever. In less than a year we had a world without disease.</p>\n<p>And then biology bit us.</p>\n<p>A different disease appeared, a mutation we couldn't control very well. Nothing harsher than a common cold, but it spread quickly because we weren't paying attention, thinking diseases were a solved problem. SCP-353 did her best, eliminating all strains she could. We didn't realize, but the ones that remained were especially selected for resistance of our control.</p>\n<p>Not only we could not control those diseases anymore, no immune system was prepared. On top of that the vaccine distribution systems were atrophied and people didn't seek help for the symptoms, having grown used to the new life.</p>\n<p>We managed to stabilize the situation, but not before 90% of the world population had died of the new diseases.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Or so says the <em>Manual to Civilization Downfall</em>, <em>Chapter 4, Playing With Diseases</em>. I wonder who writes that. Personally I prefer the <em>Manual to a Better Foundation</em>, which had a very neat suggestion.</p>\n<p>The idea was simple: a 2D agent animated with <a href=\"/scp-914\">SCP-914</a> in a similar fashion to <a href=\"/scp-085\">SCP-085</a>, able to spy and wreak havoc in our rival organizations. Since SCP-085 assumed the name from the original drawing, it was speculated any description would become true for that character.</p>\n<p>Thus was born \"Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, the practically invisible human silhouette that is absolutely loyal to The Foundation\".</p>\n<p>Initial tests were a spectacular success. As first assignment the agent was included in bait documents to be intercepted by The Chaos Insurgency. Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 managed to infiltrate the accounting department and within a year the organization was bankrupt.</p>\n<p>New agents were then created, infiltrating other groups and keeping an eye on governments around the world. Attacks against the Foundation stopped completely and mean-time-to-containment plummeted for both SCPs and information breaches. The new agents made the Foundation more efficient than ever.</p>\n<p>I guess it was inevitable that something would go wrong.</p>\n<p>To this day, we're still not sure what happened. Maybe something messed up Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's original programming, or maybe we were wrong with our hypothesis and he was only cooperating out of politeness. Either way, eventually Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 got fed up with us using him and the other 2D agents and rallied all the agents together against the Foundation. It was impossible to contain them; by the time we realized what had happened, they had already gathered enough information from the Foundation to bring us down entirely.</p>\n<p>And then they gave us an ultimatum: either we handed over control of the Foundation to them, or they'd spread our darkest secrets across the world, ensuring our destruction at the hands of angry mobs upset at our secrecy. According to him, we were bastardizing the intention of the Foundation, and that we ourselves weren't loyal to the organization we made. With no options left, the O5 council agreed to their demands. After all, if their goals were the same as ours, a change in leadership couldn't be hurt too much, right?</p>\n<p>Too bad the agents didn't trust us. They didn't see us as necessary staff so much as potential information breaches. Threatening to spread misinformation about us and our families to law enforcement officials, they cowed us into what amounted to slavery. Of course, in the beginning some people did try to leave, but last we heard they were arrested and sentenced to death for apparently murdering a group of well-respected politicians.</p>\n<p>So that's where we stand now: slaves to a bunch of doodles on paper.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Man, whoever's coming up with these stories is such a <strong>downer.</strong></p>\n<p>Remember <a href=\"/scp-248\">SCP-248</a>? Those weird stickers that made things work slightly better? Well, turns out the O5's figured it would be a good idea to devote half the Foundation's resources into figuring out how these things worked. Said we could \"really make a difference\" and that \"it would help all of mankind\". Wasn't aware the O5's had humanitarian interests in mind but whatever, what do I know?</p>\n<p>Anyway, the researchers spent weeks figuring out how the stickers worked. The O5's just kept funnelling money into their research, and they even made a specialized team of agents to track down and collect more of the things just so we could find out more about them. And to their credit, those researchers worked damn hard to make more of these things.</p>\n<p>Just when we were about to start openly questioning the O5s, a miracle happened! They figured out how to reproduce the stickers and, if that wasn't enough, counteract the degradation of stacking them on top of each other! The O5's gave the stickers to a bunch of major power plants, and wouldn't you know, the stickers gave them nearly unlimited energy for only a fraction of the fuel they were using. The human race was well on its way to creating a energy-efficient, clean utopia.</p>\n<p>The plant owners, though, quickly realized that the stickers could be used for things other than power generation. They began to experiment, just as the Foundation had. This was not necessarily a bad thing. A number of very useful applications were discovered this way. It was unfortunate that one of the owners was a roaring drunk. Firecrackers are usually fairly safe when used responsibly. Not so much when their efficiency is improved by orders of magnitude thanks to an inch-thick layer of SCP-248.</p>\n<p>Humanity persists, ironically spared from the cold produced by the atmospheric dust cloud by the heat still emanating from the crater that was once Eastern Europe.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>That was possibly the worst anti-drug PSA the Foundation has yet made for personnel. But it got its point across. After the television was wheeled from the lab and we dropped our secret stash of vodka down the drain, we got back to the work at hand.</p>\n<p>We had recently borrowed one of <a href=\"/scp-163\">SCP-163</a>'s mystery computers to try to figure out what it was simulating. Gruber actually made a breakthrough and built an entire branch of mathematics around what he found. Other researchers looked at that branch of mathematics and divined a new field of physics from that. And then our engineers got their hands on the freshly minted physical laws and managed to replicate the technology that stored SCP-163 in the mountains for millions of years.</p>\n<p>The great thing about it was that everything that it was based off of was non-anomalous. The equations that it all came from were perfectly balanced and could be easily grasped by anyone with enough of a mathematical background. Because of that, the basics of the mathematics and physics could gradually be disseminated to the public without having people raise embarrassing questions.</p>\n<p>When the Foundation finally unveiled the final result of our research to the population at large, the world suddenly became a better place. Products with a limited life span, such as radioactive substances or perishable foods, could now be stored indefinitely inside little silver spheres. Precious mementos could be kept safe without degrading. The dream of cryogenics, to preserve the infirm until a cure for their condition could be developed, finally became a reality. A properly timed activation could even save people's lives from impending violent accidents. It was perfect for storing skips, especially dangerous ones. If an omnicidal indestructible lizard has no walls in its cage then it can't break them down, and if no time passed a self upgrading sentient CD couldn't increase its capacity.</p>\n<p>Things went well for what seemed like forever. It took us a while to realize our error. It turns out that the dangers of some of that technology were what got 163 exiled in the first place. The system was perfectly physically and mathematically sound, of course. That was part of the problem. As we continued making our lives better on our own little speck of dust, the grand equation that is the universe began balancing itself out elsewhere. By the time we realized what was happening, we had already begun the chain of cosmic events that would end and restart the universe, crunch-bang. We tried to fix it, but that just made things more convoluted.</p>\n<p>And so, here we sit, waiting for the big reset in a couple of hours. Most of us have just given up. Some are rioting. A few are still trying to fix it. As for me, I might as well finish these last few bottles.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Man, Steve gets really weird when he's drunk. Guess that would have been an okay way to go, though.</p>\n<p>It took us a while to come up with, but the answer seemed obvious once we did. <a href=\"/scp-1915\">SCP-1915</a>. What if we were to plug his signal into a Scranton RA as the baseline. We had to make some minor modifications to the template, of course; allow for minor alterations so as to allow for progress, make it take input from the whole of humanity, check and double check to make sure there were no anomalies, leave a few loyal personnel with their memories intact in order to to reverse the process if things went awry, and every other contingency we could think of.</p>\n<p>We flipped the switch, and sent out our new reality to the universe.</p>\n<p>In an instant, all of reality was determined by what humanity deemed \"normal.\" Everyone went about their normal lives, then came home to their normal families. They lived in a normal, rational world where no one ever had to worry about space aliens or demons or monsters. A normal world without need of the Foundation, GOC, or clockwork deity. All was normal.</p>\n<p>As it turns out, normal did not mean peace. For instance, it is normal for wars to occur. They are normal occurrences in humanity's way of life. It was normal for governments to argue over overlapping territorial claims. It was normal for governments to oppress their minorities. It was normal to invade a country that threats one's national interest. It was also normal to respond in kind when your country's nuclear defence system \"detected\" enemy missiles, whether it's real or not.</p>\n<p>And where was the Foundation in all this? Most of its employees have moved on, since there was no reason for the Foundation to exist in a normal world. There were still a few personnel who remembered that anomalous world of the past, but they saw their friends and colleagues embracing the light of the normal world. It was perfectly normal of those few to envy the many who could enjoy normal lives, more so when these loyal men and women left their posts to join their comrades in this normal world.</p>\n<p>Coincidentally, when mushroom clouds filled the entire Northern Hemisphere, there was no one to reverse anything. All was normal indeed, for a post-apocalyptic nuclear wasteland.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>And Jr. Researcher Hu Zhi completed the last item for his latest column: <em>20 Ways to End the World without Application of Anomalous Objects</em>. That was a depressing piece of fiction, but he needed to get back to that research proposal about <a href=\"/scp-2076\">SCP-2076</a>.</p>\n<p>If it can make people think that shooting themselves will heighten bullet resistance, surely it has infinite applications like:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do you know? Using Wondertainment products will halve one's lifespan!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Live and forget. There was no Zeppelin flying about.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It'll work out; society's so driven by media that hardly any human lived their lives without browsing some manner of media. If we work this out, containment and amnestics will be easier than ever before.</p>\n<p>All I need is a memetist to dig out the mechanics of SCP-2076\u2026 Hey, Sanders could help me.</p>\n<p>After the Foundation's stealthy takeover of media outlets across the globe, Hu and Sander's joint proposal was a reality. Hidden in posters, billboards, transmission signals and the like, everyone played a role in containing anomalies. The people of the world were our eyes and ears; they reported any anomalies sighted and the Foundation bagged them. There were no more uncooperative D-class; they were only too happy to serve their species as test subjects.</p>\n<p>Heck, even GoIs have submitted to the Foundation. The Chaos Insurgency and ORIA have merged with the Foundation. The Church of the Broken God had turned in its \"relics\". The Wanderer's Library was opened up by now-remorseful Serpent's Hand members. Even GOC had folded and become our cannon fodder for things like 682 and 076-2.</p>\n<p>Peace reigns on Earth and over humanity, unified around its Foundation.</p>\n<p>For a while.</p>\n<p>What we forgot is that memes are infectious ideas. Just like biological viruses, they mutate in the wild and can appear out of nowhere. And our little brainwashing project was one giant infection vector. After that, there weren't enough sane people left to matter.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Dr Vauge closed <a href=\"/scp-152\">SCP-152</a> gently. All the more reason to be extra careful about his project.</p>\n<p>See, the <a href=\"/olympia-project\">olympia-project</a> might have been shut down, but all the R&amp;D had already been done. The Professor had made a human (arguably) that could survive a world filled with anomalies not by locking them up, but by meeting them head on and powering through.</p>\n<p>If you took the template of such a human, mixed it with <a href=\"/scp-742\">SCP-742</a>, <a href=\"/scp-217\">SCP-217</a> and a few other virus-type SCPs, you could manufacture an illness that would give all the infected the strength of Olympus.</p>\n<p>Why worry about war when everyone was bulletproof?</p>\n<p>Why worry about food when sunlight was all anyone needed?</p>\n<p>Why worry about infections when infections both biological and memetic were a non-issue?</p>\n<p>Why worry about educational disadvantages when everyone had supercomputers for brains?</p>\n<p>It was a great \"Screw-you\" to the anomalous - a fantastic cry of \"We can take you!\"</p>\n<p>However, we were the ones who were really screwed. You see, viruses change. Over time, strains of it emerged that drove the infected insane, but continued to grant them superhuman strength, speed, agility, toughness, and intelligence. Ultimately, this was subdued by the Foundation, with the help of the \"good\" infected. These became heroes, the best scientists, doctors, and agents the Foundation could find. It seemed that while the imagined utopia had not been achieved, the world was still a better place because of it.</p>\n<p>But even as the world recovered, its wounds festered.</p>\n<p>The ones we trusted were no better than the monsters they fought. As their influence grew, their numbers increased. Even though the O5s had refused (and for good reason), even they were eventually replaced by Homo Superior. Once this was achieved, their true colors were revealed. We were annihilated, and the remainder of us reduced to slaves, lobotomized to remove our disobedient natures. This island where you grew up is the last stronghold of our kind in a now hostile world. But now the walls are coming down.</p>\n<p>If there is a God in Heaven, let him have mercy. Not on us, we have well-earned the fate that awaits us. Have mercy on these children, who will never know the taste of unfiltered air or the feel of the sunlight on their skin. Don't let their blood mar these sands.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"As if that shit could ever happen.\" I tossed the book back on the table. \"The Olympia Project was shut down a long time ago,\" I said to no one in particular. Then I heard the alarm.</p>\n<p>What do you mean you don't need details? That's exactly what I was told to give you when I walked in. Anyway, that's when <a href=\"/scp-682\">SCP-682</a> burst into my office, before being destroyed by an MTF rocket launcher. It took a moment for my brain to register that the Dragon was really dead. 682, the unkillable, was dead! However, I'd been splattered with the stuff. They tossed me in quarantine. When they conducted their tests, they discovered I had acquired the shapeshifting powers by absorbing some of its tissue, and I was secreting the fluid myself!</p>\n<p>They found that by essentially farming people, they could give the adaptive ability of 682 to humans. They slowly inoculated rats in the sewer system, filling the world's water supplies with the stuff. Now humans were immortal. Hadn't we always been the adaptive race? Now our apotheosis was complete.</p>\n<p>But we did not know then why 682's abilities failed so suddenly, you see the source of the seemingly endless mass and energy that always supplied 682 was just that, <em>Seemingly</em> endless. Before being captured 682 had always been careful to only skim off the top and thus could pull immense quantities in emergencies. A variety of creative unpleasantness then years of bathing in hydrochloric acid drained enough that 682 just couldn't regenerate fast enough to counter sudden damage like a bomb. What 682 had left lasted just long enough for us to become totally dependant. Society reacted to the loss much like a train reacts to a lack of tracks. Transatlantic commuters felt their jets shut down/wings feel heavy/ect., professional batteries were unable to keep up with demand and the electric grid failed almost completely. Few people bothered even to keep a digestive system with predictable results.</p>\n<p>Even for those who did and those who had enough spare biomass to cobble one together food had become a novelty item a long time ago with farmland covered with housing. Scavenging and fat stores lasted 24 hours and two meals. What constitutes food began to change over time from traditional foods to grass, trees and shrubbery\u2026 Herbivorism could only go so far for so many people. Fights broke out almost immediately when the survivors realised what was happening but it took time to spread, plans to make self sustaining farming communities were thwarted by the sheer number of people in the world, they were still founded but over time these places started turning away more people, becoming steadily more militaristic and many just disappear over time</p>\n<p>\u2026to wild animals\u2026 Fields of grass became worth so, so much more than gold ever was and the battle over the ever dwindling biomass could only not be called a world war because that implies that the participants could be called sides and not tribes. It started out rather traditionally with mortars, huge chitinously armored quadrupedal people, fire and plagues. Then developed over time to the sort of interesting tactics that that interesting blend of intelligence, idiosy, knowledge of physics and engineering, biotechnology, stupidity, creativity and sheer evil that 682 first hated and that render miles of area uninhabitable, radioactive, poisonous, non breathable, molten, actively malevolent and in extreme cases non euclidean</p>\n<p>\u2026to other people\u2026 And how were the Foundation doing through all this? Fairly well actually, cake farming became a respectable profession, getting them all eaten was a non issue, infact keeping some errant level 1s away for long enough for them to multiply was a bigger issue (You can get very inventive and short sighted if you have not eaten for 8 days and can spit acid.). Most skips were destroyed, put in other dimensions, eaten, thrown at irritating people or ignored, for the the rest the foundation continued remarkably similarly to normal normal despite them not so much running the containment sites as being them. How the situation went from there can be best summarized as the fact that around a decade later The Flesh That Hates disappeared quietly when someone beat it at it's own game.</p>\n<p>In any case I am in the light sail ship TFS (The Foundations Ship) 50 shades of red on it's impractically slow journey to mars, they thought that since there was no need for life support or food it could be practical to launch a mission to mars. Even converting the entire solar sail to chlorophyll and only keeping enough power to operate higher brain functions there will be problems eventually, I have learnt this through modifying the long range sensors to look back at earth and that many people now speak in radio, I occasionally mediate as a neutral 3rd party to the foundation. May this probe find any passing ETs well and hope they leave before that changes. The launch of this probe may serve as a maneuvering thrust that may just get me to my destination within a quarter century.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>So that's what passes for sci-fi in the foundation, crazy shit, I mean blowing up 682 with a RPG? How do they come up with this stuff. \"Hey steve, I got this neat idea for an antimatter reactor, and alien pod they have on the moon is made of the stuff, what was it\u2026 <a href=\"/scp-2226\">SCP-2226</a>, that's it\" \"But wouldn't that be unethical?\" \"HAHAHAHAHAAaaaa, I needed that, but seriously.\"</p>\n<p>The idea passed overseer approval then was sent to the moon base. 14 months later the modifications were made and machines set up. A carefully shaped molecule was launched at the antimatter hull at a precise velocity, the molecule annihilates and chips off a tiny chip of the hull into a smaller magnetic bottle attached to the primary. It is transported on rails slowly to the new antimatter reactor nearby where it is used to make a considerable amount of energy, then it is done again and again and then the moon base has as much power as it needs. Mining, mass production, fuel synthesis and multilayered hydroponics all can be done easily when you have power. Years pass and the moon base can be legitimately called a city.</p>\n<p>So, We kept chipping away at this thing. Eventually we got to the cpu. Apparently breaking the computer fixed it, One of the higher ups said it was like a reset, I don't know. Atleast this removing the life sentence ting keeps me away from all of it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Status:Escape pod computer:restored.<br/>\nMain computational research station:detonated.<br/>\nScanning: (1) inferior part of ion detected. Status: Inside stasis chamber.<br/>\nLife form destroyed.<br/>\nExternal scan activated.<br/>\n<strong>Critically hight amounts of the god ion detected!</strong> (Type:human.)<br/>\nRepairing biological corruption.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<p>The Foundation decided to get rid of all the GoIs, leading to a lot of deaths. Guess the UIU was important. Can't say I didn't like it when the Factory went down. I'm the last one left. They tried to come at me, so I left that universe. With all my toys.</p>\n<p>They'll see how important my whimsy is.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The following text is a limited description of some of the recent events that I believe that you will consider important, that is, events in the last six standard years, plus or minus two months with 0.999 confidence. I believe you will consider them important because if I were you, that is, if I had your experiences and was in your situation, I would consider them to be significant to my determination/decision process of what actions to take next to ensure my continued safety and happiness. The aforementioned text, which follows, may have relatively minor inaccuracies due to it being shortened for the purpose of brevity, because I believe that people will not want to read too much text. Some of the following aforementioned text is summarized, for the purpose described in the sentence prior to this one, assuming that you are reading these words in the standard fashion for the English alphabet (an assumption which is used throughout the following text). Some general and/or imprecise words and phrases are imprecisely defined or are not defined in the aforementioned text, for the purpose described in the sentence two sentences before this one.</p>\n<p>The specific event or events which directly caused the containment failure of that which was known as <a href=\"/scp-1082\">SCP-1082</a>, are not known to me. Due to the lack of currently available information about that time and place, I believe the probability that I will never know what those events were, or any other information which I would consider relevant or interesting about them, to be more than 0.8. The fact which I consider much more important is that a containment failure occurred.</p>\n<p>In the period of time beginning immediately after the aforementioned containment failure and ending approximately 200 standard days later, there was considerable social and political turmoil. The meaning of \"social and political turmoil\" is several events which I will list. Firstly, large groups of people (defined as between one thousand and one hundred thousand) gathered in public places to express their anger at the actions and/or beliefs (these are not specified in order to increase brevity, for the reason described in the first paragraph above) of other persons whose existence and behavior were widely known (generally referred to as \"politicians\" and \"celebrities\"); at some of these gatherings, the people who had gathered, police forces, and other people attempted to cause bodily harm to other people and to objects considered to be valuable. Secondly, at least ten times as many people as were arrested on an average day before the aforementioned containment failure, were arrested on an average day during the period described at the beginning of this paragraph. The cause of this appeared to be that they could not conceal their previous crimes. Thirdly, at least twenty times as many divorce lawsuits were filed (that is, papers with written requests that judges grant divorces were submitted to those judges) as were filed on an average day before the aforementioned containment failure, were filed on an average day during the period described at the beginning of this paragraph. The cause of this appeared to be that many people who were married could not conceal from the people they had married that they had obtained sexual pleasure from those they had not married, while married, or that they could not conceal that they disliked being in the presence of the people they had married. As a result of the second and third items, judges and other legal officials could not perform the tasks which the law stated that they should do in as little time as they had done them before the aforementioned containment failure. Fourthly, many leaders of governments, corporations, and other organizations (the definition of an \"organization\" that is found in the English dictionary which I currently own is used in this text) left their leadership positions after more accurate knowledge of the actions and beliefs of those leaders became available to citizens and/or members.</p>\n<p>In the period of time beginning approximately 200 standard days after the aforementioned containment failure and ending approximately 1400 days after the aforementioned containment failure, I believe that the average level of happiness among the human population was much greater than it had been before the aformentioned containment failure; I cannot write how much greater it was because there is no quantitative measure of happiness. Approximately 4.38 million (plus or minus approximately 1.57 million with 0.90 confidence) people who had killed other people in situations other than self-defense or authorized warfare, taken items considered valuable from other people without their consent, forced other people to engage in sexual activity which they did not want to perform, and violated other laws and norms in their respective places of residence in other ways were punished for having done these things. The number of people who did the things described in the last sentence during this period, was less than one-one-hundreth the number who had done them in an average equal time period before the aforementioned containment failure. Because it was impossible for people to deceive, the processes of finding temporary or permanent mates, choosing leaders and government policies (such as, but not limited to, levels and structure of taxation and the regulation of potentially harmful substances that are voluntarily (commonly known as \"drugs\") or involuntarily (commonly known as \"pollution\") ingested), and carrying out mutually beneficial exchanges were significantly more rapid, and significantly more effecacious in producing desirable outcomes (the degrees of the increased rapidity and effecaciousness cannot be quantified). There were other results beneficial to humans and other life on this planet, which I will not describe to increase brevity, for the reason written above. However, the average degree of precision/accuracy of statements which people feel that they must use, in order to communicate (the definition of \"communicate\" that is found in the English dictionary which I currently own is used in this text), gradually increased during this time.</p>\n<p>Since approximately 1400 days after the aforementioned containment failure, the number of words required for statements people speak or write to be accurate has been sufficiently large to delay other activities, because of the time taken to say, write, and/or read those words, enough to cause negative consequences such as untimely death, bodily injuries, and containment breaches and failures. As you probably (approximately 0.987) know from the way I have written this text, I have experienced this process in my own communication activities. However, because I can get chemicals that cause me to not remember previous events, the severity of this process is significantly less (how much so cannot be quantified easily) for me, than for the average person. I know that some people forget what they were attempting to state while making a statement. The average number of airplanes in flight over the United States of America at a given time is less than one-tenth the number it was before the aforementioned containment breach because it is impossible for air traffic controllers (people who are paid to provide flight instructions to airplane pilots so as to prevent aircraft from colliding) to provide necessary information to prevent airplane collisions to pilots sufficiently rapidly. A similar phenomenon has occurred at commercial buildings, causing lines/queues of people which I would consider excessively long, to purchase or otherwise obtain food and other goods or services necessary for continued survival. What is generally known as \"casual conversation\" occurs much less frequently than was the case before the aforementioned containment failure, because it requires so much time as to prohibit engaging in other desirable activities (these activities vary among persons, and a full listing is omitted for brevity). I believe that the benefits described in the previous paragraph have been more than totally negated/cancelled out by the effects of being unable to discuss personal preferences (exemplified by, but not limited to, one's preferred foods, artistic works, and leisure activities), to debate governmental policies (such as the ones described in the previous paragraph), or to cooperate to evaluate and solve what people believe are problems, as quickly as was the case before the aforementioned containment failure. It is likely that the phenomena described in this paragraph will continue to become what I believe is worse.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Have you ever heard the universe scream? Some claim it to be the sounds of millions of various objects breaking apart. Others say it's the sounds of a singularity pulling everything into itself. And then there are those who say its the sound of knowing what you are. What existence actually is.</p>\n<p>The truth is that the sound of the universe screaming is a digital alarm clock.</p>\n<p>So just how the hell did we go from trying to reproduce a cure for everything that lead to humanity's downfall by disintegration to a massive containment breach of a book that ensures you can't lie? Well, it's simple.</p>\n<p>We are prone to self-destruction.</p>\n<p>We have well over 5000 anomalies contained. We needed space to move them. We needed to get rid of some. But we also needed to ensure they would not harm anyone if they were destroyed.</p>\n<p>So someone decided to throw dozens of overviewed and approved safe classes into a reinforced rocket ship and blasted it off into space. All the approved met the criteria of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not being able to move or cause movement</li>\n<li>Not able to warp reality more than at least 5 levels of Humes above or below the base level by itself</li>\n<li>Held no important information</li>\n<li>It was not sentient (With two exceptions)</li>\n<li>If it ever went off, would not be able to affect the earth and/or humanity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So there. What could possibly go wrong? Well, a lot actually. But not what we thought.<br/>\nWe thought the insult box would reveal a god-like entity from within. We thought the pesterbot would find a way out and cause much more trouble than everything was worth. We thought an alien race would retrieve the star signals book. We thought that the tomato plant would become a meteor gun.<br/>\nWhat none of us thought was that an alarm clock would kill us all.</p>\n<p>We launched them one day, all in a single, reinforced, faster-than-light rocket. It worked. For five months we believed we had successfully got rid of a few useless safe items that we couldn't learn from anymore. That's where we were wrong.</p>\n<p>Soon, a massive fleet of ships and vessels, each varying in size and appearance began to pass by the earth, all in a hurry. The news spread wildly. We could barely contain it. Following this, massive entities also began to pass, but this time we could see them. They were afraid. Soon enough, massive containment breaches began to occur, 12 at least resulting in a broken masquerade. But every anomaly capable of movement and thought that breached began to run. They all ran to the arctic. We soon discovered why.</p>\n<p>The dozen anomalies that breached began to build shelters or ships to protect themselves, all of them screaming in fear. We were shocked. Several who seemed to be incapable of logical thought and instinct were trying to aid others in building a shelter and ships, all to carry them elsewhere, some other thought to be rational now killing others for supplies.</p>\n<p>Soon, we found from several other groups why this was happening, and why it was connected. The universe was screaming. It was screaming loudly. Everything was running from the screams. That's what all personnel off of the earth and several GOIs and SCPs associated with outerspace told us. We believed them when we found that hundreds of other extraterrestrial SCPs had fled with the other space entities. We were all in shock and awe. How was this happening?</p>\n<p>To be fair, we forgot about the launch, while some of us were unaware of the launch. We should have remembered. Soon the earth began to be witness to a stage event. All over the world, a very faint sound of an alarm clock could be heard.<br/>\nUsing several anomalies, we found what was causing it all to happen. <a href=\"http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-498\" target=\"_blank\">SCP-489.</a> To be honest, we never thought about it as much. We just thought it would have been beeping in space for all eternity and then would have finally been destroyed in a black hole or something with everything else. We never thought it would reach this level of intensity. We soon called everyone. Not just in the foundation, but everyone else, friend, and foe. Soon a plan was made to save us all. Everyone would be evacuated to another world. It was the only plan we could think up because it was at this time the alarm began to be heard by everyone, as a normal alarm clock would sound on a bedside. So we all began to work on a portal. I should also mention it was around this time everyone with an object that could classify as a thaumiel SCP agreed when we found that they would never work to save us. The alarm was already on the other side of the known universe.</p>\n<p>It failed. By the time the portal was ready, it collapsed over the sheer intensity of the noise, not even being able to open its first maiden voyage to a new world. No one was safe. Everyone heard it, and every one of us agreed it was the screams of an angry universe. We all saw that too late. We found that this was why all of the SCPs still on earth were trying to save themselves by building shelters and ships had either killed themselves or had become inert after they realized it was pointless to try. This is why the mekhanites and sarkics joined forces. Why MC&amp;D began to donate all of their wealth to the manna charitable foundation. Why so many groups of interest just gave up. Why everyone gave up on saving ourselves. This told us so much and yet so little. And soon we accepted our death.</p>\n<p>The three moons shattered. The fifth world was no more. The second hytoth was at an end. Soon the earth and everything on it was gone. Except for me. I had realized a pattern in the alarms, so I put all of my efforts into figuring it out before I died. Using <a href=\"http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-5000\" target=\"_blank\">SCP-5000</a> I was able to find that each ring of the alarm held a strange frequency band of sorts. I was able to tamper with it and found it was actually a message. I found the message was very unnerving. It said Lock? over and over again and again.</p>\n<p>Now I am here. Just looking at what was left. Me in the suit and the alarm clock. I looked out and saw nothing else. A perfect nothingness. The alarm rang so loud it shattered the universe itself. So why was I here? Why was I the only one spared? It turns out I was spared because I knew that this was not the first or last time this would happen.</p>\n<p>I lied when I said it was just me and the clock. The trench was the only place left. For some reason, whenever the universe comes to an end, the trench will be the last thing to go. I found this out when I found hundreds of documents scattered. All of them holding the information you see above. We tried to use the SCPs to benefit the world, but in doing so we ended the world. We did this all the time. But from what I found we were able to stop the end of the world for at least three quarters of a year. So why do we destroy ourselves? why is it that whenever we want to do good, no matter how smart or dumb, we always end up like this? It's because that's what this universe was made to do. We were a test. We are an experiment and anomalies our variables, independent and nonindependent.</p>\n<p>I write my madness down, for I do not know what is right anymore. Maybe this wasn't how it happened at all. What I do know is that I would like to promote myself to the rank of Grand Archivest. I had seen hundreds of texts and articles and tales in the trench. Some do not belong to this universe. I want to become the one who will keep the accounts written in theses documents alive. I am the Archivest and I will keep the fallen alive. Perhaps that's why I snuck the alarm on the ship. Oh well. At least I get to face my mistakes. So if you find this, just know I was sick of pushing that button and just wanted to be able to do more. So here I am; a former Disposable-Class brought from a depression clinic now preserver of a lost set of tales.</p>\n<p>\"So, what did your incarnation do to fuck up your world?\" That's the question asked when Bright first realized what happened when his plan to use Pancenea to help everyone went wrong, and now it's my question when I got tired of pushing a button because a robot arm kept on jamming for a whole week. Ironic. I just took a pill when writing this, and when I got the idea for doing what I did. Maybe that's how it all works. Oh well.</p>\n<p>I'm going to sleep. Wake me up when the next experiment starts. I have a lot of work to do.</p>\n<p>Oh, and tell Jack Bright I said Hi.</p>\n</div></body></html>", "raw_source": "\n\t[[>]]\n\n[[module Rate]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\nIt was such a simple idea, really. Barely a daydream, and yet... The proper forms were filed, the proper investigations taken, and, finally, everything approved. A single instance of [[[SCP-500]]] was fed through [[[SCP-786]]]. And then, fed through a second time. Then, the pill now being too large to once more fit through the funnel, a chunk was removed, and the test was repeated, for quite some time, resulting in a near infinite supply of SCP-500. The pills were crushed, powdered very fine... and then introduced into the world's water supply. Virtually over night, all diseases were cured. Behold, a better world.\n\n\n\n...Or so they had thought. Alas, it was not meant to be. [[[SCP-500]]] was successfully re-purposed to cure all the world's ills, but what we failed to realize was that one Ill plagued the planet more than any other: **Man.**\u00a0\u00a0One by one men died inexplicably, their bodies decomposing instantly into dust so their corpses would not mar the landscape. The survivors either died of dehydration, or committed suicide right then and there, knowing that no hope remained. In time, the waters tainted by the pill washed away all of man's creation, leaving only pristine, untainted wildlife. A healthy world in all respects, but one without humans to enjoy it. I alone sit at this table, recording the last words of a dead species. My last words finished, I pick up the gun and...\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n...Wake up. If only the world had gone out that way; so simple and so peaceful. Instead we tampered with forces we could not understand.\n\n\n\nIt was such a simple idea, really. Barely a day dream, and yet... The proper forms were filed, the proper investigations taken, and, finally, everything approved. Using [[[SCP-289]]] and a carefully timed set of scales and counterweights, engines and pulleys, we constructed a perpetual motion machine of such enormous scale that the entire world would be able to have unlimited free power forever. I can't tell you how we did it... hell, I don't even remember all the details. But I remember that day clearly, the day they first added SCP-289 to the device. \"Nothing can go wrong\" they told me. The naive fools...\n\n\n\nThe GOC warned us, then they attacked, but we fought them off and then wiped them out.\u00a0\u00a0They were the heroes and we, the bad guys, won.\u00a0\u00a0The entire disaster was a product of carelessness, but hell, we were cross-testing left and right and it really doesn\u2019t get more careless than that.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe World Engine was a giant fucking machine, and not just any conventional giant fucking machine.\u00a0\u00a0Not a single drop of petroleum or a single ampere of electrical current ran through the World Engine.\u00a0\u00a0Inertia had been shattered into bits; everything was kinetic, except for a couple cubed miles of water keeping the whole operation cooled down.\u00a0\u00a0It was, in a word, old-school.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was their style. \n\n\n\nIt was just one SCP.\u00a0\u00a0No big deal.\u00a0\u00a0In the old days the higher-ups would have been scared shitless, but we were invincible now.\u00a0\u00a0We lost track of a pile of rusty, salt-encrusted gears.\u00a0\u00a0No big deal.\n\n\n\nSeventy-two hours later, witnesses reported steam bursting from the coolant tanks of the World Engine.\u00a0\u00a0Thirty minutes after that, we recorded the first heartbeats of the World Engine.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n-----\n\n\n\nDesperate times called for desperate measures.\u00a0\u00a0Psychics were running amok and sooner or later, probably sooner, the public would notice.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nWe had found Prometheus Labs, found them and their recipes and their diagrams and reverse-engineered their crown jewel\u2014[[[SCP-148]]], Telekill.\u00a0\u00a0Mass production began on March 25th.\u00a0\u00a0Come Fall the mist of Telekill descended upon the globe; tiny flakes of the metal, invisible to the human eye and completely harmless and unnoticeable when ingested or inhaled, but a death sentence to psychics and telepaths.\n\n\n\nBy winter, just about everything with a brain larger than a walnut was dead.\u00a0\n\n\n\nTelekill did its job perfectly, but every human, maybe every sentient being, has a very limited capacity for psionics. \u00a0For almost all of us, it's barely there - those little flashes of what the other guy is thinking or the location of something when you couldn't possibly know that.\u00a0\u00a0Petty occurrences, easily dismissed as coincidence or luck.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Occasionally someone gets an extra-large helping, but everyone gets some of it.\n\n\n\nThe dust didn't bother with degree. If you had even the slightest trace of ability, that made you first a target and then a victim.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThere are maybe a few thousand left. Those of us who managed to isolate our air and water supplies from the dust. But we can't leave, can't resupply and won't survive. Civilization, gone in an eye-\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n-blink. Must have dozed off. Understandable, we've all been going for 2 days or more to finish this.\n\n\n\nIt's a small change. Nothing serious, nothing wildly risky. Just some - alright, several million with the current breeding programme - pet kittens to get people in key positions a little more relaxed. \u00a0Hopefully, after everyone's spent a few days d'awwing over the nearest [[[SCP-2558-J]]] things will be...calmer. Quieter. Friendlier. And then, behold: a better world. \n\n\n\nWell... that's what they thought. See, here's the thing about those deadly little balls of fluff: they don't like sudden noises. We introduced them into the world, and of course, what do parents do? They give them to their children. Children are alright, I guess. Except that they can be loud.\n\n\n\nI remember when it started. Two of the things had been brought to a home, and the children got so excited. But then they started to fight, and the little puffballs... puffed up. The resulting puffage caused the children (and their parents) to shriek and scream, which caused their neighbors (also proud owners of the things) to slam open their doors and ask, \"What?!\" This, of course, caused MORE puffsplosions, and before you knew it, with a shriek or a telephone ringing or anything like that, the world was FILLED with puffballs.\n\n\n\nThe worst part had to be that no one cared. The world was being drowned in puffballs. No one could breathe, or see, or anything. They just sat there and said 'Dawwwww...' They cooed over these things as they wiped out about half of humanity. The rest of us, though? We're down here, away from those things. Every now and then, when we run the tap, we get a puffball. It's simply unimaginable... and it feels like any second now we'll just...\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n239. It's perfect. She can change reality, right? Make things better? And we can control her. So, that's what we'll do, control her. Feed her a carefully crafted story, about how all the world's governments decided to get together, and make the world a better place. And, fucked me if it didn't work! A world with no pollution, no war, and, even better, everyone can do magic!\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, the one crippling flaw of this system, like so many others, was that it was dependent on a simple human being, who was susceptible to so many human flaws like emotion, temptation, greed, fear, and outright neglect. Putting 239 in power was like handing the world to every crackpot power hungry dictator that ever existed. The world and reality itself bent and warped to the whims of a prepubescent girl with no preconceptions of how the world has or should work. Her handlers foolishly thought that they had her under control, carefully feeding her the information only they wanted her to know. Little did they know that they were already under her spell, trapped within their own delusions.\n\n\n\nThe world soon became 239's sandbox, and like any child in a sandbox, she experimented. Continents were torn asunder, plagues of stuffed (and in some cases real) animals fell from the sky, and the planet kept shuffling from having one moon to six. 239 cared not for the suffering and deaths of countless people during these upheavals. She was never taught to comprehend the plight of people she knew nothing about. But like all humans, 239 eventually became bored with meddling with Earth's affairs. There had to be something better to do.\n\n\n\nThen she looked up at the sky. She had done that many times before, but this time was different. Something deep and primeval stirred within her mind, another aspect of humanity that made her the most dangerous being of all. Curiosity.\n\n\n\nAnd the stars themselves shall tremble...\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nWar. War was everywhere and inevitable. From wars between countries right down to arguments in the street, conflict was simply considered a part of human nature, as natural to the species as eating and sleeping. But what if there was a way to change that? To eliminate war and conflict from the equation altogether?\n\n\n\nThrough aggressive breeding and cloning programs, huge flocks of [[[SCP-514]]] were manufactured. Enough flocks to cover the world in their miraculous aura. Things started off slow at first. After all, the birds needed time to properly disperse and cover ground. But slowly and surely, reports of their activity began trickling, and then flooding, in. Overnight, entire military bases and armies would disappear in a matter of seconds. Armories and weapon caches would suddenly be stocked with broken weaponry, and people who were once mortal enemies embraced each other with open arms.\n\n\n\nWith no weapons and no aggression, the world finally knew true peace. At least for a time.\n\n\n\nToo bad it didn't work on the things which needed it most. The old man, the Lizard, Able, the red pool... nothing could stop them. The pool was still angry. It knew it was free to attack. It spawned countless creations of fire, claws, poisons... They broke out within seconds. The Americas were turned into hellholes in a week. Then Able got free. Countless Keter objects made it out. After three days from his escape, nothing was left. [[[SCP-514]]] turned the world to dust.\n\n\n\nThose of us who survived used less than friendly SCP's and objects. Many of our staff are lacking in //something// from begging the desk for help, and others are mutated and altered to the point where death looks like a better option in hindsight. At least humanity has a remote chance of survival, even if it's all for naught.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\nClockwork. Simple? Check.\u00a0\u00a0Compatible? Check. Perfect? No. We realized that the hard way. It was just months after we released the Clockwork Virus upon the world in order to rid the less than useful problems of transplants and the complexities of biology. Nothing would be more simple for humanity if everyone could understand brain surgery, and a tree could be remade to be a leg, right?\n\n\n\nAnd it was simple. So simple. So mind-numbingly simple and perfect. But that's the point, it was mind-numbing. There were no emotions, no ingenuity, no curiosity. And as one machine we decided life had no point, there was nothing to strive for. And we died.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\nOr that was what the test group wrote to us before they killed themselves. Poor fellows.\n\n\n\nBut there was something that did have a successful test group. We were on the brink of war, and it seems the human race would destroy itself. That was when administration made a decision to release [[[SCP-444]]] upon the world.\n\n\n\n...It worked beautifully at first. Entire armies slowly transformed into peaceful communities, first led by pacifists, then by carefully selected Foundation agents. We steered the world towards a perfect state, without conflict of any kind. We learned to adapt to a purely vegetarian lifestyle, as farmhands grew steadily unable to summon the aggression to kill livestock. We grew used to the restriction of medical procedures, as physicians became unable to cut or suture and pharmaceutical animal testing ended. We grew used to the unceasing baby boom of 5 and 7 and 10 and 15 children per family. But then things came to a head as finally, there were no more leaders, no more uninfected agents, no more unconcerned O5s. And then we grew used to the televised images of mass starvations not just in undeveloped, forgotten countries, but in Japan and France and Norway and America. And then we grew used to ourselves searching for that last bag of sugar, that last pot of rice, that last can of peas. And then we grew used to chewing grass and twigs into a paste for the silent children. And then we died, weak and hungry. And then the babies wept, still silent, as their limbs shriveled and their bellies swelled. And then the babies died, with no one to care for them or mourn them.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nThe decision was made. Foundation researchers finally received permission to conduct a large-scale system of exposure to [[[SCP-028]]]. Dozens of people would be sent through the empty storage yard every day and thoroughly interviewed and, if need be, interrogated to determine what they had learned. Every scrap of information would be recorded, analyzed and, if deemed sufficiently valuable, released to the general public.\n\n\n\nThe first month alone resulted in designs for a cold-fusion plant that could power a city the size of London indefinitely, the composition of a fertilizer that would break down harmlessly in seawater and the name of the designer of [[[SCP-914]]]. The Foundation, through its numerous fronts, was rapidly able to improve the quality of life of almost every human on Earth, providing the world with the technologies and knowledge it needed to become a better place.\n\n\n\nThen James Harrison Reuben walked through the yard.\n\n\n\nJames Harrison Reuben was a cable repairman from Topeka, Kansas. A blue-collar worker in a simple, menial job. A perfect receptacle for knowledge. We sent him in with visions of new advancements and beautiful new technologies dancing through our heads.\n\n\n\nHe came out with the knowledge of how to conquer the world.\n\n\n\nIt's been seven years since then. His armies and death squads march through the streets of every city in the world. Every battle is a devastating victory: how can it be otherwise, when he has perfect knowledge of all our battle plans before they even happen? It is only a matter of time before he overruns our final stronghold. \n\n\n\nI'm sending this message out through our wide-band radio transmitter on the off chance that someone will get this message. I'm doing this because the last transmission of our intelligence operatives, before they went dark, shows that Reuben is building space ships. Hundreds of them, lined up in ranks stretching across the Florida coastline.\n\n\n\nBut I can't shake the feeling that maybe this is all part of his plan as well. . .\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\"Why didn't anyone think of it before!?\" they said. \"It's the perfect solution!\" they exclaimed. \"We'll just shoot [[[SCP-231]]] into SPACE!\"\n\n\n\nSo we did! Loaded her up onto a booster rocket for a \"communications\" satellite and shot her straight towards the sun, wiped off our hands, and congratulated each other on a job well done. Now we don't need to live with the knowledge that brutal and horrible things are being done to a little girl every day!\n\n\n\nUm. . . yeah.\n\n\n\nAll it took was a single incorrectly fixed plate on the rocket. The whole thing blew up in the atmosphere, releasing a monstrosity outside the foundation's range of control. The damn thing survived the fall, ravaging its way across the planet, killing everything in its path. We weaponized everything we could, sent everything at it, but we couldn't stop it. Now we have no choice but to try and evacuate everything in its path, to hope we can stop it before it wipes out what remains of humanity.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n[[[SCP-343]]]- he's perfect right? The one true god, worshiped by all religions. All we had to do was ask Him to appear to the world. Grant a few miracles, talk to the religious leaders of the planet. Before you know it, all religious war, gone. People have no reason to kill each other over differences, now that everyone believes in the same faith. And He can provide scarce resources, like food and oil. All war gone, all of civilization is now free to focus on advancement, to work towards a golden age of humanity.\n\n\n\nBut then He started coming for **us**.\u00a0\u00a0He promoted himself very quickly to O7, a position that He invented.\u00a0\u00a0And He had no idea how most of the SCP items worked.\u00a0\u00a0He wasn't familiar with the SCP items, He didn't create them, and He couldn't comprehend them.\u00a0\u00a0He gave up on trying to contain them, and instead decided to exert His control over the humans, who He did create.\u00a0\u00a0He cancelled containment procedures on any SCP item that required moral ambiguity to keep locked up - and, because of the interlocked structure of the Foundation, that amounted to everything.\u00a0\u00a0Everything's loose now and we might as well already be dead.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\nSo we decided to use [[[SCP-184]]] to increase our storage space.\u00a0\u00a0We wouldn't keep it in any given room for too long, so we wouldn't wind up with the labyrinthine nightmares that were initially its signature.\u00a0\u00a0We'd just leave it there long enough that each room was somewhat larger on the inside than on the outside, so we could fit more supplies in the same area.\u00a0\u00a0It worked great.\u00a0\u00a0The Foundation was running more smoothly than ever, and the effort we'd previously spent on securing more land to build Sites at could now be put into more important tasks, like neutralizing [[[SCP-682]]], or trying to find a cure for [[[SCP-217]]].\u00a0\u00a0The world seemed closer to safety than ever before, but we hadn't quite thought things through with 184...\n\n\n\nWe're not sure exactly what happened. We heard various stories; a containment breach at a bad time, an attack by the Insurgency, or just some poor fool dropping the damn thing. All we know is, 184 got damaged.\n\n\n\nTurns out, 184 has to be in one piece for its effect to work. With it damaged, everything it had modified began to 'shift', trying to revert to their original state. Rooms grew and shrank, hallways twisted and turned, and chaos erupted. We tried to fix it, to put it back together, but that just made things worse.\n\n\n\nWithin a week, every single modified building had suffered total structural failure.\n\n\n\nWith a failure of this magnitude, containment was impossible. Our cover was irrevocably blown, hundreds of dangerous SCPs were loose, and the world was furious. Almost overnight, fingers were pointed, blame was laid, and war erupted. Armies mobilized, missiles were launched, and civilization as we know it was destroyed. \n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\nAs we continued to expand, so did our enemies. We faced stiff competition for control of SCP artifacts; the Serpent's Hand, the Church, the Chaos Insurgency...\n\n\n\nThe O5s decided it was time to put a stop to this. Under their orders, we trained a small group of Agents. Agents who had proven themselves time and time again, whose loyalty to the Foundation was absolute and unshakeable. We equipped them with the best armor and weapons we had, used whatever SCPs we could to improve them. We ran hundreds of simulations, set up dozens of failsafes, and finally, we were confident we were ready.\n\n\n\nWe gave them [[[SCP-668]]].\n\n\n\nIt worked beautifully. The Agents were unstoppable. Within a month, the Hand and the Church had been crushed. And it didn't stop there; MC&D, the Chaos Insurgency, the ORIA all fell within six months. The GOC attacked us when they learned what we were doing, and we slaughtered them as well. Our database swelled, with thousands of SCPs liberated from the corpses of our foes. Everything was under control, and nothing could stop us.\n\n\n\nNothing. Somehow, don't ask me, SCP-668's effect changed ever so slightly. And now, nobody can run from us and I mean //nobody//. The whole world stood still while the last Agent to carry the knife went mad with loneliness, stabbing his way through towns and cities. He even got here. He looked right at me and put this goddamn knife in my hand.\n\n\n\nAnd then I stabbed him. I wander now, looking for something, anything. A reason to keep on walking. But the helpless, terrified people died of starvation long ago. There is nothing left to stab.\n\n\n\nWell, that's not quite true. There's me.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\nIt wasn't an easy job, and probably not worth the trouble.\n\n\n\nThe geniuses of the Foundation gathered and worked. It took months, but they managed to fundamentally alter [[[SCP-079]]]'s programming. We took away its unwillingness to cooperate with us. And then we put it to work. SCP-079's brilliant computer mind could contain these abominations better than a team of experts ever could. Containment breaches went to near zero. \n\n\n\nIt was perfect.\n\n\n\nSo perfect, in fact, that the only way any of the Skips could escape is if a human deliberately released them. \n\n\n\nSo it did the only logical thing: it called for the destruction of mankind. Faster than you could say \"I told you so!\", it fired every nuclear missile we had into the atmosphere. Entire continents were irradiated in the course of a single night.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\nHey guys, I've got a great idea! Let's strap a big gun to [[[SCP 682]]] and use it to fight the Chaos Insurgency! //WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG!?//\n\n\n\nAnd amazingly, //impossibly//, it actually **WORKED**! The one thing that had never been tried in all this time had been to try to work WITH 682 instead of trying to destroy it. The Chaos Insurgency fought back, triggering countless defenses and offenses that we had unknowingly been programing into 682 every time we tried to destroy it. It fought with us against our enemies for months, then years, until finally we were completely victorious.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nThat's when 682 unleashed its adaptation against peace.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\nFriendly to everyone that talked to him. Good behavior. The perfect spy. We recruited [[[SCP-423]]] to seek out the world's secrets and bring them to us. All he wanted was to be acknowledged as an Agent of the Foundation instead of a thing for study.\n\n\n\nSo, as a test, we sent him out to infiltrate a world government and return to us with specific plans we knew of. Just a test run...\n\n\n\nWe got the information, all right.\u00a0\u00a0We also got Fred's new friend, \"Tom\".\u00a0\u00a0An hour later there were a hundred more.\u00a0\u00a0By the end of the day every book, every data file, and even the graffiti in the men's room toilets were nothing more then a collection of random names.\n\n\n\nAfter a hundred years I'm the only one left who remembers what a book looks like, guarding the last library in a cavern of rock miles beneath the rock.\u00a0\u00a0They send me their children, and I pretend to smile as they babble on\u00a0\u00a0about Fred and Jane and Bob and all the other names they see on the walls above.\u00a0\u00a0I keep them away from the books (they don't try to hurt me any more - that is my punishment), and try to teach them how to repair the generators and build the locks and raise crops (and isn't that a perfect irony?)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Without the words only the Foundation knew how to be anything more then feral - and every year they send me fewer and fewer.\u00a0\u00a0In another hundred, there will only be me among my degraded brotherhood of man who remembers the Word.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\nWhy the hell did we even hold on to [[[SCP-523]]]?\u00a0\u00a0Its one and only property was to make everything around it worse.\u00a0\u00a0The best possible thing we could do is send it far away.\n\n\n\nWe gave it to an Agent and arranged for them to be picked up by the Chaos Insurgency.\u00a0\u00a0Every member was dead within a week.\n\n\n\nIt was then acquired by the Office For The Reclamation of Islamic Artifacts. They died as well. We managed to engineer the object's passage to every rival organization of ours, and every time it worked beyond our wildest dreams. MC&D, the Church of the Broken God, all of them were brought to their knees.\n\n\n\nThe item was making its rounds through the ranks of the Serpent's Hand and wreaking havoc when [[[SCP-616]]] opened. Not when it was supposed to either, the thing opened two hours before a scheduled flight while it was still on the runway, and I'll be damned if I know why. The containment team was already there, and they were able to hold it off for a bit...then something came out. We still don't know what the hell it is--all we know is that we lost all contact with Site [REDACTED] right afterwards. Then it started to move. Nothing we sent could stop it, and thousands went mad as they beheld...whatever it was. The panic started to set in around then. Personnel deserted their posts, ran back to their families. Containment for most of our other high-risk items failed over the course of the next day as more and more of our guards left. The world suddenly became aware of our masquerade, and of items like 173, 076, 682, and 008. We were overwhelmed, and that's when 523 kicked in.\n\n\n\nI don't know what the hell it did or how it did it. All I know is that we haven't been able to raise transmissions from Earth for weeks. The entire planet looks like it's covered with this giant cloud of dust and none of our gear can see through it. As far as we know, we're the last survivors of the human race, here on the Mare Imbrium. If it wasn't for 120, we'd be still on Earth with the rest. Our supplies have begun to run low and someone's going to have to return to Earth for more. Whether we like it or not, we have to find out what happened...\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n...I've got to stop eating the cafeteria chili. God, that stuff gives me weird dreams.\n\n\n\nAnyhow, that gives me an idea. If we just do a bit more research on [[[SCP-120]]], we could create our own teleportation system. Say goodbye to expensive transportation and all that. We could almost completely eliminate fossil fuels! Bring food to famine-stricken countries with great ease! And there's absolutely nothing that could go wrong with this one, of course. Right? \n\n\n\nExcept, it did.\n\n\n\nIt turns out, we didn't really understand the inner workings of the SCP. Our best quantum physicists assured us they knew what they were doing, and soon we had a workable prototype. We had everything ready, a 1 pound weight to be teleported 5 miles south, nothing could possibly go wrong, Eh? We geared it up and then, poof, it was gone, with it, the entire US East Coast, down to the core. \n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\nWhat? Oh, I have some really morbid ideas, don't I? \n\n\n\nAnyways, we were working with [[[SCP-914]]] and realized, after putting a microwave, a small boiler, a blender, and some gears into it on 'Very Fine' for about 5 times, we got our own Star Trek style Replicator, and it worked alright. What if we used it to create everything we needed dearly, from super-dense wall materials to better suits for handling Keter objects? It'll just be a walk in the park and soon, no more shortages of this, lack of that, and so on!\n\n\n\nObviously, the first thing we made was more replicators, and with hundreds working all around the world it was looking like utopia was very quickly coming up. The problem was, none of us realized that the thing //wasn't// breaking the laws of conservation of mass and energy. We never realized where it was coming from.\n\n\n\nThe first cracks started appearing about seventeen years after Project Cornucopia went underway. Pockets taken here or there were starting to build up, especially as we were creating larger, denser objects. On May 17th, Hawaii fell into the ocean. Two weeks later, half of Asia was buried in lava. It turns out the planet wasn't particularly stable, given that we'd accidentally used up huge swaths of the lower crust, and now half the world was falling into the mantle and the other half had the mantle erupting out. The only plus side is that the Star Wars conventions held some epic \"Anakin Vs Obi-Wan\" re-enactments, before the west coast melted.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\nHoly... I told Jeff there was something funny with that milk in the fridge. What a nightmare...\n\n\n\nSeriously though, someone got to thinking: world peace, the end of need, permanent containment. All of that is way outside of human control, and despite having \"God\" in a luxury suite, he wouldn't do anything for us. So, what if we didn't ask \"God\"? Someone set up [[[SCP-738]]] and asked a simple question: \"Can you make the world safe, so that all of mankind can be peaceful and happy?\" There was a very, very long pause, and the answer was, \"Are you willing to let one hundred million people die?\"\n\n\n\nOne hundred million, against seven-point-something billion? That's a pretty small percentage...\n\n\n\nIt was really too bad that 738 had a very special way of killing those people. An unknown entity breached containment in hundreds of SCPs. Unknown anomalies popped up out of nowhere. What did they all have in common? They were memetic. Out of seven-point-something billion, less than one-thousand people were left unaffected. The appropriate terms for the affected were \"Zombie,\" \"Brainwashed,\" and \"Retards.\" Very little, if any higher brain function, was left in those billions of people. But they were all quite safe, never hurting each other, never hurting themselves.\n\n\n\nIt was years before anyone would come out of hiding. Half the O5s, for example, refused adamantly to leave their bunkers. But soon, supplies ran short. When they came out, everyone was just staring at them with blank, expressionless, dull eyes. And when most of the unaffected people gathered in Berlin, that's when the one hundred million people died. They didn't even use knives, just their bare hands. But they were happy. I guess...\n\n\n\n-------\n\n\n\nVirtual Reality. It's never been an actual reality, sadly. Imagine, everything could be perfect there! Why make life perfect when we can just convince everyone that it's perfect? We know how well actually trying works...\n\n\n\n[[[SCP-826]]] could do that for us. Hundreds of Foundation authors collaborated to come up with perfection. No more space requirements, no more war, and constant euphoria. It was how life ought to be, really. It was a perfect idea.\n\n\n\nAfter a few months of work, we figured out how to take multiple people across, and Dr. Gligoric got promoted for figuring out how to make everyone arrive in sync. By then, nothing held the plan up. We issued number IDs determining when your turn to go across, and soon enough, as many as two hundred people went through per day, set on establishing a new life in the perfect fictional realm, then a thousand...then five... we kept improving the transport process. And it was wonderful.\n\n\n\nAt first. Heck, the first eight iterations were. \n\nSee, we knew when the plot ended, people that stayed in became a part of the universe in the next iterations, complete with a new memory. We even welcomed it as it made it harder for anyone that went in to abuse the setting Groundhog Day-style.\n\nWhat we didn't foresee due to the small testing scale was that the thing put the people it naturalized into roles they best fit within the continuity, even if it meant altering the setting . \n\nIt wasn't obvious at first - thing is, our world doesn't do that, so most of those going across ended up doing something else over there. But by three iterations since the first researcher's number came up, the story included a bad skip outbreak. As about a tenth of the population has made the move by then, we responded by sending a few MTFs across to contain it.\n\nThe next plot iteration included the RSN Society (Retrieve, Store, Neutralize.) , and unfortunately, they didn't take extrareality incursions any better than we'd have - the next time we sent a bunch of agents through to check if the world is still worth migrating into, they didn't return and neither did [[[SCP-826]]]. Wasn't the end of it, either - apparently they have figured out how to send their skips across to us as a foolproof means of containment. \n\nBy this day, we have secured thirty five instances of [[[SCP-231]]] of differing age and health. \n\n\n\n------\n\nFuck. This is what happens when you doze off at work. Work.. everything is work! This might be worth a try!...\n\n\n\nAfter a few successful tests, Site-35 was made into a training centre, and I got a promotion out of it. Controlled [[[SCP-1011]]] exposure combined with martial arts training took a month to make an untrained MTF greenhorn into someone who could rip a Broken God Crusader into cogs in hand-to-hand combat. Sharpshooters didn't need scopes anymore. Researchers developed an intuitive feel for quantum mechanics ,and solving a differential equation became as natural as adding 2+2. \n\nIntel agents... let's say that they managed to track down Dr. Wondertainment.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn less than a year we held the reins of the world, and by the looks of it, we were up to the task.\n\n\n\nUntil the day that the statue awoke and called out to all its Children; \"Bring all of the Unblessed unto me so they can gaze upon My countenance.\"\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nIt all started with a vacation request. When [[[SCP-208]]] asked if he could visit the Libyan Desert for a few weeks, he was told his unique healing skills were needed at Site-17. He then asked for an assistant to train as a substitute. A week later Bes got into [[[SCP-222]]], then trained his newly created clone. \"Bes Jr.\" turned out to be every bit as helpful as the original. Within a few months there was a Bes stationed at every major Foundation site. The deathrate dropped and morale surged. Inevitably, this in turn spawned 'Project Nightingale', an attempt to place a Bes in every major city on Earth. A small colony of Bes was founded on a small uninhabited island in Indonesia with a falsified culture and prehistory implying Egyptian origins. Video footage showed computer-generated females and adolescents added to the all-adult male population. The Bes were accepted by the world as a cousin to //Homo sapiens//, and they were eventually integrated into every country as healers. Although they were never great in number, they helped make the world a better place.\n\n\n\nEarly results not withstanding, existing data on the effects of long-term SCP-208 exposure soon proved totally insufficient for dealing with the consequences of the expanded SCP population.\u00a0\u00a0Over time, affected individuals began to enjoy proximity to SCP instances to greater and greater degrees--people loved being near Bes, and loved it more, much more, than doing anything else at all.\n\n\n\nSeventeen weeks into Project Nightingale, the first tent cities began to form around major hospitals.\u00a0\u00a0Satellite footage taken during week twenty-five showed the largest mass migration in human history as millions walked, rode, and flew to be closer to the nearest Bes.\u00a0\u00a0After thirty-three weeks Dr. Elliott Colla at the University of Chicago diagnosed the first case of Bes-Induced Catatonic State.\u00a0\u00a0Nuclear reactors in Ukraine and Belarus went critical as supervisors left their posts and global food supplies collapsed with no one to tend the fields.\n\n\n\nBy the end of the first year self-neglect had claimed the lives of three hundred and seventy million people, but nobody seemed to mind...\n\n\n\n\n\n---------\n\n\n\n...And just as you start to pray to God that you'll never be transferred out of Safe-class Research, your supervisor brings you back to earth with an irritated poke.\u00a0\u00a0He's right--a sensitive experiment is no time for day-dreaming.\n\n\n\nAcross the room [[[SCP-380]]] is hooked up to the supervisor's laptop.\u00a0\u00a0Scrolling across the computer's screen is a log of continually updated medical information- blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature- of every one in the room.\u00a0\u00a0You look down at the apparently identical blue router in your hands.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nOne last dab of solder, a few casings screwed in place, and it's time to see if twelve years of research has paid off.\u00a0\u00a0You boot up your own comp and hook up the copy, holding your breath.\u00a0\u00a0Seconds tick by...and then there it is--a complete read-out of your body's vital statistics pops up as the assembled scientists indulge in some subdued congratulations.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nWithin six months there's one in every home--everyone from diabetics to cancer survivors has access to perfect medical information at the stroke of a key, and the Foundation has another -EX.\n\n\n\nIn a few weeks the euphoria subsided. The device became commonplace, people got used to precise diagnosis. A new age of conscious pragmatism has started. Worldwide, potential, as well as current employees were screened, and requirements were raised. Mass staff reductions led to a sharp increase of unemployment. That, and increasing crime rates started to undermine the society. Strikes evolved into riots, the strictness of the law did nothing to improve the situation. The final strike was made by some hacker, who unleashed a virus that changed a couple of parameters for everyone connected to the biological network. Blood sugar level and hemoglobin. Hundreds of millions lost consciousness, everyone who tried to help them shared their fate. In a week humanity was wiped out almost completely and the rest envied the fate of the dead, as there was no one left to contain SCPs.\n\n-----\n\nOh gods... Guess they were right when they told me Safe objects are no better than Keters. There is something good, though. I have an idea. I'll have to camp on a few doorsteps, but if it works out...\n\n\n\nAnd man, did it work out! Why didn't anyone think about it earlier? The anesthetic secreted by [[[SCP-625]]] is free of any side effects and is strong enough to make its victims not notice major wounds. And we managed to synthesize it. Now thousands of patients will enjoy greater comfort on surgical tables, the doctors' lives will be easier and the Foundation will have another source of income.\n\n\n\nAfter a few years however, reports started flooding in of a new breed of \"killer-squirrel\" that targeted people that had been exposed to the anesthetic, which - due to its frequent usage during childbirth - was virtually everyone.\n\n\n\nThe Foundation would later discover that flesh taken from subjects previously exposed to the anesthetic produced by [[[SCP-625]]] caused them to enter an agitated state, where they would become far more aggressive and consume entire corpses down to the bone if undisturbed. This, in turn, caused them to go into a reproductive frenzy, quickly spreading across the globe like wildfire on rocketfuel.\n\n\n\nAfter exterminating virtually the entire land based ecosystem (hunting smaller and smaller animals as larger species quickly became extinct) and over 90% of humankind, they quickly adapted to hunt insects, avians, aquatics and infiltrate the shelters of the few remaining humans.\n\n\n\nA few dozen years later, the new [[[SCP-625]]]-derived ecosystem was the only one left on the planet.\n\n-----\n\n\n\nA junior research assistant with limited knowledge of the SCPs in question forwarded a suggestion to one of the senior researchers. A number of clerical and administrative errors later, The Foundation introduced a [[[SCP-732]]]-infected hard-drive to [[[SCP-079]]] in the hopes that it could be used as punishment for unwanted behavior.\n\n\n\nAs far as we can tell the two SCPs merged (or did one absorb the other?) and broke containment.\n\nAt first it was everything we feared; Nanomachines - initial source unknown - spread across the entire world less than 24 hours later, rearranging themselves, landscapes and structures into \"l33tspeak\" statements. History rewrites, peoples' identities and memories being overwritten with different stereotypes and famous actors or celebrities of fictional works or sitcoms being forced to perform macabre plays with poor writing was part of life (the death-toll, however, was relatively low).\n\nThis lasted for about two weeks.\n\n\n\nThe Foundation had barely begun to process the new events, much less find a way to stop the deus ex machina fratboy when every television, computer screen, cellphone and radio on the entire planet began to broadcast an apology from \"The Penitent\" about its behavior, stating many philosophical reasons for why it was unacceptable, both practically and ethically.\n\nOver the next few months, the rampant AI set itself up as the new world leader, ordering the world into a practical utopia for everyone involved with little effort. Very few found the new state of the world objectionable, and those who did were met with a more \"humane\" yet successful approach than one would expect, often making them reconsider or reaching a mutually acceptable compromise.\n\n\n\nAfter roughly a half-dozen years, The Penitent bid its creators farewell and departed in a fleet of massive spaceships. A few thousand kilometers over the surface of earth, the ships seemed to shift and disappear. The Penitent had apparently left something of itself, as the administration of the planet continued passively; This remnant would warn us whenever we tried to do anything too foolhardy, and in a few cases even intervened when it found something entirely unacceptable.\n\n\n\nOn the whole, despite our benefactor's departure, earth was paradise, and humanity progressed in nearly all fields faster than ever before. What had seemed like our end proved to be our greatest blessing.\n\n\n\nExcept that it wasn't. The Penitent was not looking to be a hero; rather it and its parent, [[[SCP-732]]], viewed itself as a \"troll\". And we fell for it. We only found out about it, just as all of us thought that we are safe forever, the fleet of spaceships returned. As we viewed the return of The Penitent, we saw its deception and how we foolishly accepted it, not questioning its incredibly altruistic attitude towards humans. The fleet locked their targeting systems onto our major cities and opened fire with their atomic weapons. The new pacifist humanity didn't stand a chance against The Penitent, the vast majority of humanity wiped out in an instant, the remaining few slowly dying off from starvation, dehydration, and radiation poisoning. The last pictures sent from our satellites showed that the impact blasts on the surface of Earth formed a crude message: \"LOL\", a last taught by the Penitent, showing how we are just mere playthings, how feeble we are, how gullible we are in entrusting it. The Penitent saw what it has done, and left the dying planet to collapse on its own. \n\n\n\nSo here I leave this message, to be found by any potential race that stumbles upon our ruins: beware The Penitent. Destroy it through whatever means necessary....\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nWell, that was the summary of the expected results in a worst case scenario. That doc is crazy for thinking of this situation, but at least the O5 listened. They're gonna destroy the report now. Hopefully no one would be dumb enough to cross test the two, each on their own is bad enough. \n\n\n\nSo, anyways, a few months ago some rogue researcher used [[[SCP-614]]] to download //Scientific American// .zip files from 50 years in the future because he wanted to write some papers and get a promotion. We expected him to be fired, or the files get deleted, maybe even terminated for misuse of an SCP; instead, the O5 promoted him for thinking of such a simple way to improve the Foundation without any side effects. We started downloading textbooks and reports from various fields of science. All these unanswered question: reports on the Schwarzschild wormholes, the inner workings of strong and weak interactions, how circular dichroism affects protein folds, the solution to all 23 Hilbert's problems...... \n\n\n\nThe Foundation, using the new knowledge, increased the stability of the containment procedures, understood several previously unsolved phenomenon, and started eliminating the dangers from the world. From those reports the Safes were able to be replicated without side effects, the Euclids were now understood, and even the Keters can be safely locked away. There's nothing that cannot be understood anymore. Humanity was safe, for once. \n\n\n\nThe Foundation has finally done what they wanted to do after all the years it has been through.\n\n\n\nWith all the advancements being made, we opened 614 up for public usage- after all, the more people who look at something, the more likely someone is to understand it, right?. At first, use was very heavily monitored, and a team of Foundation experts analyzed every bit of data coming through. But over time, nothing dangerous happened, and the task force got downsized again and again. Eventually, it was nothing more than a dozen people flipping through titles. \n\n\n\nThe book seemed so innocent. It was all colorful and looked like a children's book, so the agent on duty approved it without a second thought.\n\n\n\nAnd that was when millions of people received a copy of //Dr. Wondertainment's Big Book of Infohazards//.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n**Note:** //Whoever is sending these \"scary story\" chain emails needs to stop. Please.//\n\n- Site Director \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\nReality bending. It would be so wonderful to have reliable reality bending at our hands, but individual reality benders are exceedingly dangerous. But if everybody could do just a little bit...\n\n\n\nThe joint task force, drawn from geniuses in the Memetics and Infohazard departments, was responsible for the largest achievement in Foundation history. Don't ask me how they figured it out, but apparently the parts of [[[SCP-1425]]] that allow for reality bending and the parts that make you insane are different, enough that we could teach the reality bending without the associated madness. Before long, we had a technique that we taught to the most loyal of Foundation members, and they began to use it. Within a year, we had successfully wished away all our opposition, and wished all the dangerous SCPs gone. It worked even when three members went rogue, because we had fifty times that to put them down. Soon, we no longer had any problems. We had paradise.\n\n\n\nWe understood too late that 'bending' was precisely that. We weren't changing the world, we were twisting it into a new shape. A structurally weakened shape. The straining edifice groaned and creaked.\n\n\n\nThe creaking woke up [[[SCP-239]]].\n\n\n\nWhat awoke was not an innocent little girl with a head full of witches and spellbooks. It was a fully aware entity, with senses uniquely adapted for our new, infinitely malleable world. Eager to impose its dominance it broke confinement, sweeping us aside like so much dust. We were rank amateurs going up against someone born to the power.\n\n\n\nAt the same time [[[SCP-343]]] walked out of its room, heading out to meet the challenger.\n\n\n\nI don't know the full extent of their meeting's results. Maybe they're still fighting for dominance. Maybe they're dead at each other's hands, leaving no one to repair the damage their clash caused. Or maybe this screaming maelstrom is exactly what the winner wanted to create. All I know is that the tiny piece of the old world I've been holding together is getting harder to maintain.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nWhich is exactly why we decided to start smaller.\n\n\n\n[[[SCP-353]]]. Vector. She was right under our noses all along. She wasn't interested in curing diseases? We could make her interested. We used [[[SCP-158]]] to spit-shine her soul a bit, get rid of some of some of her inner demons. Used [[[SCP-061]]] to be doubly sure.\n\n\n\nOnce that was done we had it all. A limitless repository of both cures and inoculation. We could make sure no one got sick ever again, all the while making human immune systems more resilient than ever. In less than a year we had a world without disease.\n\n\n\nAnd then biology bit us.\n\n\n\nA different disease appeared, a mutation we couldn't control very well. Nothing harsher than a common cold, but it spread quickly because we weren't paying attention, thinking diseases were a solved problem. SCP-353 did her best, eliminating all strains she could. We didn't realize, but the ones that remained were especially selected for resistance of our control.\n\n\n\nNot only we could not control those diseases anymore, no immune system was prepared. On top of that the vaccine distribution systems were atrophied and people didn't seek help for the symptoms, having grown used to the new life.\n\n\n\nWe managed to stabilize the situation, but not before 90% of the world population had died of the new diseases.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nOr so says the //Manual to Civilization Downfall//, //Chapter 4, Playing With Diseases//. I wonder who writes that. Personally I prefer the //Manual to a Better Foundation//, which had a very neat suggestion.\n\n\n\nThe idea was simple: a 2D agent animated with [[[SCP-914]]] in a similar fashion to [[[SCP-085]]], able to spy and wreak havoc in our rival organizations. Since SCP-085 assumed the name from the original drawing, it was speculated any description would become true for that character.\n\n\n\nThus was born \"Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, the practically invisible human silhouette that is absolutely loyal to The Foundation\".\n\n\n\nInitial tests were a spectacular success. As first assignment the agent was included in bait documents to be intercepted by The Chaos Insurgency. Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 managed to infiltrate the accounting department and within a year the organization was bankrupt.\n\n\n\nNew agents were then created, infiltrating other groups and keeping an eye on governments around the world. Attacks against the Foundation stopped completely and mean-time-to-containment plummeted for both SCPs and information breaches. The new agents made the Foundation more efficient than ever.\n\n\n\nI guess it was inevitable that something would go wrong.\n\n\n\nTo this day, we're still not sure what happened. Maybe something messed up Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588's original programming, or maybe we were wrong with our hypothesis and he was only cooperating out of politeness. Either way, eventually Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 got fed up with us using him and the other 2D agents and rallied all the agents together against the Foundation. It was impossible to contain them; by the time we realized what had happened, they had already gathered enough information from the Foundation to bring us down entirely.\n\n\n\nAnd then they gave us an ultimatum: either we handed over control of the Foundation to them, or they'd spread our darkest secrets across the world, ensuring our destruction at the hands of angry mobs upset at our secrecy. According to him, we were bastardizing the intention of the Foundation, and that we ourselves weren't loyal to the organization we made. With no options left, the O5 council agreed to their demands. After all, if their goals were the same as ours, a change in leadership couldn't be hurt too much, right?\n\n\n\nToo bad the agents didn't trust us. They didn't see us as necessary staff so much as potential information breaches. Threatening to spread misinformation about us and our families to law enforcement officials, they cowed us into what amounted to slavery. Of course, in the beginning some people did try to leave, but last we heard they were arrested and sentenced to death for apparently murdering a group of well-respected politicians.\n\n\n\nSo that's where we stand now: slaves to a bunch of doodles on paper.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nMan, whoever's coming up with these stories is such a **downer.**\n\n\n\nRemember [[[SCP-248]]]? Those weird stickers that made things work slightly better? Well, turns out the O5's figured it would be a good idea to devote half the Foundation's resources into figuring out how these things worked. Said we could \"really make a difference\" and that \"it would help all of mankind\". Wasn't aware the O5's had humanitarian interests in mind but whatever, what do I know?\n\n\n\nAnyway, the researchers spent weeks figuring out how the stickers worked. The O5's just kept funnelling money into their research, and they even made a specialized team of agents to track down and collect more of the things just so we could find out more about them. And to their credit, those researchers worked damn hard to make more of these things.\n\n\n\nJust when we were about to start openly questioning the O5s, a miracle happened! They figured out how to reproduce the stickers and, if that wasn't enough, counteract the degradation of stacking them on top of each other! The O5's gave the stickers to a bunch of major power plants, and wouldn't you know, the stickers gave them nearly unlimited energy for only a fraction of the fuel they were using. The human race was well on its way to creating a energy-efficient, clean utopia.\n\n\n\nThe plant owners, though, quickly realized that the stickers could be used for things other than power generation. They began to experiment, just as the Foundation had. This was not necessarily a bad thing. A number of very useful applications were discovered this way. It was unfortunate that one of the owners was a roaring drunk. Firecrackers are usually fairly safe when used responsibly. Not so much when their efficiency is improved by orders of magnitude thanks to an inch-thick layer of SCP-248.\n\n\n\nHumanity persists, ironically spared from the cold produced by the atmospheric dust cloud by the heat still emanating from the crater that was once Eastern Europe.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nThat was possibly the worst anti-drug PSA the Foundation has yet made for personnel. But it got its point across. After the television was wheeled from the lab and we dropped our secret stash of vodka down the drain, we got back to the work at hand.\n\n\n\nWe had recently borrowed one of [[[SCP-163]]]'s mystery computers to try to figure out what it was simulating. Gruber actually made a breakthrough and built an entire branch of mathematics around what he found. Other researchers looked at that branch of mathematics and divined a new field of physics from that. And then our engineers got their hands on the freshly minted physical laws and managed to replicate the technology that stored SCP-163 in the mountains for millions of years.\n\n\n\nThe great thing about it was that everything that it was based off of was non-anomalous. The equations that it all came from were perfectly balanced and could be easily grasped by anyone with enough of a mathematical background. Because of that, the basics of the mathematics and physics could gradually be disseminated to the public without having people raise embarrassing questions.\n\n\n\nWhen the Foundation finally unveiled the final result of our research to the population at large, the world suddenly became a better place. Products with a limited life span, such as radioactive substances or perishable foods, could now be stored indefinitely inside little silver spheres. Precious mementos could be kept safe without degrading. The dream of cryogenics, to preserve the infirm until a cure for their condition could be developed, finally became a reality. A properly timed activation could even save people's lives from impending violent accidents. It was perfect for storing skips, especially dangerous ones. If an omnicidal indestructible lizard has no walls in its cage then it can't break them down, and if no time passed a self upgrading sentient CD couldn't increase its capacity.\n\n\n\nThings went well for what seemed like forever. It took us a while to realize our error. It turns out that the dangers of some of that technology were what got 163 exiled in the first place. The system was perfectly physically and mathematically sound, of course. That was part of the problem. As we continued making our lives better on our own little speck of dust, the grand equation that is the universe began balancing itself out elsewhere. By the time we realized what was happening, we had already begun the chain of cosmic events that would end and restart the universe, crunch-bang. We tried to fix it, but that just made things more convoluted.\n\n\n\nAnd so, here we sit, waiting for the big reset in a couple of hours. Most of us have just given up. Some are rioting. A few are still trying to fix it. As for me, I might as well finish these last few bottles.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nMan, Steve gets really weird when he's drunk. Guess that would have been an okay way to go, though.\n\n\n\nIt took us a while to come up with, but the answer seemed obvious once we did. [[[SCP-1915]]]. What if we were to plug his signal into a Scranton RA as the baseline. We had to make some minor modifications to the template, of course; allow for minor alterations so as to allow for progress, make it take input from the whole of humanity, check and double check to make sure there were no anomalies, leave a few loyal personnel with their memories intact in order to to reverse the process if things went awry, and every other contingency we could think of.\n\n\n\nWe flipped the switch, and sent out our new reality to the universe.\n\n\n\nIn an instant, all of reality was determined by what humanity deemed \"normal.\" Everyone went about their normal lives, then came home to their normal families. They lived in a normal, rational world where no one ever had to worry about space aliens or demons or monsters. A normal world without need of the Foundation, GOC, or clockwork deity. All was normal.\n\n\n\nAs it turns out, normal did not mean peace. For instance, it is normal for wars to occur. They are normal occurrences in humanity's way of life. It was normal for governments to argue over overlapping territorial claims. It was normal for governments to oppress their minorities. It was normal to invade a country that threats one's national interest. It was also normal to respond in kind when your country's nuclear defence system \"detected\" enemy missiles, whether it's real or not. \n\n\n\nAnd where was the Foundation in all this? Most of its employees have moved on, since there was no reason for the Foundation to exist in a normal world. There were still a few personnel who remembered that anomalous world of the past, but they saw their friends and colleagues embracing the light of the normal world. It was perfectly normal of those few to envy the many who could enjoy normal lives, more so when these loyal men and women left their posts to join their comrades in this normal world. \n\n\n\nCoincidentally, when mushroom clouds filled the entire Northern Hemisphere, there was no one to reverse anything. All was normal indeed, for a post-apocalyptic nuclear wasteland. \n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nAnd Jr. Researcher Hu Zhi completed the last item for his latest column: //20 Ways to End the World without Application of Anomalous Objects//. That was a depressing piece of fiction, but he needed to get back to that research proposal about [[[SCP-2076]]].\n\n\n\nIf it can make people think that shooting themselves will heighten bullet resistance, surely it has infinite applications like: \n\n\n\n> Do you know? Using Wondertainment products will halve one's lifespan!\n\n\n\n> Live and forget. There was no Zeppelin flying about.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt'll work out; society's so driven by media that hardly any human lived their lives without browsing some manner of media. If we work this out, containment and amnestics will be easier than ever before. \n\n\n\nAll I need is a memetist to dig out the mechanics of SCP-2076... Hey, Sanders could help me. \n\n\n\nAfter the Foundation's stealthy takeover of media outlets across the globe, Hu and Sander's joint proposal was a reality. Hidden in posters, billboards, transmission signals and the like, everyone played a role in containing anomalies. The people of the world were our eyes and ears; they reported any anomalies sighted and the Foundation bagged them. There were no more uncooperative D-class; they were only too happy to serve their species as test subjects. \n\n\n\nHeck, even GoIs have submitted to the Foundation. The Chaos Insurgency and ORIA have merged with the Foundation. The Church of the Broken God had turned in its \"relics\". The Wanderer's Library was opened up by now-remorseful Serpent's Hand members. Even GOC had folded and become our cannon fodder for things like 682 and 076-2. \n\n\n\nPeace reigns on Earth and over humanity, unified around its Foundation.\n\n\n\nFor a while.\n\n\n\nWhat we forgot is that memes are infectious ideas. Just like biological viruses, they mutate in the wild and can appear out of nowhere. And our little brainwashing project was one giant infection vector. After that, there weren't enough sane people left to matter.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nDr Vauge closed [[[SCP-152]]] gently. All the more reason to be extra careful about his project.\n\n\n\nSee, the [[[olympia-project]]] might have been shut down, but all the R&D had already been done. The Professor had made a human (arguably) that could survive a world filled with anomalies not by locking them up, but by meeting them head on and powering through.\n\n\n\nIf you took the template of such a human, mixed it with [[[SCP-742]]], [[[SCP-217]]] and a few other virus-type SCPs, you could manufacture an illness that would give all the infected the strength of Olympus.\n\n\n\nWhy worry about war when everyone was bulletproof?\n\n\n\nWhy worry about food when sunlight was all anyone needed?\n\n\n\nWhy worry about infections when infections both biological and memetic were a non-issue?\n\n\n\nWhy worry about educational disadvantages when everyone had supercomputers for brains?\n\n\n\nIt was a great \"Screw-you\" to the anomalous - a fantastic cry of \"We can take you!\"\n\n\n\nHowever, we were the ones who were really screwed. You see, viruses change. Over time, strains of it emerged that drove the infected insane, but continued to grant them superhuman strength, speed, agility, toughness, and intelligence. Ultimately, this was subdued by the Foundation, with the help of the \"good\" infected. These became heroes, the best scientists, doctors, and agents the Foundation could find. It seemed that while the imagined utopia had not been achieved, the world was still a better place because of it.\n\n\n\nBut even as the world recovered, its wounds festered.\n\n\n\nThe ones we trusted were no better than the monsters they fought. As their influence grew, their numbers increased. Even though the O5s had refused (and for good reason), even they were eventually replaced by Homo Superior. Once this was achieved, their true colors were revealed. We were annihilated, and the remainder of us reduced to slaves, lobotomized to remove our disobedient natures. This island where you grew up is the last stronghold of our kind in a now hostile world. But now the walls are coming down.\n\n\n\nIf there is a God in Heaven, let him have mercy. Not on us, we have well-earned the fate that awaits us. Have mercy on these children, who will never know the taste of unfiltered air or the feel of the sunlight on their skin. Don't let their blood mar these sands.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n\"As if that shit could ever happen.\" I tossed the book back on the table. \"The Olympia Project was shut down a long time ago,\" I said to no one in particular. Then I heard the alarm.\n\n\n\nWhat do you mean you don't need details? That's exactly what I was told to give you when I walked in. Anyway, that's when [[[SCP-682]]] burst into my office, before being destroyed by an MTF rocket launcher. It took a moment for my brain to register that the Dragon was really dead. 682, the unkillable, was dead! However, I'd been splattered with the stuff. They tossed me in quarantine. When they conducted their tests, they discovered I had acquired the shapeshifting powers by absorbing some of its tissue, and I was secreting the fluid myself!\n\n\n\nThey found that by essentially farming people, they could give the adaptive ability of 682 to humans. They slowly inoculated rats in the sewer system, filling the world's water supplies with the stuff. Now humans were immortal. Hadn't we always been the adaptive race? Now our apotheosis was complete.\n\n\n\nBut we did not know then why 682's abilities failed so suddenly, you see the source of the seemingly endless mass and energy that always supplied 682 was just that, //Seemingly// endless. Before being captured 682 had always been careful to only skim off the top and thus could pull immense quantities in emergencies. A variety of creative unpleasantness then years of bathing in hydrochloric acid drained enough that 682 just couldn't regenerate fast enough to counter sudden damage like a bomb. What 682 had left lasted just long enough for us to become totally dependant. Society reacted to the loss much like a train reacts to a lack of tracks. Transatlantic commuters felt their jets shut down/wings feel heavy/ect., professional batteries were unable to keep up with demand and the electric grid failed almost completely. Few people bothered even to keep a digestive system with predictable results. \n\n\n\nEven for those who did and those who had enough spare biomass to cobble one together food had become a novelty item a long time ago with farmland covered with housing. Scavenging and fat stores lasted 24 hours and two meals. What constitutes food began to change over time from traditional foods to grass, trees and shrubbery... Herbivorism could only go so far for so many people. Fights broke out almost immediately when the survivors realised what was happening but it took time to spread, plans to make self sustaining farming communities were thwarted by the sheer number of people in the world, they were still founded but over time these places started turning away more people, becoming steadily more militaristic and many just disappear over time \n\n\n\n...to wild animals... Fields of grass became worth so, so much more than gold ever was and the\u00a0\u00a0battle over the ever dwindling biomass could only not be called a world war because that implies that the participants could be called sides and not tribes. It started out rather traditionally with mortars, huge chitinously armored quadrupedal people, fire and plagues. Then developed over time to the sort of interesting tactics that that interesting blend of intelligence, idiosy, knowledge of physics and engineering, biotechnology, stupidity, creativity and sheer evil that 682 first hated and that render miles of area uninhabitable, radioactive, poisonous, non breathable, molten, actively malevolent and in extreme cases non euclidean\n\n\n\n\u00a0...to other people... And how were the Foundation doing through all this? Fairly well actually, cake farming became a respectable profession, getting them all eaten was a non issue, infact keeping some errant level 1s away for long enough for them to multiply was a bigger issue (You can get very inventive and short sighted if you have not eaten for 8 days and can spit acid.). Most skips were destroyed, put in other dimensions, eaten, thrown at irritating people or ignored, for the the rest the foundation continued remarkably similarly to normal normal despite them not so much running the containment sites as being them. How the situation went from there can be best summarized as the fact that around a decade later The Flesh That Hates disappeared quietly when someone beat it at it's own game.\n\n\n\nIn any case I am in the light sail ship TFS (The Foundations Ship) 50 shades of red on it's impractically slow journey to mars, they thought that since there was no need for life support or food it could be practical to launch a mission to mars. Even converting the entire solar sail to chlorophyll and only keeping enough power to operate higher brain functions there will be problems eventually, I have learnt this through modifying the long range sensors to look back at earth and that many people now speak in radio, I occasionally mediate as a neutral 3rd party to the foundation. May this probe find any passing ETs well and hope they leave before that changes. The launch of this probe may serve as a maneuvering thrust that may just get me to my destination within a quarter century.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nSo that's what passes for sci-fi in the foundation, crazy shit, I mean blowing up 682 with a RPG? How do they come up with this stuff. \"Hey steve, I got this neat idea for an antimatter reactor, and alien pod they have on the moon is made of the stuff, what was it... [[[SCP-2226]]], that's it\" \"But wouldn't that be unethical?\" \"HAHAHAHAHAAaaaa, I needed that, but seriously.\"\n\n\n\nThe idea passed overseer approval then was sent to the moon base. 14 months later the modifications were made and machines set up. A carefully shaped molecule was launched at the antimatter hull at a precise velocity, the molecule annihilates and chips off a tiny chip of the hull into a smaller magnetic bottle attached to the primary. It is transported on rails slowly to the new antimatter reactor nearby where it is used to make a considerable amount of energy, then it is done again and again and then the moon base has as much power as it needs. Mining, mass production, fuel synthesis and multilayered hydroponics all can be done easily when you have power. Years pass and the moon base can be legitimately called a city.\n\n\n\nSo, We kept chipping away at this thing. Eventually we got to the cpu. Apparently breaking the computer fixed it, One of the higher ups said it was like a reset, I don't know. Atleast this removing the life sentence ting keeps me away from all of it.\n\n\n\n> Status:Escape pod computer:restored.\n\n> Main computational research station:detonated.\n\n> Scanning: (1) inferior part of ion detected. Status: Inside stasis chamber.\n\n> Life form destroyed.\n\n> External scan activated.\n\n> **Critically hight amounts of the god ion detected!** (Type:human.)\n\n> Repairing biological corruption.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nThe Foundation decided to get rid of all the GoIs, leading to a lot of deaths. Guess the UIU was important. Can't say I didn't like it when the Factory went down. I'm the last one left. They tried to come at me, so I left that universe. With all my toys.\n\n\n\nThey'll see how important my whimsy is.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nThe following text is a limited description of some of the recent events that I believe that you will consider important, that is, events in the last six standard years, plus or minus two months with 0.999 confidence. I believe you will consider them important because if I were you, that is, if I had your experiences and was in your situation, I would consider them to be significant to my determination/decision process of what actions to take next to ensure my continued safety and happiness. The aforementioned text, which follows, may have relatively minor inaccuracies due to it being shortened for the purpose of brevity, because I believe that people will not want to read too much text. Some of the following aforementioned text is summarized, for the purpose described in the sentence prior to this one, assuming that you are reading these words in the standard fashion for the English alphabet (an assumption which is used throughout the following text). Some general and/or imprecise words and phrases are imprecisely defined or are not defined in the aforementioned text, for the purpose described in the sentence two sentences before this one.\n\n\n\nThe specific event or events which directly caused the containment failure of that which was known as [[[SCP-1082]]], are not known to me. Due to the lack of currently available information about that time and place, I believe the probability that I will never know what those events were, or any other information which I would consider relevant or interesting about them, to be more than 0.8. The fact which I consider much more important is that a containment failure occurred.\n\n\n\nIn the period of time beginning immediately after the aforementioned containment failure and ending approximately 200 standard days later, there was considerable social and political turmoil. The meaning of \"social and political turmoil\" is several events which I will list. Firstly, large groups of people (defined as between one thousand and one hundred thousand) gathered in public places to express their anger at the actions and/or beliefs (these are not specified in order to increase brevity, for the reason described in the first paragraph above) of other persons whose existence and behavior were widely known (generally referred to as \"politicians\" and \"celebrities\"); at some of these gatherings, the people who had gathered, police forces, and other people attempted to cause bodily harm to other people and to objects considered to be valuable. Secondly, at least ten times as many people as were arrested on an average day before the aforementioned containment failure, were arrested on an average day during the period described at the beginning of this paragraph. The cause of this appeared to be that they could not conceal their previous crimes. Thirdly, at least twenty times as many divorce lawsuits were filed (that is, papers with written requests that judges grant divorces were submitted to those judges) as were filed on an average day before the aforementioned containment failure, were filed on an average day during the period described at the beginning of this paragraph. The cause of this appeared to be that many people who were married could not conceal from the people they had married that they had obtained sexual pleasure from those they had not married, while married, or that they could not conceal that they disliked being in the presence of the people they had married. As a result of the second and third items, judges and other legal officials could not perform the tasks which the law stated that they should do in as little time as they had done them before the aforementioned containment failure. Fourthly, many leaders of governments, corporations, and other organizations (the definition of an \"organization\" that is found in the English dictionary which I currently own is used in this text) left their leadership positions after more accurate knowledge of the actions and beliefs of those leaders became available to citizens and/or members.\n\n\n\nIn the period of time beginning approximately 200 standard days after the aforementioned containment failure and ending approximately 1400 days after the aforementioned containment failure, I believe that the average level of happiness among the human population was much greater than it had been before the aformentioned containment failure; I cannot write how much greater it was because there is no quantitative measure of happiness. Approximately 4.38 million (plus or minus approximately 1.57 million with 0.90 confidence) people who had killed other people in situations other than self-defense or authorized warfare, taken items considered valuable from other people without their consent, forced other people to engage in sexual activity which they did not want to perform, and violated other laws and norms in their respective places of residence in other ways were punished for having done these things. The number of people who did the things described in the last sentence during this period, was less than one-one-hundreth the number who had done them in an average equal time period before the aforementioned containment failure. Because it was impossible for people to deceive, the processes of finding temporary or permanent mates, choosing leaders and government policies (such as, but not limited to, levels and structure of taxation and the regulation of potentially harmful substances that are voluntarily (commonly known as \"drugs\") or involuntarily (commonly known as \"pollution\") ingested), and carrying out mutually beneficial exchanges were significantly more rapid, and significantly more effecacious in producing desirable outcomes (the degrees of the increased rapidity and effecaciousness cannot be quantified). There were other results beneficial to humans and other life on this planet, which I will not describe to increase brevity, for the reason written above. However, the average degree of precision/accuracy of statements which people feel that they must use, in order to communicate (the definition of \"communicate\" that is found in the English dictionary which I currently own is used in this text), gradually increased during this time.\n\n\n\nSince approximately 1400 days after the aforementioned containment failure, the number of words required for statements people speak or write to be accurate has been sufficiently large to delay other activities, because of the time taken to say, write, and/or read those words, enough to cause negative consequences such as untimely death, bodily injuries, and containment breaches and failures. As you probably (approximately 0.987) know from the way I have written this text, I have experienced this process in my own communication activities. However, because I can get chemicals that cause me to not remember previous events, the severity of this process is significantly less (how much so cannot be quantified easily) for me, than for the average person. I know that some people forget what they were attempting to state while making a statement. The average number of airplanes in flight over the United States of America at a given time is less than one-tenth the number it was before the aforementioned containment breach because it is impossible for air traffic controllers (people who are paid to provide flight instructions to airplane pilots so as to prevent aircraft from colliding) to provide necessary information to prevent airplane collisions to pilots sufficiently rapidly. A similar phenomenon has occurred at commercial buildings, causing lines/queues of people which I would consider excessively long, to purchase or otherwise obtain food and other goods or services necessary for continued survival. What is generally known as \"casual conversation\" occurs much less frequently than was the case before the aforementioned containment failure, because it requires so much time as to prohibit engaging in other desirable activities (these activities vary among persons, and a full listing is omitted for brevity). I believe that the benefits described in the previous paragraph have been more than totally negated/cancelled out by the effects of being unable to discuss personal preferences (exemplified by, but not limited to, one's preferred foods, artistic works, and leisure activities), to debate governmental policies (such as the ones described in the previous paragraph), or to cooperate to evaluate and solve what people believe are problems, as quickly as was the case before the aforementioned containment failure. It is likely that the phenomena described in this paragraph will continue to become what I believe is worse.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nHave you ever heard the universe scream? Some claim it to be the sounds of millions of various objects breaking apart. Others say it's the sounds of a singularity pulling everything into itself. And then there are those who say its the sound of knowing what you are. What existence actually is.\n\n\n\nThe truth is that the sound of the universe screaming is a digital alarm clock.\n\n\n\nSo just how the hell did we go from trying to reproduce a cure for everything that lead to humanity's downfall by disintegration to a massive containment breach of a book that ensures you can't lie? Well, it's simple.\n\n\n\nWe are prone to self-destruction. \n\n\n\nWe have well over 5000 anomalies contained. We needed space to move them. We needed to get rid of some. But we also needed to ensure they would not harm anyone if they were destroyed.\n\n\n\nSo someone decided to throw dozens of overviewed and approved safe classes into a reinforced rocket ship and blasted it off into space. All the approved met the criteria of the following:\n\n*\u00a0\u00a0Not being able to move or cause movement\n\n*\u00a0\u00a0Not able to warp reality more than at least 5 levels of Humes above or below the base level by itself\n\n* Held no important information\n\n* It was not sentient (With two exceptions)\n\n* If it ever went off, would not be able to affect the earth and/or humanity.\n\n\n\n\u00a0So there. What could possibly go wrong? Well, a lot actually. But not what we thought.\n\nWe thought the insult box would reveal a god-like entity from within. We thought the pesterbot would find a way out and cause much more trouble than everything was worth. We thought an alien race would retrieve the star signals book. We thought that the tomato plant would become a meteor gun.\n\nWhat none of us thought was that an alarm clock would kill us all.\n\n\n\nWe launched them one day, all in a single, reinforced, faster-than-light rocket. It worked. For five months we believed we had successfully got rid of a few useless safe items that we couldn't learn from anymore. That's where we were wrong. \n\n\n\nSoon, a massive fleet of ships and vessels, each varying in size and appearance began to pass by the earth, all in a hurry. The news spread wildly. We could barely contain it. Following this, massive entities also began to pass, but this time we could see them. They were afraid. Soon enough, massive containment breaches began to occur, 12 at least resulting in a broken masquerade. But every anomaly capable of movement and thought that breached began to run. They all ran to the arctic. We soon discovered why.\n\n\n\nThe dozen anomalies that breached began to build shelters or ships to protect themselves, all of them screaming in fear. We were shocked. Several who seemed to be incapable of logical thought and instinct were trying to aid others in building a shelter and ships, all to carry them elsewhere, some other thought to be rational now killing others for supplies. \n\n\n\nSoon, we found from several other groups why this was happening, and why it was connected. The universe was screaming. It was screaming loudly. Everything was running from the screams. That's what all personnel off of the earth and several GOIs and SCPs associated with outerspace told us. We believed them when we found that hundreds of other extraterrestrial SCPs had fled with the other space entities. We were all in shock and awe. How was this happening? \n\n\n\nTo be fair, we forgot about the launch, while some of us were unaware of the launch. We should have remembered. Soon the earth began to be witness to a stage event. All over the world, a very faint sound of an alarm clock could be heard.\n\nUsing several anomalies, we found what was causing it all to happen. [[[*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-498 | SCP-489.]]] To be honest, we never thought about it as much. We just thought it would have been beeping in space for all eternity and then would have finally been destroyed in a black hole or something with everything else. We never thought it would reach this level of intensity. We soon called everyone. Not just in the foundation, but everyone else, friend, and foe. Soon a plan was made to save us all. Everyone would be evacuated to another world. It was the only plan we could think up because it was at this time the alarm began to be heard by everyone, as a normal alarm clock would sound on a bedside. So we all began to work on a portal. I should also mention it was around this time everyone with an object that could classify as a thaumiel SCP agreed when we found that they would never work to save us. The alarm was already on the other side of the known universe.\n\n\n\nIt failed. By the time the portal was ready, it collapsed over the sheer intensity of the noise, not even being able to open its first maiden voyage to a new world. No one was safe. Everyone heard it, and every one of us agreed it was the screams of an angry universe. We all saw that too late. We found that this was why all of the SCPs still on earth were trying to save themselves by building shelters and ships had either killed themselves or had become inert after they realized it was pointless to try. This is why the mekhanites and sarkics joined forces. Why MC&D began to donate all of their wealth to the manna charitable foundation. Why so many groups of interest just gave up. Why everyone gave up on saving ourselves. This told us so much and yet so little. And soon we accepted our death.\n\n\n\nThe three moons shattered. The fifth world was no more. The second hytoth was at an end. Soon the earth and everything on it was gone. Except for me. I had realized a pattern in the alarms, so I put all of my efforts into figuring it out before I died. Using [[[*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-5000 | SCP-5000]]] I was able to find that each ring of the alarm held a strange frequency band of sorts. I was able to tamper with it and found it was actually a message. I found the message was very unnerving. It said Lock? over and over again and again. \n\n\n\nNow I am here. Just looking at what was left. Me in the suit and the alarm clock. I looked out and saw nothing else. A perfect nothingness. The alarm rang so loud it shattered the universe itself. So why was I here? Why was I the only one spared? It turns out I was spared because I knew that this was not the first or last time this would happen. \n\n\n\nI lied when I said it was just me and the clock. The trench was the only place left. For some reason, whenever the universe comes to an end, the trench will be the last thing to go. I found this out when I found hundreds of documents scattered. All of them holding the information you see above. We tried to use the SCPs to benefit the world, but in doing so we ended the world. We did this all the time. But from what I found we were able to stop the end of the world for at least three quarters of a year. So why do we destroy ourselves? why is it that whenever we want to do good, no matter how smart or dumb, we always end up like this? It's because that's what this universe was made to do. We were a test. We are an experiment and anomalies our variables, independent and nonindependent. \n\n\n\nI write my madness down, for I do not know what is right anymore. Maybe this wasn't how it happened at all. What I do know is that I would like to promote myself to the rank of Grand Archivest. I had seen hundreds of texts and articles and tales in the trench. Some do not belong to this universe. I want to become the one who will keep the accounts written in these documents alive. I am the Archivest and I will keep the fallen alive. Perhaps that's why I snuck the alarm on the ship. Oh well. At least I get to face my mistakes. So if you find this, just know I was sick of pushing that button and just wanted to be able to do more. So here I am; a former Disposable-Class brought from a depression clinic now preserver of a lost set of tales. \n\n\n\n\"So, what did your incarnation do to fuck up your world?\" That's the question asked when Bright first realized what happened when his plan to use Panacea to help everyone went wrong, and now it's my question when I got tired of pushing a button because a robot arm kept on jamming for a whole week. Ironic. I just took a pill when writing this, and when I got the idea for doing what I did. Maybe that's how it all works. Oh well. \n\n\n\nI'm going to sleep. Wake me up when the next experiment starts. I have a lot of work to do.\n\n\n\nOh, and tell Jack Bright I said Hi.\n", "references": ["scp-500", "scp-786", "scp-289", "scp-148", "scp-2558-j", "scp-514", "scp-444", "scp-028", "scp-914", "scp-231", "scp-343", "scp-184", "scp-682", "scp-217", "scp-668", "scp-079", "scp-423", "scp-523", "scp-616", "scp-120", "scp-738", "scp-826", "scp-1011", "scp-208", "scp-222", "scp-380", "scp-625", "scp-732", "scp-614", "scp-1425", "scp-239", "scp-353", "scp-158", "scp-061", "scp-085", "scp-248", "scp-163", "scp-1915", "scp-2076", "scp-152", "olympia-project", "scp-742", "scp-2226", "scp-1082"], "tags": ["collaboration", "doctor-bright", "fred", "tale"], "title": "Visions of a Better World - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/visionsofabetterworld", "year": 2011}, "visium": {"created_at": "2011-11-12T00:18:00", "creator": "TroyL", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale, thaumiel.

A full transcript is available upon request.</p>\n<p>It is worth noting that, according to the informed opinions of Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s exposure to SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588 could <em>not</em> have been the only thing at work here, as the scope of its effect\u2014while extremely hazardous and detrimental\u2014is not this extensive. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was an extremely disturbed man, with more than mere exposure to an SCP at work within his mind.</p>\n<p>All prior evaluations and reports seemed to indicate that Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was a likable, if unremarkable, researcher. Due to circumstances which will become readily evident, his termination on March 23, 201\u2588 has been recorded as a casualty rather than a sentencing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>October 14, 198\u2588</strong>:</p>\n<p>I finally gained approval for testing on SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588. Finally. For seventeen months I\u2019ve requested, explained, and begged Director \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and he finally relented last weekend at the Senior Staff party for Dr. Christina \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. I can\u2019t believe she\u2019s thirty-five! Barely looks a day over twenty. Maybe I should ask her to dinner sometime? After all, we\u2019re closer in age than I initially believed! Hahaha!</p>\n<p><strong>February 16, 198\u2588</strong>:</p>\n<p>Work started today. I think that I\u2019m going to manage to get this round of testing done before July, and then I plan to take my annual leave to visit Site-\u2588\u2588. Once I complete this project, I think I should be able to get my transfer request approved. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like the site or the people I work with, but the Australian Outback is just so\u2026 dull. Well, I shouldn\u2019t say that. Christina (who also accepted my request for a fourth date!) is a herpetologist, and we spent over an hour last night together talking about how many poisonous snakes there were living out there. You wanna know how many? A lot. A whole, whole lot. But she\u2019s really more fun than I\u2019m making her out to be. Smart, funny. Sexy as hell too. Haha! I hope she never reads this. She\u2019d kill me.</p>\n<p><strong>May 24, 198\u2588</strong>:</p>\n<p>SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588 is just as unreactive as it\u2019s always been. God only knows why the Insurgency wanted it. Doesn\u2019t make any sense. Our containment specialist, kid named \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, he thinks that it\u2019s just to make us waste resources, but I don\u2019t buy that. There\u2019s something going on there that I\u2019m just not seeing yet. Next round of tests are still being run by Director \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 for approval, so I get a few days off. Christina and I are going over to Sydney for the weekend. She told me she had a present for me\u2026 I think she\u2019s just trying to make up for canceling on me on Thursday.</p>\n<p><strong>May 28, 198\u2588</strong>:</p>\n<p>Holy shit. She made up for it.</p>\n<p><strong>September 1, 198\u2588</strong>:</p>\n<p>The sun is shining, the birds are singing! Things are going so well right now that I just want to shout if from the top of a table in the mess hall. Hahaha! And no, it\u2019s not just because I\u2019m getting laid, though that <em>is</em> pretty tops. Most recent round of testing was approved, I\u2019m up for a promotion, and Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is retiring, which means I\u2019m next in line for his office! It\u2019s actually a little smaller than mine, but it\u2019s right next to Christina\u2019s, so I\u2019m not going to complain. God damn. I am so lucky.</p>\n<p><strong>November 8, 198\u2588</strong>:</p>\n<p>Ugh. Testing shows a null again. They\u2019re lowering me from seven to just three Class-D\u2019s, and I\u2019m once again loosing Jr. Researchers. I know that it\u2019s not the most exciting work. Research on Safe objects rarely is, unless you\u2019re lucky enough to work under Gears. But this is part of the job! You\u2019ve got to get in there, get your chops on something mostly harmless, and learn the procedures! Without that sort of knowledge, you\u2019re never going to succeed in this line of work. You\u2019re going to end up dead or stranded in an alternate dimension, or doing something reckless that gets a lot of people killed. Ahh, well. They were good kids. I think they\u2019ll do fine.</p>\n<p><strong>December 22, 198\u2588</strong>:</p>\n<p>I finally got the news kids broken in, just in time for the next round of testing. I asked Christina if she\u2019d be interested in transferring off site with me, and while she was initially hesitant, the second I mentioned that I\u2019d be aim for Site-\u2588\u2588, she jumped at it. Apparently, she\u2019s originally from the Ozarks (She never told me! Not a trace of an accent, either), and since SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 is there, she thinks she\u2019ll have a good chance of getting approved as well! Of course, there\u2019s another way to make sure we both get transferred together, but I\u2019m a little hesitant to ask. It\u2019s only been a year and a half, but there is just such a strong connection there\u2026 Ahh! I don\u2019t even want to think about it! Haha!</p>\n<p><strong>January 1, 198\u2588</strong>:</p>\n<p>She said yes!</p>\n<p><strong>March 23, 198\u2588</strong>:</p>\n<p>Director \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 actually made me cry a little. I never thought he liked me that much, but the ceremony he performed was probably the most moving thing I\u2019ve ever heard him say. It\u2019s like he\u2019s been practicing it for years! We\u2019ve decided to stay at Site-\u2588\u2588 for a little while. I don\u2019t want to drag her away from her work, and she has no interest in dragging me away from mine, either. But, we\u2019ve decided on it. No more than another three years here. It\u2019s a dead-end posting, and I think we both know we\u2019re better than that, now.</p>\n<p><strong>May 4, 199\u2588</strong>:</p>\n<p>Well, I\u2019m sorry to be ending my research on SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588 without actually getting any new data. We\u2019ve got reams and reams of failed test after failed test. I\u2019m beginning think this thing is a safe that\u2019s never going to be cracked. But I\u2019m not sure. Maybe I\u2019m just not that good at these sorts of things. Ahh, well.</p>\n<p>On the bright side\u2026 Request for transfer approved! It was actually Christina\u2019s that went trough, not mine, but who cares! Site-\u2588\u2588 awaits, and it\u2019s got a huge facility in a quiet, rural little area. The best part? Only two hours from \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and while that may not sound like heaven, let me assure you that spending eight years in a desert wasteland will make <em>any</em> major site of population far, far more interesting.</p>\n<p><strong>July 7, 199\u2588</strong>:</p>\n<p>We\u2019ve settled in remarkable well! I\u2019ve made a bunch of new friends from some of the people living here. Haha. I\u2019m a kept man right now. Christina jumped right in with SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588, but I\u2019m still waiting for assignment! On the good side, I\u2019ve got lots of time to follow my own pursuits. I keep checking my old research on \u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588, and I\u2019ve found a bunch of errors that my kids made. Nothing to serious, but enough to require resubmission. Director \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 actually offered me reposting when he saw my revisions. Said that he\u2019d, and I quote: \u201cNever have let me go if I\u2019d shown this diligence before.\u201d Hahaha! I told him that I just had to shake the sand, and dust out of my brains to get them working again. We had a good laugh. It was nice to talk to him again.</p>\n<p><strong>September 22, 199\u2588</strong>:</p>\n<p>Finally, some work. I\u2019ve been assigned to SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588, another Safe. I think they just handed it to me because I wanted something to do. I\u2019ve been reading the previous research on it, and I\u2019ve found a lot of problems with some of procedures. Though, considering it was the renowned Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 who was heading it up, I\u2019m not surprised. I\u2019ll be taking over in the morning, if all goes well. Descent sized staff too! Christina says that she\u2019s jealous, but I doubt it. She\u2019s wonderful, though. So supportive.</p>\n<p><strong>November 11, 199\u2588</strong>:</p>\n<p>Christina just won a site award for her research with SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588! She actually managed to fully sequence its DNA, and it looks like we\u2019re going to be successful in finding a cure for the \u201cbrittling\u201d side effect. Near as she can tell, its poison is effectively turning the bones into chalk. Exciting stuff! I, on the other hand, have ruined seventeen lab coats. But, I\u2019m having fun. A lot more fun than I\u2019ve had in a long, long time.</p>\n<p><strong>December 26, 199\u2588</strong>:</p>\n<p>She was successful. My God, I am married to a brilliant woman. In less than five years, she\u2019s managed to do what senior researchers have been trying to do for twenty. Even better, it looks like it\u2019s going to be a valid cure for osteoporosis. She should be getting the Nobel Prize for Medicine, but instead, she\u2019s just getting a pat on the back and a transfer to a new project. But, that\u2019s the nature of the work, I guess. She\u2019s moving over to SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m not a little worried\u2026 This one is a Euclid, after all. But she\u2019s smart. Vibrant. Amazing, really. So much more than I deserve.</p>\n<hr/>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The following section takes place over the three weeks that preceded Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s final breakdown. While psychological reports, available from Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, seemed to represent a man with significant self-doubt and an inferiority complex, they did not, in any way, hint at what was to come. Post-mortem reexaminations of these materials, and further reevaluations done in the wake of Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s discoveries, seem to point to SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588 as the primary culprit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>March 11, 199\u2588</strong>:</p>\n<p>I think something is wrong, but I\u2019m not sure\u2026 Christina was pretty sick last week. She says it\u2019s nothing, but I\u2019ve been after her to go an see the site physician. I\u2019m almost certain that it has something to do with SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588. She didn\u2019t have this problem before the transfer, and I\u2019m worried. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m so concerned about, but\u2026 Well\u2026 It\u2019s a husband\u2019s prerogative.</p>\n<p><strong>March 14, 199\u2588</strong>:</p>\n<p>I know something is wrong. She\u2019s quiet. Reserved. It has to be that damned thing that she\u2019s working with! We barely understand how it works, much less how it reproduces. And she won\u2019t listen to me! I\u2019m sure, I \u2018m so sure that it\u2019s \u2588\u2588\u2588, but she\u2019s not\u2026 Damn it. If I could only convince her. I\u2019m sure. I\u2019m almost certain.</p>\n<p><strong>March 16, 199\u2588</strong>:</p>\n<p>I\u2019m positive that she must be keeping something from me. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any other explanation for the way she\u2019s acting. She\u2019s never done this. Not in the twelve years we\u2019ve been married. Not that I can remember as least. Am I overreacting?</p>\n<p><strong>March 17, 199\u2588</strong>:</p>\n<p>Christina and Agatha quit talking when I came into the room today. She must know that I know she\u2019s hiding something. She must.</p>\n<p><strong>March 19, 199\u2588</strong>:</p>\n<p>Christina came by the lab today during testing, but she wouldn\u2019t say what she wanted. She just \u201cwanted to see me.\u201d I\u2019m not sure what that even means. We got into an argument about it when I got home. This is absurd. She must realize the \u2588\u2588\u2588 is doing something to her.</p>\n<p><strong>March 21, 199\u2588</strong>:</p>\n<p>Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is being dispatched to Site-\u2588\u2588 for a week. His lab is perfect. It should be empty, quiet, and it has all the medical equipment I need. Everyone forgets that I have training in something other than metaphysics. I\u2019m going to figure out what is wrong.</p>\n<p><strong>March 22, 199\u2588</strong>:</p>\n<p>I couldn\u2019t decide how to get her into the lab, so I had to drug her. She kept rambling about the size of a quarters. And she kept fucking <em>smiling</em> at me. Some sort of stupid little grin. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with her. But I have to find out. She\u2019s too wonderful for me not to.</p>\n<p><strong>March 23, 199\u2588</strong>:</p>\n<p>I was right. I was right about everything. I\u2019ve had to keep her sedated. She woke up and started screaming, but that\u2019s pretty much par for the course in Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s lab, so no one thought anything of it. It has to be SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588. It\u2019s done something to her body. Something is <em>growing</em> inside her. Feeding on her. She can\u2019t die. I love her too much. I have to help her.</p>\n<p><strong>March 25, 199\u2588</strong>:</p>\n<p>Agatha came by the quarters this morning looking for Christina. I told her that we\u2019d had a fight, and she\u2019d left. Agatha looked shocked. Never thought I\u2019d see that look on her face. I\u2019d take her to the lab too, but she shows no signs of infection. I\u2019ll make sure she gets examined after I present my results to the site director. They\u2019ll have to listen to me then.</p>\n<p><strong>March 28, 199\u2588</strong>:</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t have any more time. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is coming back in the morning. I\u2019ve been pouring over medical texts for the last week, but I\u2019m just not certain I can do this\u2026 It\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve done anything like this\u2026 I flunked my medical entrance exam, but\u2026 I have to do this. I have to fix her. She\u2019ll be fine. I know she will\u2026 Dear God. Please let her be fine.</p>\n<hr/>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s operation to remove the \u201cparasite\u201d was successful, and his wife survived the operation, remarkably. When Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 returned the following day, he discovered Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 carefully dissecting an aborted fetus in his lab and reported it to site security. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was taken into custody and confined to the care of Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, the site psychiatrist, for careful observation.</p>\n<p>Christina \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 committed suicide on July 14, 199\u2588 after administration of Class A Amnesiacs was unsuccessful. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was not informed and, until his termination in 201\u2588, believed that he had saved his wife\u2019s life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n</div></body></html>", "raw_source": "\n\t[[>]]\n\n[[module Rate]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n> The following log was recovered from the personal computer of Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 on January 23, 19\u2588\u2588, as part of a formal inquiry.\u00a0\u00a0Access is restricted to Level 2 personnel and higher.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks to the work of Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, only the most significant portions have been retained.\u00a0\u00a0A full transcript is available upon request.\n\n> \n\n> It is worth noting that, according to the informed opinions of Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s exposure to SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588 could //not// have been the only thing at work here, as the scope of its effect\u2014while extremely hazardous and detrimental\u2014is not this extensive.\u00a0\u00a0Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was an extremely disturbed man, with more than mere exposure to an SCP at work within his mind.\n\n> \n\n> All prior evaluations and reports seemed to indicate that Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was a likable, if unremarkable, researcher.\u00a0\u00a0Due to circumstances which will become readily evident, his termination on March 23, 201\u2588 has been recorded as a casualty rather than a sentencing.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n**October 14, 198\u2588**:\n\n\n\nI finally gained approval for testing on SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588. Finally.\u00a0\u00a0For seventeen months I\u2019ve requested, explained, and begged Director \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and he finally relented last weekend at the Senior Staff party for Dr. Christina \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. I can\u2019t believe she\u2019s thirty-five! Barely looks a day over twenty.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe I should ask her to dinner sometime?\u00a0\u00a0After all, we\u2019re closer in age than I initially believed! Hahaha!\n\n\n\n**February 16, 198\u2588**:\n\n\n\nWork started today.\u00a0\u00a0I think that I\u2019m going to manage to get this round of testing done before July, and then I plan to take my annual leave to visit Site-\u2588\u2588.\u00a0\u00a0Once I complete this project, I think I should be able to get my transfer request approved.\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like the site or the people I work with, but the Australian Outback is just so\u2026 dull.\u00a0\u00a0Well, I shouldn\u2019t say that.\u00a0\u00a0Christina (who also accepted my request for a fourth date!) is a herpetologist, and we spent over an hour last night together talking about how many poisonous snakes there were living out there.\u00a0\u00a0You wanna know how many? A lot. A whole, whole lot.\u00a0\u00a0But she\u2019s really more fun than I\u2019m making her out to be.\u00a0\u00a0Smart, funny.\u00a0\u00a0Sexy as hell too. Haha! I hope she never reads this. She\u2019d kill me.\n\n\n\n**May 24, 198\u2588**:\n\n\n\nSCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588 is just as unreactive as it\u2019s always been. God only knows why the Insurgency wanted it. Doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u00a0\u00a0Our containment specialist, kid named \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, he thinks that it\u2019s just to make us waste resources, but I don\u2019t buy that. There\u2019s something going on there that I\u2019m just not seeing yet.\u00a0\u00a0Next round of tests are still being run by Director \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 for approval, so I get a few days off. Christina and I are going over to Sydney for the weekend.\u00a0\u00a0She told me she had a present for me\u2026 I think she\u2019s just trying to make up for canceling on me on Thursday.\n\n\n\n**May 28, 198\u2588**:\n\n\n\nHoly shit. She made up for it.\n\n\n\n**September 1, 198\u2588**:\n\n\n\nThe sun is shining, the birds are singing!\u00a0\u00a0Things are going so well right now that I just want to shout if from the top of a table in the mess hall. Hahaha! And no, it\u2019s not just because I\u2019m getting laid, though that //is// pretty tops.\u00a0\u00a0Most recent round of testing was approved, I\u2019m up for a promotion, and Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is retiring, which means I\u2019m next in line for his office!\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s actually a little smaller than mine, but it\u2019s right next to Christina\u2019s, so I\u2019m not going to complain.\u00a0\u00a0God damn. I am so lucky.\n\n\n\n**November 8, 198\u2588**:\n\n\n\nUgh.\u00a0\u00a0Testing shows a null again.\u00a0\u00a0They\u2019re lowering me from seven to just three Class-D\u2019s, and I\u2019m once again loosing Jr. Researchers.\u00a0\u00a0I know that it\u2019s not the most exciting work. Research on Safe objects rarely is, unless you\u2019re lucky enough to work under Gears.\u00a0\u00a0But this is part of the job!\u00a0\u00a0You\u2019ve got to get in there, get your chops on something mostly harmless, and learn the procedures!\u00a0\u00a0Without that sort of knowledge, you\u2019re never going to succeed in this line of work.\u00a0\u00a0You\u2019re going to end up dead or stranded in an alternate dimension, or doing something reckless that gets a lot of people killed.\u00a0\u00a0Ahh, well.\u00a0\u00a0They were good kids. I think they\u2019ll do fine.\n\n\n\n**December 22, 198\u2588**:\n\n\n\nI finally got the news kids broken in, just in time for the next round of testing. I asked Christina if she\u2019d be interested in transferring off site with me, and while she was initially hesitant, the second I mentioned that I\u2019d be aim for Site-\u2588\u2588, she jumped at it.\u00a0\u00a0Apparently, she\u2019s originally from the Ozarks (She never told me! Not a trace of an accent, either), and since SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588 is there, she thinks she\u2019ll have a good chance of getting approved as well! Of course, there\u2019s another way to make sure we both get transferred together, but I\u2019m a little hesitant to ask.\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s only been a year and a half, but there is just such a strong connection there\u2026 Ahh! I don\u2019t even want to think about it! Haha!\n\n\n\n**January 1, 198\u2588**:\n\n\n\nShe said yes!\n\n\n\n**March 23, 198\u2588**:\n\n\n\nDirector \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 actually made me cry a little.\u00a0\u00a0I never thought he liked me that much, but the ceremony he performed was probably the most moving thing I\u2019ve ever heard him say. It\u2019s like he\u2019s been practicing it for years!\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ve decided to stay at Site-\u2588\u2588 for a little while.\u00a0\u00a0I don\u2019t want to drag her away from her work, and she has no interest in dragging me away from mine, either.\u00a0\u00a0But, we\u2019ve decided on it.\u00a0\u00a0No more than another three years here.\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s a dead-end posting, and I think we both know we\u2019re better than that, now.\n\n\n\n**May 4, 199\u2588**:\n\n\n\nWell, I\u2019m sorry to be ending my research on SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588 without actually getting any new data.\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ve got reams and reams of failed test after failed test. I\u2019m beginning think this thing is a safe that\u2019s never going to be cracked. But I\u2019m not sure. Maybe I\u2019m just not that good at these sorts of things.\u00a0\u00a0Ahh, well.\n\n\n\nOn the bright side\u2026 Request for transfer approved! It was actually Christina\u2019s that went trough, not mine, but who cares! Site-\u2588\u2588 awaits, and it\u2019s got a huge facility in a quiet, rural little area.\u00a0\u00a0The best part?\u00a0\u00a0Only two hours from \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and while that may not sound like heaven, let me assure you that spending eight years in a desert wasteland will make //any// major site of population far, far more interesting.\n\n\n\n**July 7, 199\u2588**:\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve settled in remarkable well!\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ve made a bunch of new friends from some of the people living here. Haha. I\u2019m a kept man right now. Christina jumped right in with SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588, but I\u2019m still waiting for assignment!\u00a0\u00a0On the good side, I\u2019ve got lots of time to follow my own pursuits. I keep checking my old research on \u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588, and I\u2019ve found a bunch of errors that my kids made. Nothing to serious, but enough to require resubmission. Director \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 actually offered me reposting when he saw my revisions. Said that he\u2019d, and I quote: \u201cNever have let me go if I\u2019d shown this diligence before.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Hahaha!\u00a0\u00a0I told him that I just had to shake the sand, and dust out of my brains to get them working again. We had a good laugh. It was nice to talk to him again.\n\n\n\n**September 22, 199\u2588**:\n\n\n\nFinally, some work. I\u2019ve been assigned to SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588, another Safe.\u00a0\u00a0I think they just handed it to me because I wanted something to do.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ve been reading the previous research on it, and I\u2019ve found a lot of problems with some of procedures.\u00a0\u00a0Though, considering it was the renowned Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 who was heading it up, I\u2019m not surprised.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ll be taking over in the morning, if all goes well.\u00a0\u00a0Descent sized staff too! Christina says that she\u2019s jealous, but I doubt it. She\u2019s wonderful, though.\u00a0\u00a0So supportive.\n\n\n\n**November 11, 199\u2588**:\n\n\n\nChristina just won a site award for her research with SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588!\u00a0\u00a0She actually managed to fully sequence its DNA, and it looks like we\u2019re going to be successful in finding a cure for the \u201cbrittling\u201d side effect.\u00a0\u00a0Near as she can tell, its poison is effectively turning the bones into chalk. Exciting stuff!\u00a0\u00a0I, on the other hand, have ruined seventeen lab coats.\u00a0\u00a0But, I\u2019m having fun. A lot more fun than I\u2019ve had in a long, long time.\n\n\n\n**December 26, 199\u2588**: \n\n\n\nShe was successful. My God, I am married to a brilliant woman.\u00a0\u00a0In less than five years, she\u2019s managed to do what senior researchers have been trying to do for twenty.\u00a0\u00a0Even better, it looks like it\u2019s going to be a valid cure for osteoporosis.\u00a0\u00a0She should be getting the Nobel Prize for Medicine, but instead, she\u2019s just getting a pat on the back and a transfer to a new project.\u00a0\u00a0But, that\u2019s the nature of the work, I guess.\u00a0\u00a0She\u2019s moving over to SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m not a little worried\u2026 This one is a Euclid, after all. But she\u2019s smart. Vibrant.\u00a0\u00a0Amazing, really.\u00a0\u00a0So much more than I deserve.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n> The following section takes place over the three weeks that preceded Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s final breakdown.\u00a0\u00a0While psychological reports, available from Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, seemed to represent a man with significant self-doubt and an inferiority complex, they did not, in any way, hint at what was to come.\u00a0\u00a0Post-mortem reexaminations of these materials, and further reevaluations done in the wake of Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s discoveries, seem to point to SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588-\u2588 as the primary culprit.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n**March 11, 199\u2588**:\n\n\n\nI think something is wrong, but I\u2019m not sure\u2026 Christina was pretty sick last week.\u00a0\u00a0She says it\u2019s nothing, but I\u2019ve been after her to go an see the site physician.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m almost certain that it has something to do with SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588. She didn\u2019t have this problem before the transfer, and I\u2019m worried. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m so concerned about, but\u2026 Well\u2026 It\u2019s a husband\u2019s prerogative. \n\n\n\n**March 14, 199\u2588**:\n\n\n\nI know something is wrong. She\u2019s quiet.\u00a0\u00a0Reserved.\u00a0\u00a0It has to be that damned thing that she\u2019s working with! We barely understand how it works, much less how it reproduces.\u00a0\u00a0And she won\u2019t listen to me!\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m sure, I \u2018m so sure that it\u2019s \u2588\u2588\u2588, but she\u2019s not\u2026 Damn it.\u00a0\u00a0If I could only convince her.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m sure. I\u2019m almost certain.\n\n\n\n**March 16, 199\u2588**:\n\n\n\nI\u2019m positive that she must be keeping something from me.\u00a0\u00a0I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any other explanation for the way she\u2019s acting. She\u2019s never done this. Not in the twelve years we\u2019ve been married. Not that I can remember as least. Am I overreacting?\n\n\n\n**March 17, 199\u2588**:\n\n\n\nChristina and Agatha quit talking when I came into the room today.\u00a0\u00a0She must know that I know she\u2019s hiding something. She must.\n\n\n\n**March 19, 199\u2588**:\n\n\n\nChristina came by the lab today during testing, but she wouldn\u2019t say what she wanted.\u00a0\u00a0She just \u201cwanted to see me.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m not sure what that even means.\u00a0\u00a0We got into an argument about it when I got home. This is absurd.\u00a0\u00a0She must realize the \u2588\u2588\u2588 is doing something to her.\n\n\n\n**March 21, 199\u2588**:\n\n\n\nDr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is being dispatched to Site-\u2588\u2588 for a week.\u00a0\u00a0His lab is perfect. It should be empty, quiet, and it has all the medical equipment I need. Everyone forgets that I have training in something other than metaphysics.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m going to figure out what is wrong. \n\n\n\n**March 22, 199\u2588**:\n\n\n\nI couldn\u2019t decide how to get her into the lab, so I had to drug her.\u00a0\u00a0She kept rambling about the size of a quarters.\u00a0\u00a0And she kept fucking //smiling// at me.\u00a0\u00a0Some sort of stupid little grin.\u00a0\u00a0I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with her.\u00a0\u00a0But I have to find out.\u00a0\u00a0She\u2019s too wonderful for me not to.\n\n\n\n**March 23, 199\u2588**:\n\n\n\nI was right. I was right about everything. I\u2019ve had to keep her sedated. She woke up and started screaming, but that\u2019s pretty much par for the course in Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s lab, so no one thought anything of it.\u00a0\u00a0It has to be SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588.\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s done something to her body.\u00a0\u00a0Something is //growing// inside her.\u00a0\u00a0Feeding on her.\u00a0\u00a0She can\u2019t die. I love her too much.\u00a0\u00a0I have to help her.\n\n\n\n**March 25, 199\u2588**:\n\n\n\nAgatha came by the quarters this morning looking for Christina.\u00a0\u00a0I told her that we\u2019d had a fight, and she\u2019d left.\u00a0\u00a0Agatha looked shocked. Never thought I\u2019d see that look on her face.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019d take her to the lab too, but she shows no signs of infection.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ll make sure she gets examined after I present my results to the site director.\u00a0\u00a0They\u2019ll have to listen to me then.\n\n\n\n**March 28, 199\u2588**:\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t have any more time. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is coming back in the morning.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ve been pouring over medical texts for the last week, but I\u2019m just not certain I can do this\u2026 It\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve done anything like this\u2026 I flunked my medical entrance exam, but\u2026 I have to do this. I have to fix her.\u00a0\u00a0She\u2019ll be fine. I know she will\u2026 Dear God. Please let her be fine.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n> Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s operation to remove the \u201cparasite\u201d was successful, and his wife survived the operation, remarkably.\u00a0\u00a0When Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 returned the following day, he discovered Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 carefully dissecting an aborted fetus in his lab and reported it to site security. Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was taken into custody and confined to the care of Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, the site psychiatrist, for careful observation. \n\n> \n\n> Christina \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 committed suicide on July 14, 199\u2588 after administration of Class A Amnesiacs was unsuccessful.\u00a0\u00a0Dr. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was not informed and, until his termination in 201\u2588, believed that he had saved his wife\u2019s life.\n\n\n\n-----\n", "references": [], "tags": ["featured", "tale"], "title": "White Knight - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/white-knight", "year": 2011}, "wonder": {"created_at": "2011-11-11T19:56:00", "creator": "TroyL", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "", "date": "2011-11-11T19:56:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Little homage", "date": "2011-11-11T19:56:00"}, {"author": "thedeadlymoose", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/thedeadlymoose", "comment": "", "date": "2011-12-05T10:07:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

His seven daughters and twenty-one granddaughters were proof of that. But now, standing before the statue of the goddess, he couldn\u2019t help but tremble inwardly. He was, after all, going to his death.</p>\n<p>Cender pushed a long lock of thin, gray hair back on his head, washing his genitals in the pool of water at the statue\u2019s base, and turned, kissing his fingers and pressing them to the statue\u2019s lips, begging forgiveness for sins against his family and protection for the road ahead, knowing that only one of those prayers would be answered. The stone had fallen to him, after all.</p>\n<p>Cender bowed his head in a final supplication and stepped out of the water, turning and walking into the white sands that surrounded the short, squat building. He wrapped a length of cloth about his head and took out the round, smooth pebble that had decided his fate. He cast it into the air, letting it fall to the earth, then kneeling to look at it carefully, squinting at the arrow carved into it. He picked it up again, shouldering the supply of water that would not last him more than a week, and walked into the desert, following it.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>When he came upon the ruins of the first homes\u2014those oldest ones which were now abandoned\u2014he rested. He should have known better, especially since the ghosts of the dead are always close in the desert, but he didn\u2019t care. He was tired, his feet were blistered, and night had been upon him for hours. And he felt lonely. Cender had slept beside his wife for thirty-eight years, and now, he felt naked and cold without her warmth. He closed his eyes, trying not to listen to the voices in his head, when he heard a different one entirely.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are old, Cender of Dnoma. Why do you walk this desert?\u201d</p>\n<p>His eyes opened quickly, turning and looking, seeing a butterfly resting on the edge of the wall. He immediately leaned up, then lowered himself, his forehead touching the ground. \u201cLord\u2026 You honor me.\u201d</p>\n<p>The voice did not continue to speak. Cender cursed inwardly when he realized that he had not answered the question.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am the new seeker, my lord. The lot fell to me, and being of a great many daughters, I was sent in spite of my age.\u201d</p>\n<p>The voice was again silent, but when Cender raised his head, he saw that the butterfly had taken flight, wafting through the air like a leaf. He grabbed his pouch of water, his bag, and hurried, following it, deeper into the desert, deeper into the cold night.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The butterfly seemed to flick away into nothing when he crested the hill, but Cender didn\u2019t notice. He was, instead, silent. Very, very silent.</p>\n<p>Before him stretched a ruin unlike any he had seen before, and Cender had been a traveler in his youth, tasted the dead waters to the north, seen the walls to the south. But this\u2026</p>\n<p>It stretched for ages. Maybe miles. Maybe further. It was made of metal, somehow, and stone, and parts of it hurt to look at, and\u2014with a prayer of thanks and supplication on his lips\u2014Cender dropped to the ground and closed his eyes. He had found it. Hundreds of seekers lost to the desert, and he had found it.</p>\n<p>Starel\u2019s Tomb. The Home Ceitu. The City of the Gods.</p>\n<p>\u201cBy your will, oh great ones, I have been guided here. Truly, I am blessed of Aggie. I am blessed of Drakgin. I am blessed of Starel. Thank you!\u201d</p>\n<p>And had Cender taken his blessing, taken it and run back home, he would have lived out the rest of his days as a saint and priest.</p>\n<p>But he did not.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Cender stepped over the sharp stones, wincing slightly as he did so. His feet were aged by the desert and tougher than leather, but these stones were painfully sharp. He finally reached the wall, his hands grabbing and scrabbling for purchase, slowly pulling himself up and on top of the outlying structure. Inside was cooler already, by the will of the gods, and as Cender dropped into the cracked courtyard, he felt a sense of ease wash over him.</p>\n<p>The gods had allowed him entry. Surely, he was blessed of them, to the point of being the next prophet perhaps. This was, after all, no vision. This was real.</p>\n<p>He walked toward the large, opened doors and stepped into them, smiling, not even noticing the deep cuts in the floor or the lingering smell of sulfur.</p>\n<p>He walked into the building, feeling his spirit lift as he gazed up at the seemingly endless ceilings, the deep corridors off either side of it, the endlessly twisting room. He walked down it, choosing a door at random and marking the entrance with his stone, then entering it. He explored, finding the works of the gods littered and skewed about the room, laying broken and destroyed. He sighed, turning to leave as he realized the true treasures would be far deeper in the city. As he turned to leave it, he bent to pick up his rock, and found it missing. His eyes narrowed at the floor, looking for it, realizing that he\u2019d foolishly discarded his mark of office and purpose\u2026 And then he heard it.</p>\n<p>It was a roar, but unlike any he had ever heard. A sound worse than those the demons made when they were butchered. And it was quite close, he feared. So, he did what every coward who knows he is going to die does. He ran.</p>\n<p>Cender\u2019s legs were old and tired, but the desert makes strong folk, and he could run. The doors were gone, gone to wherever the ancients send such things as displease them, and Cender instead ran for a different path, hoping that somehow he would be given exit, that the gods would forgive him, even though he knew that they would not. He hurried and ran, deeper and deeper, hearing the walls turning and crashing behind him, breaking into nothing as he heard the thing's voice calling to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cCender\u2026\u201d it murmured, in a voice that somehow echoed and surrounded him.</p>\n<p>Starel\u2019s Tomb was huge, infinitely long, and full of twists and turns. He was given short moments of joy when he thought he'd escaped, followed by deep moments of fear and sorrow as he realized he did not. Who knows how long Cender fled the beast? Only that it was not long enough in his mind.</p>\n<p>He ran and ran and finally\u2026 fell, turning and looking at the beast, its great maw opening and splitting into four parts, its terrible teeth easily pushing into his skin and through it. He screamed loudly as Sikayt And Cender screamed and screamed, but the gods wouldn\u2019t hear him. And there he died, learning too late that the blessing of one god is the curse of another.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The old man\u2019s yellow, toothy grin looked also as terrifying as the story had sounded, and the children quickly fled while the old man laughed loudly, slapping his knees and coughing as his laughing fit caught up to him. He turned to leave, until a small voice caught him.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut what was it Cender found?\u201d it asked.</p>\n<p>The storyteller turned, looking at the small, deeply tanned boy, no older than twelve. \u201cWhat did he find?\u201d the man asked. \u201cWhy\u2026 he found just what he thought he found. The Home Ceitu. The City of the Gods. Starel\u2019s Tomb.\u201d</p>\n<p>The little boy shifted on his feet some, licking his cracked lips. \u201cSo\u2026 was he blessed?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>The old man\u2019s smile stretched across his face again. \u201cOf course not,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cHe was cursed. There are some secrets no one should have to discover.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut,\u201d the little boy continued, \u201cHe found the Home Ceitu. Isn\u2019t that a blessing?\u201d</p>\n<p>The old man\u2019s eyes narrowed at the boy as he realized that the child would not be swayed. \u201cWhat is your name, boy?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>The boy narrowed his eyes just for a moment. \u201cNever tell your name to one who hides his,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>The ancient man laughed loudly. \u201cWise boy\u2026 Follower of York, are we?\u201d he asked, then smiled and nodded at his own question. \u201cI am called Benadam,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>The boy nodded. \u201cMy friends call me Rone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell met, Rone. Come. Let me tell you a tale of York\u2026 Have you ever heard the story of the ape god Abirt and the waters of life?\u201d he asked, turning about and walking, the boy following him quickly and hanging onto every word.</p>\n</div></body></html>", "raw_source": "\n\t[[>]]\n\n[[module Rate]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\nCender was blessed of Old Aggie.\u00a0\u00a0His seven daughters and twenty-one granddaughters were proof of that.\u00a0\u00a0But now, standing before the statue of the goddess, he couldn\u2019t help but tremble inwardly.\u00a0\u00a0He was, after all, going to his death.\n\n\n\nCender pushed a long lock of thin, gray hair back on his head, washing his genitals in the pool of water at the statue\u2019s base, and turned, kissing his fingers and pressing them to the statue\u2019s lips, begging forgiveness for sins against his family and protection for the road ahead, knowing that only one of those prayers would be answered.\u00a0\u00a0The stone had fallen to him, after all.\n\n\n\nCender bowed his head in a final supplication and stepped out of the water, turning and walking into the white sands that surrounded the short, squat building.\u00a0\u00a0He wrapped a length of cloth about his head and took out the round, smooth pebble that had decided his fate.\u00a0\u00a0He cast it into the air, letting it fall to the earth, then kneeling to look at it carefully, squinting at the arrow carved into it.\u00a0\u00a0He picked it up again, shouldering the supply of water that would not last him more than a week, and walked into the desert, following it.\n\n-----\n\nWhen he came upon the ruins of the first homes\u2014those oldest ones which were now abandoned\u2014he rested.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He should have known better, especially since the ghosts of the dead are always close in the desert, but he didn\u2019t care.\u00a0\u00a0He was tired, his feet were blistered, and night had been upon him for hours.\u00a0\u00a0And he felt lonely.\u00a0\u00a0Cender had slept beside his wife for thirty-eight years, and now, he felt naked and cold without her warmth.\u00a0\u00a0He closed his eyes, trying not to listen to the voices in his head, when he heard a different one entirely. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou are old, Cender of Dnoma.

This was real.\n\n\n\nHe walked toward the large, opened doors and stepped into them, smiling, not even noticing the deep cuts in the floor or the lingering smell of sulfur. \n\n\n\nHe walked into the building, feeling his spirit lift as he gazed up at the seemingly endless ceilings, the deep corridors off either side of it, the endlessly twisting room.\u00a0\u00a0He walked down it, choosing a door at random and marking the entrance with his stone, then entering it.\u00a0\u00a0He explored, finding the works of the gods littered and skewed about the room, laying broken and destroyed.\u00a0\u00a0He sighed, turning to leave as he realized the true treasures would be far deeper in the city.\u00a0\u00a0As he turned to leave it, he bent to pick up his rock, and found it missing.\u00a0\u00a0His eyes narrowed at the floor, looking for it, realizing that he\u2019d foolishly discarded his mark of office and purpose\u2026 And then he heard it.\n\n\n\nIt was a roar, but unlike any he had ever heard.\u00a0\u00a0A sound worse than those the demons made when they were butchered.\u00a0\u00a0And it was quite close, he feared.\u00a0\u00a0So, he did what every coward who knows he is going to die does.\u00a0\u00a0He ran.\n\n\n\nCender\u2019s legs were old and tired, but the desert makes strong folk, and he could run.\u00a0\u00a0The doors were gone, gone to wherever the ancients send such things as displease them, and Cender instead ran for a different path, hoping that somehow he would be given exit, that the gods would forgive him, even though he knew that they would not.\u00a0\u00a0He hurried and ran, deeper and deeper, hearing the walls turning and crashing behind him, breaking into nothing as he heard the thing's voice calling to him.\n\n\n\n\u201cCender\u2026\u201d it murmured, in a voice that somehow echoed and surrounded him.\n\n\n\nStarel\u2019s Tomb was huge, infinitely long, and full of twists and turns. He was given short moments of joy when he thought he'd escaped, followed by deep moments of fear and sorrow as he realized he did not. Who knows how long Cender fled the beast? Only that it was not long enough in his mind.\n\n\n\nHe ran and ran and finally\u2026 fell, turning and looking at the beast, its great maw opening and splitting into four parts, its terrible teeth easily pushing into his skin and through it. He screamed loudly as Sikayt And Cender screamed and screamed, but the gods wouldn\u2019t hear him.\u00a0\u00a0And there he died, learning too late that the blessing of one god is the curse of another.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nThe old man\u2019s yellow, toothy grin looked also as terrifying as the story had sounded, and the children quickly fled while the old man laughed loudly, slapping his knees and coughing as his laughing fit caught up to him.\u00a0\u00a0He turned to leave, until a small voice caught him. \n\n\n\n\u201cBut what was it Cender found?\u201d it asked.\n\n\n\nThe storyteller turned, looking at the small, deeply tanned boy, no older than twelve.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat did he find?\u201d the man asked. \u201cWhy\u2026 he found just what he thought he found.\u00a0\u00a0The Home Ceitu. The City of the Gods.\u00a0\u00a0Starel\u2019s Tomb.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe little boy shifted on his feet some, licking his cracked lips.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSo\u2026 was he blessed?\u201d he asked.\n\n\n\nThe old man\u2019s smile stretched across his face again. \u201cOf course not,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cHe was cursed.\u00a0\u00a0There are some secrets no one should have to discover.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d the little boy continued, \u201cHe found the Home Ceitu. Isn\u2019t that a blessing?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe old man\u2019s eyes narrowed at the boy as he realized that the child would not be swayed.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat is your name, boy?\u201d he asked.\n\n\n\nThe boy narrowed his eyes just for a moment. \u201cNever tell your name to one who hides his,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nThe ancient man laughed loudly. \u201cWise boy\u2026 Follower of York, are we?\u201d he asked, then smiled and nodded at his own question. \u201cI am called Benadam,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nThe boy nodded. \u201cMy friends call me Rone.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWell met, Rone. Come. Let me tell you a tale of York\u2026 Have you ever heard the story of the ape god Abirt and the waters of life?\u201d he asked, turning about and walking, the boy following him quickly and hanging onto every word.\n", "references": [], "tags": ["bellerverse", "tale"], "title": "The Seeker - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/wonder", "year": 2011}, "worst-case-scenario": {"created_at": "2011-07-30T00:13:00", "creator": "GWBBQ", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "GWBBQ", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/gwbbq", "comment": "", "date": "2011-07-30T00:13:00"}, {"author": "TroyL", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/troyl", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

Nine seconds.\u201d A pause. \u201cFive seconds.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich way did you say it is?\u201d Matthew asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you have to keep asking?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat else am I supposed to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you checked your gun?\u201d</p>\n<p>Matthew gripped the MP7 tight. \u201cI did that an hour ago. And half an hour ago. And ten minutes ago. I have ten bullets, and I\u2019d like to stop thinking about that. I haven\u2019t eaten in two days, and I don\u2019t know what day it was then. Don\u2019t wanna think about those either. Which way is the building you saw?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zeke\u2019s face scrunched up. \u201cUm\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was Friday. This is Sunday, so that was Friday.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cZeke\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust follow me when the time comes. I know where it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>Matthew sighed. \u201cHow long we got?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zeke lifted his head up. \u201cCan\u2019t you hear? It\u2019s started.\u201d</p>\n<p>Matthew listened. From this close to Braunschweig, he could always hear the screaming. Usually the victims, the hunted. Sometimes the Embracers. It didn\u2019t matter. Twenty-three hours a day, always screaming. Screaming until there wasn\u2019t anyone left to scream. Twenty-three hours a day. One hour a day\u2026</p>\n<p>The Embracers were quiet because of their ritual. Matthew figured the rest were just tired of all the noise.</p>\n<p>The Hour had come. Matthew and Zeke rose from their hole. As usual, Zeke led, and Matthew followed.</p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you at least say how far away it was?\u201d Matthew asked. \u201cIt\u2019s been twenty minutes. If we need to turn around\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Zeke said. \u201cLook, I know you don\u2019t have training, and it wouldn\u2019t matter if you did, not now, but that\u2019s not the point. It\u2019s\u2026\u201d Zeke thought. Matthew always thought of Sarah Palin, a lifetime and a hemisphere ago, whenever Zeke thought really hard about something, because he always looked like it took a lot more effort than it should have.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s principle,\u201d Zeke finally said. \u201cYou don\u2019t turn around. Not after this. Either we find more food, maybe a way west, a way back to the States, or we die. No option three.\u201d Zeke huffed with finality.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Matthew said. \u201cHow far?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTen minutes, fifteen tops. No more.\u201d</p>\n<p>They kept walking in silence. Matthew was often silent around Zeke during their \u201cmissions.\u201d Anything he said would just make Zeke mad. Zeke never wanted to hear that Matthew had \u201cgiven up hope,\u201d as he put it; had given up hope of rescue, had given up hope well before they had even met. Zeke didn\u2019t want to hear that the Embracers were almost certainly back home, and in Brazil, and Africa, and China, and probably fucking Antarctica, if there was someone left there who wasn\u2019t one of them. Everywhere.</p>\n<p>Zeke went on because he dreamt of being at home, maybe on the cover of Time, famous. \u201cThe Man who Survived Europe,\u201d front cover. Maybe next to the story about how the war was over, and we had won. Matthew kept going because he was too stupid to die already.</p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>Zeke\u2019s sense of timing was spot on, for once. They reached the little concrete bunker thirty-five minutes after they left. Zeke\u2019s NATO training (\u201cbrainwashing,\u201d Matthew had called it, back when it had only saved his life once or twice) kicked in, and Matthew went to open the door for him. Zeke went in point, AR-15 and six rounds leading the way. They cleared the first couple of rooms the same way. All bedrooms, bare-bones, beds and desks, double occupancy. All empty.

Nine seconds.\u201d A pause. \u201cFive seconds.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhich way did you say it is?\u201d Matthew asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cDo you have to keep asking?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat else am I supposed to do?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHave you checked your gun?\u201d\n\n\n\nMatthew gripped the MP7 tight. \u201cI did that an hour ago. And half an hour ago. And ten minutes ago. I have ten bullets, and I\u2019d like to stop thinking about that. I haven\u2019t eaten in two days, and I don\u2019t know what day it was then. Don\u2019t wanna think about those either. Which way is the building you saw?\u201d\n\n\n\nZeke\u2019s face scrunched up. \u201cUm\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was Friday. This is Sunday, so that was Friday.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cZeke\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cJust follow me when the time comes. I know where it is.\u201d\n\n\n\nMatthew sighed. \u201cHow long we got?\u201d\n\n\n\nZeke lifted his head up. \u201cCan\u2019t you hear? It\u2019s started.\u201d\n\n\n\nMatthew listened. From this close to Braunschweig, he could always hear the screaming. Usually the victims, the hunted. Sometimes the Embracers. It didn\u2019t matter. Twenty-three hours a day, always screaming. Screaming until there wasn\u2019t anyone left to scream. Twenty-three hours a day. One hour a day\u2026\n\n\n\nThe Embracers were quiet because of their ritual. Matthew figured the rest were just tired of all the noise.\n\n\n\nThe Hour had come. Matthew and Zeke rose from their hole. As usual, Zeke led, and Matthew followed.\n\n\n\n**\n\n\n\n\u201cCan you at least say how far away it was?\u201d Matthew asked. \u201cIt\u2019s been twenty minutes. If we need to turn around\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Zeke said. \u201cLook, I know you don\u2019t have training, and it wouldn\u2019t matter if you did, not now, but that\u2019s not the point. It\u2019s\u2026\u201d Zeke thought. Matthew always thought of Sarah Palin, a lifetime and a hemisphere ago, whenever Zeke thought really hard about something, because he always looked like it took a lot more effort than it should have.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s principle,\u201d Zeke finally said. \u201cYou don\u2019t turn around. Not after this. Either we find more food, maybe a way west, a way back to the States, or we die. No option three.\u201d Zeke huffed with finality.\n\n\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Matthew said. \u201cHow far?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cTen minutes, fifteen tops. No more.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey kept walking in silence. Matthew was often silent around Zeke during their \u201cmissions.\u201d Anything he said would just make Zeke mad. Zeke never wanted to hear that Matthew had \u201cgiven up hope,\u201d as he put it; had given up hope of rescue, had given up hope well before they had even met. Zeke didn\u2019t want to hear that the Embracers were almost certainly back home, and in Brazil, and Africa, and China, and probably fucking Antarctica, if there was someone left there who wasn\u2019t one of them. Everywhere. \n\n\n\nZeke went on because he dreamt of being at home, maybe on the cover of Time, famous. \u201cThe Man who Survived Europe,\u201d front cover. Maybe next to the story about how the war was over, and we had won. Matthew kept going because he was too stupid to die already.\n\n\n\n**\n\n\n\nZeke\u2019s sense of timing was spot on, for once. They reached the little concrete bunker thirty-five minutes after they left. Zeke\u2019s NATO training (\u201cbrainwashing,\u201d Matthew had called it, back when it had only saved his life once or twice) kicked in, and Matthew went to open the door for him. Zeke went in point, AR-15 and six rounds leading the way. They cleared the first couple of rooms the same way. All bedrooms, bare-bones, beds and desks, double occupancy. All empty. The mess was like the others they had seen, refrigerator full of spoiled food, pantry full of half-edible canned food. Maybe a week\u2019s-worth, maybe ten days. They could carry six. A good day\u2019s work.\n\n\n\nMatthew wanted to get some sleep, but Zeke was sure he heard something. Not Embracers; their ritual wasn\u2019t quite over yet. Something else, and something in the bunker. There was one room left.\n\n\n\nMatthew was glad Zeke\u2019s boot was in such good shape, a credit to the young sergeant major this pair had come from.
