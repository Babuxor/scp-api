The reforms to the Foundation\u2019s classification system are long overdue and they have expanded our ability to describe the features of an anomaly, but this has come at the cost of both easy reference and linguistic cohesion. ACS terms on the whole have only partial thematic unity or contextual indication of their meaning, as if they are two incomplete systems merged together. This itself is an issue, but it masks a greater flaw underneath.</p>\n<p>The true problem we are facing is not that the current ACS format is too complex - it is that it is not complex enough! We are still capable, on an institutional level, of understanding our own documentation and I will not stand for this miscarriage of justice! In the nearly 30 years I have been part of the Foundation, we have taken only timid, half-measure steps towards our great destiny of total incomprehensibility. I say this cowardice has gone on long enough! Long enough and no longer!</p>\n<p>And so to address this crippling flaw in our organization, I propose the following: in order to sever the last remaining ties of ACS to functionality, we must cut it entirely from the English language and its purse of stolen words. We must engineer a language wholly focused on condensing the granularity of ACS information into the most informationally-dense and functionally-useless form possible.</p>\n<p>My proposal for a Revised ACS will encode the exact specifications of an anomaly\u2019s qualities and distinctive features in its morphology, providing granular detail that will be rendered utterly incoherent if it is mispronounced, misheard, mistyped, spoken with any sort of accent, subjected to ordinary sound changes, or otherwise changed in any way.</p>\n<p>This proposal owes a great debt to Mr. John Quijada\u2019s Ithkuil, and I offer Mr. Quijada my sincerest apologies for this inexpert bungling of his magnum opus. It is only fitting, for the purposes of destroying language\u2019s function and purpose, that I fill the role of demiurge and create a lesser world of base matter in crude imitation of the truth.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<h3 id=\"toc0\"><span>Phonology</span></h3>\n<p>I have chosen to keep the phonology and romanization of RACS within the boundaries of what is easily pronounced by English speakers and what can be easily typed on a standard keyboard, except in those cases where I have not.</p>\n<div class=\"mobile\">\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th colspan=\"9\">Consonants</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>LAB</th>\n<th>DEN</th>\n<th>ALV</th>\n<th>POA</th>\n<th>PAL</th>\n<th>VEL</th>\n<th>UVU</th>\n<th>GLO</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">NSL</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">m</td>\n<td></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">n</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\u014b</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">STP</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">p / b</td>\n<td></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">t / d</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">k / g</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">q</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\u0294</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">EJS</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">p'</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">t'</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">k'</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">AFF</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">t\u0361s / d\u0361z</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">t\u0361\u0283 / d\u0361\u0292</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">q\u0361\u03c7</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">EJA</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">t\u0361s'</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">FRC</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">f / v</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\u03b8 / \u00f0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">s / z</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\u0283 / \u0292</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">x / \u0263</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">APX</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">j</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">TRL</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\u0299</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">r</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">LAT</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">l</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">LAF</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">t\u0361\u026c</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">CLK</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">\u014b!</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>While &lt;r&gt;

The reforms to the Foundation\u2019s classification system are long overdue and they have expanded our ability to describe the features of an anomaly, but this has come at the cost of both easy reference and linguistic cohesion. ACS terms on the whole have only partial thematic unity or contextual indication of their meaning, as if they are two incomplete systems merged together. This itself is an issue, but it masks a greater flaw underneath.\n\n\n\nThe true problem we are facing is not that the current ACS format is too complex - it is that it is not complex enough! We are still capable, on an institutional level, of understanding our own documentation and I will not stand for this miscarriage of justice! In the nearly 30 years I have been part of the Foundation, we have taken only timid, half-measure steps towards our great destiny of total incomprehensibility. I say this cowardice has gone on long enough! Long enough and\u00a0\u00a0no longer!\n\n\n\nAnd so to address this crippling flaw in our organization, I propose the following: in order to sever the last remaining ties of ACS to functionality, we must cut it entirely from the English language and its purse of stolen words. We must engineer a language wholly focused on condensing the granularity of ACS information into the most informationally-dense and functionally-useless form possible.\n\n\n\nMy proposal for a Revised ACS will encode the exact specifications of an anomaly\u2019s qualities and distinctive features in its morphology, providing granular detail that will be rendered utterly incoherent if it is mispronounced, misheard, mistyped, spoken with any sort of accent, subjected to ordinary sound changes,\u00a0\u00a0or otherwise changed in any way.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nThis proposal owes a great debt to Mr. John Quijada\u2019s Ithkuil, and I offer Mr. Quijada my sincerest apologies for this inexpert bungling of his magnum opus. It is only fitting, for the purposes of destroying language\u2019s function and purpose, that I fill the role of demiurge and create a lesser world of base matter in crude imitation of the truth.\n\n@@ @@\n\n+++ Phonology\n\nI have chosen to keep the phonology and romanization of RACS within the boundaries of what is easily pronounced by English speakers and what can be easily typed on a standard keyboard, except in those cases where I have not.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"mobile\"]]\n\n||||||||||||||||||~ Consonants ||\n\n||~ ||~ LAB ||~ DEN ||~ ALV ||~ POA ||~ PAL ||~ VEL ||~ UVU ||~ GLO ||\n\n||= NSL ||= m || ||= n || || ||= \u014b || || ||\n\n||= STP ||= p / b || ||= t / d || || ||= k / g ||= q ||= \u0294 ||\n\n||= EJS ||= p' ||= ||= t' ||= ||= ||= k' ||= ||= ||\n\n||= AFF ||= ||= ||= t\u0361s / d\u0361z ||= t\u0361\u0283 / d\u0361\u0292\u00a0\u00a0||= ||= ||= q\u0361\u03c7 ||= ||\n\n||= EJA ||= ||= ||= t\u0361s' ||= ||= ||= ||= ||= ||\n\n||= FRC ||= f / v ||= \u03b8 / \u00f0 ||= s / z ||= \u0283 / \u0292 ||= ||= x / \u0263 ||= ||= ||\n\n||= APX ||= ||= ||= ||= ||= j ||= ||= ||= ||\n\n||= TRL ||= \u0299 ||= ||= r ||= ||= ||= ||= ||= ||\n\n||= LAT ||= ||= ||= l ||= ||= ||= ||= ||= ||\n\n||= LAF ||= ||= ||= t\u0361\u026c ||= ||= ||= ||= ||= ||\n\n||= CLK ||= ||= ||= \u014b! ||= ||= ||= ||= ||= ||\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nWhile <r> is written here as the trilled /r/, but it is more appropriately described as a \"whatever rhotic\" and can be realized as /\u027e/, /\u0279/, /\u0280/, or any other variety as one sees fit.\n\n\n\n||||||||~ Vowels ||\n\n|| || Front || Central || Back ||\n\n|| Upper ||= i\u00a0\u00a0||= \u0268 ||= u\u00a0\u00a0||\n\n|| High Mid ||= e\u00a0\u00a0||\u00a0\u00a0||= o\u00a0\u00a0||\n\n|| Mid\u00a0\u00a0||\u00a0\u00a0||= \u0259\u0303\u00a0\u00a0||\u00a0\u00a0||\n\n|| Low Mid ||= \u025b\u00a0\u00a0||\u00a0\u00a0||= \u0254\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0||\n\n|| Low ||||||= a\u00a0\u00a0||||\n\n\n\nThe vowel inventory has been arranged so that, if you are more in line with the spirit of the IPA chart rather than the reality, they will be arranged in such a way to mimic the Foundation\u2019s own sigil.\n\n@@ @@\n\n+++ Romanization\n\n\n\nRevised ACS uses multiple romanization systems: sets A and B (With and without diacritics, respectively) are acceptable for casual usage and teaching materials, but not in keeping with the standards set forth by the Classification Committee.

It seems like it was always some port city these days. Tuy H\u00f2a two months back, Montevideo was in the early spring. Acapulco before that, on New Year\u2019s Eve. Acapulco was the last case, a supplier for Marshall, Carter, and Dark holding a high price auction at a resort. I took down my targets there, and Agent R\u00fanda brought back several items of interest to her organization. A rare example of a quick and easy success in my field.</p>\n<p>These last few had been far less fruitful. I had a few leads. Anomalous weapons. Highly organized. Access to helicopters and gunboats. Led by a graying, chain smoking American man with a thick Philadelphian accent, judging by the extra \u201cr\u201d he puts in the word water. And a name for the group: Movers and Shakers. They raided a slew of government buildings and robbed the Central Bank of Uruguay in Montevideo. They blew up a few cargo vessels in Tuy H\u00f2a and stole artifacts from an ancient temple.</p>\n<p>Now Calabar. They shot down a private jet, and raided a hotel, capturing a few important government figures and business leaders, all of whom just so happen to be embedded agents of other secret organizations according to our intelligence. GOC, SCP, even one of our own. Oh, and the private jet? An employee of the elusive Anderson Robotics, if you\u2019d believe him. Willing to sell out company secrets, for the right price. Whatever secrets he had, the chance to learn them died with him, screaming as the plane fell to the ground. We ruled out Valravn early, part of what was stolen in Uruguay was money from their payroll and our contacts said that the Movers and Shakers were new players in the game. Motive unknown. Descriptions and reported accents are all over the place but most speak English and some witnesses report a smattering of other languages. My thoughts: this is a multinational group, whoever they are.</p>\n<p>The boys and girls at HQ are convinced this is just a cover for the Chaos Insurgency. I\u2019m not quite sold on that. This is the wrong kind of mess. Chaos Insurgency comes in two flavors. The first is silent, precise, and the only people who know they were even there are too dead to tell the tale. The second flavor leaves a trail of bodies, untraceable ammo, busted computers and cameras, and they usually scorch the building afterwards. Either way, they try to leave no witnesses. Everything we got on these guys comes from witness testimony.</p>\n<p>Headquarters is a mess right now. A brief and nasty internal power struggle shook my office. Classic mismanagement here at the International Anomalies Network. It\u2019s a wonder Five Eyes gives us any funding at all. Normally the dysfunction doesn\u2019t bother me, but my new direct superior and I have a\u2026 complicated history. Marcus Pott, an old schoolmate of mine. He\u2019s never really forgiven me for something he walked in on back when we were both in university, over the summer. I\u2019ll spare you the details but it involved his sister and a hamburger, and apparently it doesn\u2019t matter to him that the entire thing was her idea and that neither of us knew he\u2019d be back that day. He\u2019s carried that grudge for over a decade now, it was less of a problem when we worked at separate offices\u2026 and since his sister got her own place.</p>\n<p>Heh, office drama. The case is going so poorly I have time to think about office drama. My hotel isn\u2019t far from the airport, and I have a confirmed witness at a bar just a block away. Apparently he talked to the head honcho the night before. This is the best lead I have, but it ain\u2019t much. The bar is popular with tourists, and \u201colder man with a noticeable American accent\u201d can easily be a red herring in these parts. Easy enough to write the report though. Good paperwork keeps you employed.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>The bar is a little slow when I get there. It\u2019s only 2 PM after all. Blue and green lights and the shine of TV screens are the only lighting. Flowers hang from the ceiling as a form of decoration. Quietly in the background a playlist is cycling through the greatest hits of 2004. At least this will be quick, my contact is tending bar right now.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Adegoke?\u201d I say, sitting in front of him. He\u2019s a tall man, well trimmed facial hair. Dressed up to the nines, even if that\u2019s a little much for this bar</p>\n<p>He pours a glass of water in front of me. \u201cYes. You are the investigator I\u2019m waiting on. Your name is?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCooke. John Cooke.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I get you something to drink, Mr. Cooke?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLong Island Iced Tea, if you can.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>He begins to mix the drink.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, Mr. Cooke, I assume you want to hear everything I know about the terrorist.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, the suspect.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>A man walks up from a table to the bar, interrupting.</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me mister bartender, can I get another one of this cider?\u201d</p>\n<p>The bartender nods and pours him the drink. The man tosses him 1000 Naira, glaring at me as he does it.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was American. Older. Little chubby but with muscles. Tattoos on his arms. Lots of them. Fire, skulls, dice. Things like that. Gray hair, a little balding. Sunglasses. Was smoking the whole time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSounds familiar. What did he say?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe drank some water. Said he was a security consultant. He warned me that things might get rowdy around the airport. I asked if he was protecting someone. If they were important, controversial. He said no, well he said the man was controversial and some people thought he was important, but he was definitely not protecting him. Then he laughed and ordered a drink.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did he order?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe called it a Paper Plane. I never made one before. Equal parts, not that hard to make, although I had to scour to find the amaro for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, an American drink. I think it's originally from a bar in Chicago.\u201d</p>\n<p>A voice chimes out behind me.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Violet Hour.\u201d</p>\n<p>It is the man who interrupted us before. Now wearing sunglasses and chuckling.</p>\n<p>I turn back to the bartender.</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me.\u201d</p>\n<p>I walk towards the stranger.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou seem to be quite fond of eavesdropping.\u201d</p>\n<p>The stranger laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was just hoping to hear what he had to say about my boss.\u201d</p>\n<p>I walk right up to him, face to face.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have said that, you know now that I have to take you in for questioning.\u201d</p>\n<p>He laughs again.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d</p>\n<p>I raise an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot true?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to bring me in. You have to try.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suddenly a bottle of cider smashes on my head and I receive a knee to the gut.</p>\n<p>He takes off on foot. I draw my gun.</p>\n<p>By the time I make it out the door, he\u2019s already on a dirt bike and speeding away. I take two shots. One misses, but one seems to glance his shoulder. I see another bike parked. I start my pursuit.</p>\n<p>Past the airport, planes landing overhead. A hard right out of a roundabout. Through a densely packed neighborhood, busy streets with all sorts of little businesses under tents on the sidewalks. People are running away and shouting as we speed through. Into heavier traffic, and out toward the greenery, leafy plants are dense on both sides of the road. Nowhere to go but straight ahead.</p>\n<p>The bridge. Sparsely used at the moment, in the midst of repairs but no workers in sight. I have my shot.</p>\n<p>It connects, and he goes spilling off of his bike. He slides across the pavement for several seconds. Bone is protruding from both of his legs.</p>\n<p>My shot hit him in the lower back, about an inch left of his spine. He\u2019s probably not making it out of this alive.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s still chuckling as I walk up to him. He reaches into his coat pocket. I point my gun at him as he throws his other hand up.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was told\u2026 if you caught me\u2026 to\u2026 give you this.\u201d</p>\n<p>An envelope, now with blood splattered on it. I reach out with my other hand. Grab it, and tear it open.</p>\n<p><em>Hello Mr. Cooke,</em></p>\n<p><em>It has come to my attention that you have been assigned to investigate my team\u2019s operations.

It seems like it was always some port city these days. Tuy H\u00f2a two months back, Montevideo was in the early spring. Acapulco before that, on New Year\u2019s Eve. Acapulco was the last case, a supplier for Marshall, Carter, and Dark holding a high price auction at a resort. I took down my targets there, and Agent R\u00fanda brought back several items of interest to her organization. A rare example of a quick and easy success in my field. \n\n\n\nThese last few had been far less fruitful. I had a few leads. Anomalous weapons. Highly organized. Access to helicopters and gunboats. Led by a graying, chain smoking American man with a thick Philadelphian accent, judging by the extra \u201cr\u201d he puts in the word water. And a name for the group: Movers and Shakers. They raided a slew of government buildings and robbed the Central Bank of Uruguay in Montevideo. They blew up a few cargo vessels in Tuy H\u00f2a and stole artifacts from an ancient temple. \n\n\n\nNow Calabar. They shot down a private jet, and raided a hotel, capturing a few important government figures and business leaders, all of whom just so happen to be embedded agents of other secret organizations according to our intelligence. GOC, SCP, even one of our own. Oh, and the private jet? An employee of the elusive Anderson Robotics, if you\u2019d believe him. Willing to sell out company secrets, for the right price. Whatever secrets he had, the chance to learn them died with him, screaming as the plane fell to the ground. We ruled out Valravn early, part of what was stolen in Uruguay was money from their payroll and our contacts said that the Movers and Shakers were new players in the game. Motive unknown. Descriptions and reported accents are all over the place but most speak English and some witnesses report a smattering of other languages. My thoughts: this is a multinational group, whoever they are. \n\n\n\nThe boys and girls at HQ are convinced this is just a cover for the Chaos Insurgency. I\u2019m not quite sold on that. This is the wrong kind of mess. Chaos Insurgency comes in two flavors. The first is silent, precise, and the only people who know they were even there are too dead to tell the tale. The second flavor leaves a trail of bodies, untraceable ammo, busted computers and cameras, and they usually scorch the building afterwards. Either way, they try to leave no witnesses. Everything we got on these guys comes from witness testimony. \n\n\n\nHeadquarters is a mess right now. A brief and nasty internal power struggle shook my office. Classic mismanagement here at the International Anomalies Network. It\u2019s a wonder Five Eyes gives us any funding at all. Normally the dysfunction doesn\u2019t bother me, but my new direct superior and I have a\u2026 complicated history. Marcus Pott, an old schoolmate of mine. He\u2019s never really forgiven me for something he walked in on back when we were both in university, over the summer. I\u2019ll spare you the details but it involved his sister and a hamburger, and apparently it doesn\u2019t matter to him that the entire thing was her idea and that neither of us knew he\u2019d be back that day.\u00a0\u00a0He\u2019s carried that grudge for over a decade now, it was less of a problem when we worked at separate offices\u2026 and since his sister got her own place. \n\n\n\nHeh, office drama. The case is going so poorly I have time to think about office drama. My hotel isn\u2019t far from the airport, and I have a confirmed witness at a bar just a block away. Apparently he talked to the head honcho the night before. This is the best lead I have, but it ain\u2019t much. The bar is popular with tourists, and \u201colder man with a noticeable American accent\u201d can easily be a red herring in these parts. Easy enough to write the report though. Good paperwork keeps you employed.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n~~~\n\n\n\nThe bar is a little slow when I get there. It\u2019s only 2 PM after all. Blue and green lights and the shine of TV screens are the only lighting. Flowers hang from the ceiling as a form of decoration. Quietly in the background a playlist is cycling through the greatest hits of 2004. At least this will be quick, my contact is tending bar right now. \n\n\n\n\u201cMr. Adegoke?\u201d I say, sitting in front of him. He\u2019s a tall man, well trimmed facial hair. Dressed up to the nines, even if that\u2019s a little much for this bar\n\n\n\nHe pours a glass of water in front of me. \u201cYes. You are the investigator I\u2019m waiting on. Your name is?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cCooke. John Cooke.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cCan I get you something to drink, Mr. Cooke?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cLong Island Iced Tea, if you can.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe begins to mix the drink. \n\n\n\n\u201cWell, Mr. Cooke, I assume you want to hear everything I know about the terrorist.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, the suspect.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nA man walks up from a table to the bar, interrupting.\n\n\n\n\u201cExcuse me mister bartender, can I get another one of this cider?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe bartender nods and pours him the drink. The man tosses him 1000 Naira, glaring at me as he does it.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe was American. Older. Little chubby but with muscles. Tattoos on his arms. Lots of them. Fire, skulls, dice. Things like that. Gray hair, a little balding. Sunglasses. Was smoking the whole time.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSounds familiar. What did he say?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHe drank some water. Said he was a security consultant. He warned me that things might get rowdy around the airport. I asked if he was protecting someone. If they were important, controversial. He said no, well he said the man was controversial and some people thought he was important, but he was definitely not protecting him. Then he laughed and ordered a drink.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat did he order?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHe called it a Paper Plane. I never made one before. Equal parts, not that hard to make, although I had to scour to find the amaro for it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh, an American drink. I think it's originally from a bar in Chicago.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nA voice chimes out behind me.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Violet Hour.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt is the man who interrupted us before. Now wearing sunglasses and chuckling. \n\n\n\nI turn back to the bartender.\n\n\n\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d\n\n\n\nI walk towards the stranger.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou seem to be quite fond of eavesdropping.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe stranger laughs.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was just hoping to hear what he had to say about my boss.\u201d\n\n\n\nI walk right up to him, face to face.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have said that, you know now that I have to take you in for questioning.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe laughs again.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\n\n\nI raise an eyebrow.\n\n\n\n\u201cNot true?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to bring me in. You have to try.\u201d\n\n\n\nSuddenly a bottle of cider smashes on my head and I receive a knee to the gut. \n\n\n\nHe takes off on foot. I draw my gun. \n\n\n\nBy the time I make it out the door, he\u2019s already on a dirt bike and speeding away. I take two shots. One misses, but one seems to glance his shoulder. I see another bike parked. I start my pursuit. \n\n\n\nPast the airport, planes landing overhead. A hard right out of a roundabout. Through a densely\u00a0\u00a0packed neighborhood, busy streets with all sorts of little businesses under tents on the sidewalks. People are running away and shouting as we speed through. Into heavier traffic, and out toward the greenery, leafy plants are dense on both sides of the road. Nowhere to go but straight ahead. \n\n\n\nThe bridge. Sparsely used at the moment, in the midst of repairs but no workers in sight. I have my shot. \n\n\n\nIt connects, and he goes spilling off of his bike. He slides across the pavement for several seconds. Bone is protruding from both of his legs. \n\n\n\nMy shot hit him in the lower back, about an inch left of his spine. He\u2019s probably not making it out of this alive. \n\n\n\nHe\u2019s still chuckling as I walk up to him. He reaches into his coat pocket. I point my gun at him as he throws his other hand up. \n\n\n\n\u201cI was told\u2026 if you caught me\u2026 to\u2026 give you this.\u201d\n\n\n\nAn envelope, now with blood splattered on it. I reach out with my other hand. Grab it, and tear it open.\n\n\n\n//Hello Mr. Cooke,//\n\n\n\n//It has come to my attention that you have been assigned to investigate my team\u2019s operations. I know you can\u2019t refuse a mission assigned to you, but I\u2019m not your usual headache. Some organizations will accept losses. Some agents will defect. Some will cut deals. So will quietly retire when there is pressure on them.//\n\n\n\n//I am not that man. My team and I are committed to our vision of the future and we\u2019re willing to kill and willing to die to get there. The passion we feel is greater than any check you can cut or any threat you can make.//\n\n\n\n//I know organizations like yours can be a mess of bureaucracy. You\u2019ll probably be sent after me no matter what, and showing this letter to your management probably will only make them more interested.//\n\n\n\n//The easiest thing to do will be to kill you, but if you are reading this letter I presume my confidence in my ability to accomplish that goal was somewhat misplaced.//\n\n\n\n//I extend to you an invitation. Meet me in Aruba, alone next Thursday. I\u2019ll do my best to dissuade you from pursuing us further. If you do not attend, attempts on your life will continue until I have reasonable confirmation of your death, disappearance, retirement, or resignation.//\n\n\n\n//See you soon,\n\nCommander Cloud//\n\n\n\nI\u2019m stunned, I think of reading it over in a frenzy. I\u2019ve never read anything like this. Who taunts someone? Who invites them to a tropical island? Who even bothers to handwrite a letter? \n\n\n\nAs all these thoughts hit me, I hear a shuffling noise. I move the letter down from my gaze to see the man bleeding out in front of me pulling his gun out of his pocket, finally getting it past his belt. As he raises his arm to aim, I have my gun pointed at him already.\n\n\n\nI take the shot. \n\n\n\n//bang//\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://snippets.wikidot.com/html5player\">:snippets:html5player</a>\n\n|type=audio\n\n|url= https://firedawnfolder.wdfiles.com/local--files/gerrymanderbassist/movers_and_shakers.mp3]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[image https://firedawnfolder.wdfiles.com/local--files/gerrymanderbassist/man%20of%20action.png]]\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Lyrics\"\u00a0\u00a0hide=\"- let's get to work\"]]\n\nHahahaha\u2026 \n\nAlright alright alright \n\nCalm down everyone\n\nWell he\u2019s here now\n\nMaybe we can trust him\n\nOnly one way to find out\n\nLet\u2019s let \u2018em in on our little secret\n\nHere we go\n\n\n\nHave you found yourself somewhere you don\u2019t belong?\n\nWhen the doubts hit your head do they hit you a bit too strong?\n\nHave you thought about how someone else would end up here?\n\nIs everything so incredibly unclear? \n\n\n\nAlright\n\nIf you are lost \n\nThen you are welcome\n\nThis is the kingdom\n\nThat we built up in the dark\n\n\n\nIf you are hopeless\n\nThen we can help you\n\nWe are your family\n\nNo matter what else you\u2019ve done\n\n\n\nStep into the kitchen smell what we are cooking\n\nIf you weren\u2019t looking before I bet you are now\n\nListen to the whispers, ain\u2019t ya heard the rumor\n\nThe world\u2019s just a house of cards we\u2019re gonna knock down\n\n\n\nBurn another bridge, leave another city\n\nBury your past, \u2018cause things are trending up now\n\nRaise a brand new flag, hoard a little treasure\n\nWe\u2019re the ones everybody got their eyes on\n\n\n\nAnd now you\u2019re back where you began\n\nSo listen to my simple plan\n\nWe\u2019ve got a scheme that just can\u2019t fail\n\nWe only have to break the veil\n\nThe joker is our only card\n\n\u2018Cause surfing chaos ain\u2019t too hard\n\nWe\u2019ll use a trick to win the fight\n\nAnd force our foes into the light\n\nIf you are poor\n\nWe\u2019ll make you wealthy\n\nGreed can be healthy\n\nIf you know your enemies well\n\n\n\nIf you are weak\n\nThere\u2019s strength in numbers\n\nA hero slumbers\n\nWe just have to wake him up now\n\n\n\nGather all the magic, hope for something tragic\n\nWe find silver linings on all the gray clouds we make\n\nJoin us in our trouble, rebuild from the rubble\n\nAll the best kings find their crown in the gutter\n\n\n\nSo does that sound good?\n\nThe team would love have you\n\nOh, don\u2019t worry\n\nWe\u2019re very confident\n\nSay goodbye boys\n\nHahahahahaha\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n", "references": [], "tags": ["action", "adventure", "audio", "chase", "first-person", "spy-fiction", "tale"], "title": "A Real Man Of Action - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/a-real-man-of-action", "year": 2024}, "a-talk-with-a-stranger-in-the-forest": {"created_at": "2024-02-22T22:51:00", "creator": "Mew-ltiverse", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Mew-ltiverse", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/mew-ltiverse", "comment": "", "date": "2024-02-22T22:51:00"}, {"author": "Mew-ltiverse", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/mew-ltiverse", "comment": "Added tags: bleak, creepypasta, first-person, surrealist-fiction.

I don\u2019t know how I got here. The last thing I remember, I was walking home from the store. Luckily, though, it\u2019s not too heavy. I figure that I must have taken a wrong turn somewhere. I already checked the GPS on my phone, but there\u2019s no signal.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t really get freaked out by getting lost. Every day is an adventure to me. Life has so much to offer, and is far too short to dwell on the negatives.</p>\n<p>I figure if I walk far enough, I\u2019ll stumble across some hikers, maybe some kids playing. As a child, I played in the woods near my house with my best friend. I chuckle. Oh, that one time I returned drenched because I fell in the river. My parents were <em>not</em> happy, but worried all the same. Moments like that are horrifying at the time, but important to me.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been pretty peaceful. The weather is overcast, but it isn\u2019t raining. Just enough so that I don\u2019t have to deal with the sun burning a hole through my retinas. As I walk, I hear the birds chirping, I feel the gentle breeze against my cheeks. I take a breath in, then breathe out with a soft smile on my face. It\u2019s been a bit since I\u2019ve had the time to just take things in like this, it\u2019s all been so hectic. Maybe life knew to just give me some time to myself like this.</p>\n<p>As I\u2019m walking, I notice something in the distance. It looks like some sort of building. I can\u2019t see it very well from here. Maybe it\u2019s a rest spot for hikers? I slowly but surely make my way to the building. The outside looks pretty rough. Ivy growing in between the wood, scratches and bites from different animals, moss coating most of the surface. The wood looks extremely weathered, like it has survived a thousand storms. Despite the worn look, there are no holes, no gaps in the wood. It doesn't look as if there are any windows, either. I begin to walk around the small building, looking for any sort of entrance, any sort of way to look inside. After a few minutes of searching, I realize that there is no door. No door and no windows.</p>\n<p>This strange building makes me feel odd, but I can\u2019t help but chuckle at the absurdity of this. For good measure, I run my hands over the wood again. Maybe there\u2019s a secret entrance? A spider crawls over my hand, causing me to jump. I take a deep breath, then laugh. It\u2019s just a spider. A spider on a weird building with no entrances. Despite my best efforts, I can\u2019t help but feel uneasy. I shake my head. Life is an adventure. I feel like things happen for a reason, and I found this place for a reason. What that reason was, I\u2019m unsure.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, I feel something touch my shoulder. I practically jump out of my skin, screaming. I quickly turn around to see who\u2014 or what\u2014 had just touched me.</p>\n<p>In front of me, is a tall man wearing a green hoodie. His hair is long and unkempt. He gives me a tired smile. His eyes are dull, as if they didn't belong to a living, breathing person. Despite the deathly look of his face, I could swear he's not much older than me.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d The man asks. His voice is low, yet a bit nasally at the same time.</p>\n<p>I take a good look at the man. There\u2019s blood on his hoodie.</p>\n<p>I pay no mind to it; at least, I try not to. I don\u2019t get scared easily. I try to speak, but I feel frozen in\u2014 fear? Is it fear? I can\u2019t tell. The longer I look at him, the more I notice. He looks exhausted, the bags under his eyes practically black. There are bandages wrapped around his thighs, over the red and brown stained grey jeans he's wearing. The bandages look as if they are attempting to hold something together. Something about him makes me feel\u2026 an emotion I can't pinpoint.</p>\n<p>The man lifts both of his arms. \u201cI can tell you\u2019re scared.\u201d He replies. I can tell that he is trying to soften his tone, like laying a thin carpet over a pile of dirt.</p>\n<p>I can\u2019t help but stare at the blood. It stained the chest area and sleeves. Some of it is dark brown, as if it has been there for a long time, while some of it is a brighter red. In fact, I can smell blood in the air. Whose was it? Is it his? An animal\u2019s? This is a foreign feeling to me. I\u2019m terrified. I feel frozen in place. Not a single part of me wants to move. Not even my eyes move, glued to this unnerving stranger.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh.\u201d The man replies simply, his expression telling me he realizes something. He gives me a sad smile, a smile with pain hidden deep within. I feel a pit in my chest just witnessing it.</p>\n<p>He removes his hoodie. Beneath is a white t-shirt stained in blood. His arms are adorned by bloodied bandages that have begun to rot into his skin, the fabric blending into his wrists. Bits of white pus peak out from beneath the bandages, mixing with the flesh and blood. He lifts up the shirt, the fabric of the shirt sticking to his skin, making a wet ripping sound. Bits of necrotic flesh stuck to the fabric as he lifted it. In place of where his heart should be, is an empty cavity. Beginning to rot away. Some of the flesh surrounding the area is hardened and black, with other parts around it puffy and red. He looks at me, then pulls the shirt back down, letting the hoodie fall back down as well.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe blood? It\u2019s mine. I\u2019ve been rotting for a long time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Horrifying doesn\u2019t even begin to describe what I just witnessed. The dreadful smell, the sound of hard flesh ripping away with fabric. It was all enough to make me lightheaded. My thoughts come to a stop. I can\u2019t articulate any of my feelings. Every time a thought comes into my head, its gone as fast as it enters.</p>\n<p>We stare at each other for what feels like ages. Finally, I gain the courage to speak.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d My voice shakes.</p>\n<p>The man shakes his head. \u201cI suppose that\u2019s not a very good first impression.\u201d He laughs sheepishly, sadness edging his tone. \u201cI uh, haven\u2019t talked to anyone in a while.\u201d</p>\n<p>I observe his expression. Despite his eyes showing no sign of life, I can see a hint of something deeper hidden within. I look at the ground, then back up at the man. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d I ask, the shakiness of my voice growing more apparent.</p>\n<p>The man shrugs, an unreadable look coming across his face. He's silent for a few moments. His eyes wander, staring out into the distance \u201cOnce upon a time, I got lost on my way home.\" He pauses. The wind blows strands of his long dark hair in his face. \"I\u2019ve been here ever since.\u201d His eyes trail back to me.</p>\n<p>I feel my blood go cold. I am lost. I figured if I walked far enough, I\u2019d find a way out. Is this it? Am I stuck here forever? I feel my chest tightening. My breath begins shaking. I still have so much to do. So much I want to accomplish. Did one stupid mistake really mean my life was over? I always try to find the best in things. If I knew that being so nonchalant would've caused me to end up here\u2014</p>\n<p>I feel his hand on my shoulder again.</p>\n<p>\u201cRelax.\u201d The man says to me in a calm tone. \u201cI was\u2026 lost in a different way from you. Don\u2019t jump to conclusions. There\u2019s still time for you. I\u2026 can tell this isn\u2019t like you. Don\u2019t let me dull your spirit. That positivity, that optimism.\u201d There's an expression on his face that I can't quite pinpoint.</p>\n<p>I flinch. \u201cH-How do you know that?\u201d I stutter, growing defensive. Just who is this? Is this man even human? No, he can\u2019t be. His body is literally rotting, yet here he is, speaking and breathing. Is he breathing? I didn't know that, actually. Is he even alive?</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you\u2019ve been around as long as I have, you become able to pick up on certain things.\u201d The man replies. He sighs, looking up at the sky. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna get dark soon. If you turn around and exit the way you came in, you\u2019ll find your way out.\u201d</p>\n<p>I tightly grip the bag I've been carrying, feeling the plastic against my fingers. \u201cI-I\u2019m not stuck here?\u201d I feel a lump in my throat. The idea that I\u2019d accidentally get myself stuck here because I was too naive to panic. I want nothing but to panic now. I want to scream. None of this made sense.</p>\n<p>We were both quiet for a moment.</p>\n<p>I look behind me. For the first time, I realize just how big the forest is. It\u2019s almost too big. And for the first time, I feel small. Like an ant in a movie theater.</p>\n<p>The man puts his hands together. \u201cYou\u2019re getting caught up. I know it seems scary. But if you dwell on your fears, you\u2019ll get stuck inside of them. Just turn around. Don\u2019t close your eyes.\u201d</p>\n<p>I firmly plant my feet against the ground, clenching my fists. \u201cI\u2014 I believe things happen for a reason!\u201d I exclaim. \u201cDo you think\u2026 that this happened for a reason?\u201d I ask, unable to mask the uncertainty in my voice.</p>\n<p>The man gives a sad laugh. I feel a chill run down my spine. I didn't know that a simple laugh could communicate so much emotion. \u201cMaybe for you. But for me, things don\u2019t have a reason to happen. Things happen because that\u2019s life. They occur whether there\u2019s really a reason for it to happen or not. But,\u201d He snaps his fingers. \u201cI like your attitude. Don\u2019t succumb to the fear you feel. Continue to be yourself, and things will solve.\u201d</p>\n<p>I raise an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting dark. Just follow my instructions. You\u2019ll get home.\u201d The man insists.</p>\n<p>I shrug, staring at the ground for a moment, staring at the dead leaves and twigs. I turn my back to the man. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you do it, then? If leaving was so easy?\u201d Why is a man that's rotting from the inside trying to tell me that things get better?</p>\n<p>The man is silent for a moment. \u201cYou\u2019ll understand in time.\u201d</p>\n<p>I stay still for a few moments. Then, I begin to walk back the way that I came from, then stop, and turn back towards the man. \u201cYou should come with me. If I can leave, then so should you.\" I insist.</p>\n<p>Despite his cold dead eyes, I can still sense the surprise in his expression.</p>\n<p>\u201cOnce the rotting starts, it doesn\u2019t stop. Get out before it does.\u201d</p>\n<p>I open my mouth to reply.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s gone. The building is gone. It\u2019s all gone. I hesitate, then start back the way I came again. I can\u2019t pinpoint a reason that this happened. I don't like that. I wish that I could explain. That I could figure out what all of that meant.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<hr/>\n<p>I watch from afar as he exits back the way he came. He didn't even suspect, not even once. If the rotting in my chest hadn\u2019t destroyed my ability to feel, I know that the pain would be unbearable. The fact that I've rotted past recognition, even to myself.</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/a-talk-with-a-stranger-in-the-forest\">A Talk With a Stranger in the Forest</a>\" by Mew-ltiverse, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

He's silent for a few moments. His eyes wander, staring out into the distance \u201cOnce upon a time, I got lost on my way home.\" He pauses. The wind blows strands of his long dark hair in his face. \"I\u2019ve been here ever since.\u201d His eyes trail back to me.\n\n\n\nI feel my blood go cold. I am lost. I figured if I walked far enough, I\u2019d find a way out. Is this it? Am I stuck here forever? I feel my chest tightening.\u00a0\u00a0My breath begins shaking.\u00a0\u00a0I still have so much to do. So much I want to accomplish. Did one stupid mistake really mean my life was over? I always try to find the best in things. If I knew that being so nonchalant would've caused me to end up here\u2014 \n\n\n\nI feel his hand on my shoulder again.\n\n\n\n\u201cRelax.\u201d The man says to me in a calm tone. \u201cI was... lost in a different way from you. Don\u2019t jump to conclusions. There\u2019s still time for you. I\u2026 can tell this isn\u2019t like you. Don\u2019t let me dull your spirit. That positivity, that optimism.\u201d There's an expression on his face that I can't quite pinpoint.\n\n\n\nI flinch. \u201cH-How do you know that?\u201d I stutter, growing defensive. Just who is this? Is this man even human? No, he can\u2019t be. His body is literally rotting, yet here he is, speaking and breathing. Is he breathing? I didn't know that, actually. Is he even alive?\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve been around as long as I have, you become able to pick up on certain things.\u201d The man replies. He sighs, looking up at the sky. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna get dark soon. If you turn around and exit the way you came in, you\u2019ll find your way out.\u201d\n\n\n\nI tightly grip the bag I've been carrying, feeling the plastic against my fingers. \u201cI-I\u2019m not stuck here?\u201d I feel a lump in my throat. The idea that I\u2019d accidentally get myself stuck here because I was too naive to panic. I want nothing but to panic now. I want to scream. None of this made sense.\n\n\n\nWe were both quiet for a moment.\n\n\n\nI look behind me. For the first time, I realize just how big the forest is. It\u2019s almost too big. And for the first time, I feel small. Like an ant in a movie theater.\n\n\n\nThe man puts his hands together. \u201cYou\u2019re getting caught up. I know it seems scary. But if you dwell on your fears, you\u2019ll get stuck inside of them. Just turn around. Don\u2019t close your eyes.\u201d\n\n\n\nI firmly plant my feet against the ground, clenching my fists. \u201cI\u2014 I believe things happen for a reason!\u201d I exclaim. \u201cDo you think\u2026 that this happened for a reason?\u201d I ask, unable to mask the uncertainty in my voice.\n\n\n\nThe man gives a sad laugh. I feel a chill run down my spine. I didn't know that a simple laugh could communicate so much emotion. \u201cMaybe for you. But for me, things don\u2019t have a reason to happen. Things happen because that\u2019s life. They occur whether there\u2019s really a reason for it to happen or not. But,\u201d He snaps his fingers. \u201cI like your attitude. Don\u2019t succumb to the fear you feel. Continue to be yourself, and things will solve.\u201d\n\n\n\nI raise an eyebrow.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting dark. Just follow my instructions. You\u2019ll get home.\u201d The man insists.\n\n\n\nI shrug, staring at the ground for a moment, staring at the dead leaves and twigs. I turn my back to the man. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you do it, then? If leaving was so easy?\u201d Why is a man that's rotting from the inside trying to tell me that things get better?\n\n\n\nThe man is silent for a moment. \u201cYou\u2019ll understand in time.\u201d\n\n\n\nI stay still for a few moments. Then, I begin to walk back the way that I came from, then stop, and turn back towards the man. \u201cYou should come with me. If I can leave, then so should you.\" I insist.\n\n\n\nDespite his cold dead eyes, I can still sense the surprise in his expression.\n\n\n\n\u201cOnce the rotting starts, it doesn\u2019t stop. Get out before it does.\u201d\n\n\n\nI open my mouth to reply.\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s gone. The building is gone. It\u2019s all gone. I hesitate, then start back the way I came again. I can\u2019t pinpoint a reason that this happened. I don't like that. I wish that I could explain. That I could figure out what all of that meant.\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nI watch from afar as he exits back the way he came. He didn't even suspect, not even once. If the rotting in my chest hadn\u2019t destroyed my ability to feel, I know that the pain would be unbearable. The fact that I've rotted past recognition, even to myself.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["dr-mews-personnel-file", "you-have-a-doppelgaenger", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["bleak", "creepypasta", "first-person", "surrealist-fiction", "tale"], "title": "A Talk With a Stranger in the Forest - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/a-talk-with-a-stranger-in-the-forest", "year": 2024}, "a-very-high-holiday": {"created_at": "2024-01-01T23:16:00", "creator": "Yossipossi", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Yossipossi", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/yossipossi", "comment": "\ud83c\udfb5 Haneirot Hallalu \ud83c\udfb5", "date": "2024-01-01T23:16:00"}, {"author": "Yossipossi", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/yossipossi", "comment": "Added tags: art-exchange, bittersweet, bones, esther-kogan, gamers-against-weed, lgbtq, religious-fiction, slice-of-life, tale.

Esther could leave at any time she wanted, but doing so would mean either going to the lobby and making small talk, or leaving and throwing away the money she was just barely not wasting already. Both those options sounded more torturous than what she was doing to herself now, which was absolutely nothing.</p>\n<p>So, Esther sat, staring out of the hotel window.</p>\n<p>Past her breath fogging up the glass, the road just ahead of her winded down the hill, decorated with trees only broken by the occasional building. By this time \u2014 god, it was already two in the fucking morning \u2014 most of the houses had turned off their lights, the people inside retiring to bed. <em>Her</em> bed \u2014 in this run-down, cheap-as-bricks hotel \u2014 was more like a cot, which further reinforced its prison-like atmosphere. At least the place was painted.</p>\n<p>Pacing inside the room earlier didn't seem to help her mood. Neither did kicking the wall until the hotel staff had to ask her to stop. And neither did talking to bones, G-d bless its heart. So, out of options, the serenity of blankly staring at the outside world seemed apt.</p>\n<p>As time passed and the snow began to drift more methodically onto the ground, Esther began to count the cars that occasionally drove by (twelve so far) and the number of pedestrians she spotted (only one; though he looked up at her and waved, so there was that). When her cheek began to numb painfully, she turned her chair around to stare the other direction. When that, too, began to numb her to the point of pain, she finally relented and pulled herself from the window, shuffling into the bathroom.</p>\n<p>Too many turns of the sink knobs later, she splashed warm water on her face. The bathroom was stocked only with the bare necessities, so a hot bath was out of the question. She needed one. Sorely. Not just because she hadn't showered in two days (which disgusted her to no end), but also because it'd probably do her mind some good, or as much good as it could do. For now, she settled on the warm sink water that was quickly cooling down again, and once finished, dried her face to the best of her ability. It helped, sort of.</p>\n<p>Leaving the bathroom left her in direct view of her prison cot \u2014 which was unmade because of her funk, which put her in more of a funk. Under typical circumstance, she'd never leave her bed in such a sorry state, but in her present absence of presence, she\u2014<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Knock, knock, knock.</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n\u2026Wait, what the fuck?</p>\n<p>Esther's ever-gnawing brain fog instantly evaporated at the sound of knocking. Who the <em>fuck</em> was tapping their knuckles on her door at three in the g-ddamn morning? The notion it was the hotel staff was laughable for several reasons, but that left a total of zero other candidates.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Knock, knock, knock.</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nOkay, that wasn't an accident. She cautiously reentered the bedroom (well, the only other room besides the bathroom), and cursed to herself as she realized the door didn't have a eye hole. Should she answer it? Was it possibly her hotel neighbors, here to chew her out for all the banging earlier? Did someone discover her here and want to kidnap her for G-d knows what reason?</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Knock, knock, knock.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Fuck it.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\nEsther gripped the handle tightly and, without letting herself deliberate, opened the door.</p>\n<p>The first thing she registered about the man standing in front of her is that he was almost obnoxiously Jewish. He wore a kippah on his head that almost certainly had a maggin david on it, and poking out from under his blue nylon jacket she could see four strings of tzitzit. He held a small duffel bag that had a verse written in Hebrew on it. The man also had a slightly unkempt beard that had been graying \u2014 which led her to her next realization, that he was old and very, very tired. The man's face was defined by small wrinkles and a fading-black mop of hair.</p>\n<p>The third realization scared her: she vaguely recognized him. He <em>did</em> look a bit like her father, but\u2026 no, he wasn't related. It took her a few seconds before she realized it was the man that waved at her while she was staring out the window. That, unfortunately, did very little to ease her concerns.</p>\n<p>\"Hello,\" the man spoke with a slightly Yiddish, slightly Canadian accent, \"are you Esther Kogan?\"</p>\n<p><em>That</em>, unfortunately, did quite the opposite. There were only two possible groups that could track her like this, and neither seemed pretty. The first were the Kabbalists \u2014 and if that was the case, she reckoned, she'd already be dead \u2014 and the second was\u2026</p>\n<p>Her eyes widened. She stopped breathing. The fervent beating of her heart pounded at her ears, swallowing the whole world instantly.</p>\n<p>\"You're\u2026 You're one of the <em>Janitors</em>?\"</p>\n<p>The piece of shit immediately laughed awkwardly and shook his head. \"Huh? No no, I'm not a janitor. Is it the jacket? I knew I should've picked a different one.\"</p>\n<p>Should she kill him? No, she couldn't get away with it. The Foundation didn't take kindly to killing their personnel, and if he was an older person he was probably someone significant. Which means that, most likely, she was being actively monitored and there were multiple people who could step in and quickly kill or detain or mindwipe her, so trying anything would be a death sentence. She was thankful, at least, that she had Kabbalistic memetics she could use if it came down to it.</p>\n<p>\u2026Actually.</p>\n<p>If they were here to kill her or capture her, they'd would have sent at least someone with combat experience, right? She knew some magic and a shitload of mindkillers, so either this was their best agent for the job or the man in front of her wasn't here to silence her. And if he <em>was</em> here to kill her, he wouldn't have waved at her earlier, or knocked on her door. Was he a Kabbalist?</p>\n<p>\"Are you a Kabbalist?\"</p>\n<p>The man blinked. \"You mean, with a capital K?\"</p>\n<p>She squinted at him. He shifted in place.</p>\n<p>\"No, I'm not a Kabbalist. I've had to interact with them a few times, yes, but I don't have the genes to ever actually be one. That's uh, 'genes', with a G. It's a genetic thing.\" Pause. \"I'm from the Foundation.\"</p>\n<p>Rage boiled in her chest. Holding her tongue, she asked as calmly as she could muster, \"What the <em>fuck</em> do you want?\"</p>\n<p>He flinched at the curse word. Biting his lip \u2014 he did that a lot, based on the chafing \u2014 he replied, \"It's a bit of a long story, and I'm freezing my butt off out here. Could I come in?\"</p>\n<p>Was he a lunatic? \"<em>Are you a lunatic?</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"Only a lunatic could knock on a Kabbalist's door by himself at three AM, no?\"</p>\n<p>She didn't really have a retort for that.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">\u2744     \u2744     \u2744</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>There was only one chair in the tiny hotel room, so Esther sat on her (still unmade) bed. It was clear to her that the man was uncomfortable, but he at least had the decency to not voice any complaints. His duffel bag rested besides him, and she glanced at it with suspicion. If the man <em>was</em> there to capture her, then the bag likely had some Clarkian technomagic bullshit device inside it that would stop her from using her abilities. If it came down to it, she might still be able to use <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com/jude-s-bizarre-adventure\">Hamon</a> to escape.</p>\n<p>The man coughed as he placed his jacket on the table next to her laptop (revealing a tallit and labcoat underneath), before awkwardly scooting over to face her. He seated both of his hands in his lap, rubbing them quickly to warm them, before noticing her sideward gaze at the bag.</p>\n<p>\"Ah. I'll uh, I'll get to the bag in a second.\"</p>\n<p>Esther sighed angrily. \"I'd prefer you get to it now.\"</p>\n<p>\"Just let me say my piece first. Please. I promise I'll be quick and then I'll be out of your hair.\"</p>\n<p>\"It would've been better if you never got <em>in</em> my hair to begin with. You people only ruin everything you touch. None of you understand when to leave well enough <em>alone</em>.\" She was practically hissing at him. \"The only reason I'm even tolerating your presence at all is because you clearly put a lot of effort into showing me you're Jewish, and that means <em>something</em> to me.\"</p>\n<p>The man tilted his head. \"I did? Oh\u2014 yes, I suppose I do come off pretty Orthodox. That wasn't, I mean\u2014 I'm not trying to trick you or something. This is sort of just what I normally wear.\"</p>\n<p>\"Bullshit. You're wearing a <em>tallit</em> on top of a <em>labcoat</em> at <em>three in the morning</em>.\"</p>\n<p>\"Look I\u2014\" He paused, glancing at the window, as though he was planning a daring escape, \"Can we not\u2014 can we not talk about my fashion sense, please? I know I came at three AM, but it <em>is</em> three in the morning and I do have work tomorrow.\"</p>\n<p>Oh my G-d. Oh my <em>G-d</em>. She was going to lose it. She must have had a stroke staring out the window earlier and ended up in some horrific perversion of Gehenna where she was forced to deal with senile old men for eternity.</p>\n<p>Deep breaths, Esther.</p>\n<p>\"Okay. Say your piece, and <em>get the fuck out of my room.</em>\"</p>\n<p>The man released a deep breath of his own. Esther noticed that his hands were shaking as he began to speak. Was he <em>scared</em> of her?</p>\n<p>\"Alright. Thanks.\" He fidgeted a bit, before taking a short breath and regaining his composure properly. \"So, just so we're on the same page: I'm a senior researcher at the SCP Foundation. Not going to be saying my name, because I'd probably get in trouble if they found out I'm here. I came here to, ah, give you a few gifts.\" He paused, waiting for a reaction. She didn't give him one. \"Do you have any questions so far?\"</p>\n<p>\"What are you, fucking Santa Claus?\"</p>\n<p>\"Ho ho ho. But, no. He's in containment.\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>What?</em>\"</p>\n<p>A cough. \"Uh, that was a joke. <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com/scp-5925\">Kind of.</a> It's classified. Sorry, next question.\"</p>\n<p>\"How the hell did you find me?\"</p>\n<p>She could tell something shifted in his body posture, but it was subtle enough that she couldn't pinpoint it exactly. \"Ah, well, the Foundation has a pretty extensive record on you and your group chats, and there's only so many Esther Kogans who flew to Canada this past week.\" After witnessing the disgust and horror she painted on her face, he added: \"If it makes you feel any better, the Foundation's record on <em>me</em> is probably a lot worse. They probably have a record of everything I've eaten in the past sixteen years. Not exaggerating.\"</p>\n<p>\"That doesn't make me feel better in the slightest.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh. Sorry.\" The man scratched at his kippah. \"Anything else?\"</p>\n<p><em>Deep breaths, Esther.</em> \"Yeah. Three more: why the hell are you giving <em>me</em> gifts, what the <em>fuck</em> does that entail, and what if I don't want your stupid gifts?\"</p>\n<p>To the man's credit, he was getting used to her colorful vernacular. \"I mean, I don't <em>think</em> you'll reject them. But uh, to answer the first two are\u2014 well, it's probably best to just show them, I guess. Can I?\"</p>\n<p>She hesitated. Did she <em>want</em> to see what was in that bag? For all intents and purposes it was probably something mundane, but\u2026</p>\n<p>Well, even if he was dangerous, she was pretty sure she could hurt him a lot more than he could hurt her.</p>\n<p>She nodded.</p>\n<p>The man unzipped the bag, and begun to rummage around. It took a lot of effort from him, but after a few seconds, he pulled out\u2026</p>\n<p>Oh, of course. A menorah. Fucking <em>duh</em>.</p>\n<p>\"This is for you. It's not a particularly fancy one, but uh, I figured that you probably forgot to pack one when coming up here, so I thought I'd give you one I had lying around. I also have some candles and a lighter.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's\u2026\" Esther swallowed her malcontent briefly, \"\u2026very nice of you. Thanks.\"</p>\n<p>The man seemed to glow under the praise. \"I'm glad you like it! If you need me to, I can teach you the b\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>No</em>,\" she blurted a little more harshly than she intended, \"I was raised Orthodox. I know how to light a menorah.\"</p>\n<p>The Foundationeer returned from his brief high and adjusted the collar of his shirt. \"Just making sure. I guess it was <em>hashkacha pratit</em> that I could deliver this to you.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'll be the judge of that,\" she muttered in response.</p>\n<p>The silence that followed was unbearable. She avoided eye contact with the man and instead opted to stare at the silver menorah. It wasn't cheap, she could at least tell that \u2014 it probably cost at least $40 or the equivalent in whatever currency they used in Canada. The engravings were vaguely reminiscent of a design she saw back in Three Portlands while walking home from Shul.</p>\n<p>It was becoming increasingly clear that this man in front of her genuinely did not mean her harm. But\u2026 he was still part of a system that fucked her over multiple times. He was a cog in a larger, objectively evil machine, and as nice as he supposedly was, she couldn't forgive him for that.</p>\n<p>\"Alright, uh, I suppose I should move onto the second thing. Can you promise me that you'll let me finish after I show you?\"</p>\n<p>She snapped her attention back up, tossing the menorah lightly aside onto the bed. It made a small <em>thump</em> as it landed. \"What? Sure.\"</p>\n<p>He smiled, and reaching into the bag again. This time, it took nearly no time for him to pull out what he wa\u2014</p>\n<p>Oh.</p>\n<p><em>Oh.</em></p>\n<p>In his hand was a bundle of wool, hand-knit together into a sweater. The wool was dyed a light purple and blue, haphazardly due to inexperience. To the average person, it was perfectly ordinary winter apparel, but when worn it had the thaumic capability to morphing itself to give the impression of being hugged. To the average person, it was nothing more than a supernatural sweater.</p>\n<p>To her, it was Madeline's sweater. The one she imbued with magic. The one she designed to make it feel as though she was always being hugged by her, even when they were separated by vast distance.</p>\n<p>The one that caused the Foundation to rip her girlfriend away from her.</p>\n<p>Esther's mind exploded with a multitude of contradictory emotions. Should she kill him? Should she hug him? Should she burst into tears and vomit the takeout she had earlier? Should she say <em>anything</em>?</p>\n<p>The man eventually cut through her silence for her. \"This\u2026 this is for you. I'm not involved in the acquisition of anomalies, but, I mistyped a number and accidentally landed on the file for your sweater. I looked you up, and after a bit of digging, I used my sway in the Foundation to possess the anomaly for ah, research purposes.\" He paused, trying to read the multitude of emotions constantly vying for her expression. \"I reclassified it as a item of interest, and no one's gonna look if one of those goes missing.\"</p>\n<p>\"\u2026Why\u2026?\"</p>\n<p>\"It's going to sound silly, but it was mostly just for a Hannukah gift.\" He looked down and sighed, a grimace suddenly forming on his face. \"To tell you the truth, I know the Foundation isn't the greatest organization in the world. I've done a lot of things I regret while working there. But\u2026 I thought I'd try to at least try to undo a little of the damage done to a fellow Yid. That's pretty much the main reason I'm here.\"</p>\n<p>Esther didn't speak at first. She held the sweater close to her, gripping it as though it would disappear if she let it go. Between the wires of wool she could feel the magic she weaved into it still ebb and flow, waiting patiently to fulfill a purpose that would never be realized again. Her eyes leaked a little \u2014 <em>just</em> a little \u2014 against her best attempts at quelling the emotions rising in her chest.</p>\n<p>Then, after less than a minute of silent eulogies to herself, she regained her composure and looked the Jewish man in the eye.</p>\n<p>\"\u2026You practiced that speech, didn't you?\"</p>\n<p>He shrugged. \"Guilty.\"</p>\n<p>\"Alright.\" She slowly let go of the sweater, dropping it into her lap. \"Give me your final gift, and then please leave.\"</p>\n<p>This time, instead of reaching into his bag, his hand jumped to one of his lab coat pockets, and pulled out one of the most corporate-rolled blunts Esther had ever seen in her entire life.</p>\n<p>\"I figured a weed cigarette might be a nice way to end off the visit. I know your whole group is kind of into that.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thanks, but I don't smoke.\"</p>\n<p>The man's face contorted into shock so quickly that Esther couldn't help but laugh at his confusion. Before he could reply, she qualified, \"I do. Only sometimes though. And never call it a 'weed cigarette' again.\"</p>\n<p>He sighed with relief. \"I was worried the name wasn't <em>actually</em> ironic. That would have really sucked.\"</p>\n<p>She didn't reply to him. There was a lot she had to process, still, and she began to feel the weight of an emotional clusterfuck at three A.M. weigh on her head. The man across from her could at least read <em>that</em> from her face.</p>\n<p>\"It'd probably be best if I got going,\" the man said.</p>\n<p>\"Yeah,\" Esther said despondently.</p>\n<p>\"Alright,\" the nylon jacket slipped back on, \"Thanks for giving me a bit of your time. I'm sorry I couldn't have come at a more convenient hour. I hope it was worth it for you.\"</p>\n<p>She didn't reply, only reached down and grasped the sweater in her lap again, steadying her breaths. When the man opened the door and began to step out, she called out, \"Wait.\"</p>\n<p>He glanced back in her direction.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you.\"</p>\n<p>He smiled. \"Of course. Have a <em>freilichen Purim</em>, Esther.\"</p>\n<p>\"Go fuck yourself.\"</p>\n<p>He gave one last laugh, and then he was gone.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">\u2744     \u2744     \u2744</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>Setting up a menorah is a fairly straightforward process. It was the first night, so she only needed two candles: the actual first night's candle itself, and the Shamash. It was tricky sticking the candles in (she needed to melt the bottom of the Shamash twice before it stayed upright), but it was finished in short order.</p>\n<p>With the lighter out and on, fire burning brightly against the white blanket outside the window, she quickly recited the first two blessings. With the third \u2014 <em>Shehecheyanu</em>, the prayer for thanking G-d for allowing her to reach this moment \u2014 she purposefully prolonged its recitation, keeping the feeling of the words in her mouth as long as she could say them.</p>\n<p>Then, she lit.</p>\n<p>After she finished lighting the first and only candle, she began to softly hum the tune of <em>Hannerot Hallalu</em>, the same way she <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYiVrBIASXg\">used to sing it back home</a>. Those days were long gone, and she certainly could never go back. But that thought didn't weigh so heavy on her heart anymore.</p>\n<p>When she was done with the psalm, she lifted the blunt to the Shamash until it caught, and leaned back into the chair. As she stared into the void recessed against the soft glow of the menorah, and a familiar sweater gently wrapped her in a hug, Esther took solace knowing that \u2014 regardless of the dark \u2014 there was still a little light left in the world.</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/a-very-high-holiday\">A Very High Holiday</a>\" by Yossipossi, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

When her cheek began to numb painfully, she turned her chair around to stare the other direction. When that, too, began to numb her to the point of pain, she finally relented and pulled herself from the window, shuffling into the bathroom.\n\n\n\nToo many turns of the sink knobs later, she splashed warm water on her face. The bathroom was stocked only with the bare necessities, so a hot bath was out of the question. She needed one. Sorely. Not just because she hadn't showered in two days (which disgusted her to no end), but also because it'd probably do her mind some good, or as much good as it could do. For now, she settled on the warm sink water that was quickly cooling down again, and once finished, dried her face to the best of her ability. It helped, sort of.\n\n\n\nLeaving the bathroom left her in direct view of her prison cot \u2014 which was unmade because of her funk, which put her in more of a funk.

He wore a kippah on his head that almost certainly had a maggin david on it, and poking out from under his blue nylon jacket she could see four strings of tzitzit. He held a small duffel bag that had a verse written in Hebrew on it. The man also had a slightly unkempt beard that had been graying \u2014 which led her to her next realization, that he was old and very, very tired. The man's face was defined by small wrinkles and a fading-black mop of hair.\n\n\n\nThe third realization scared her: she vaguely recognized him. He //did// look a bit like her father, but... no, he wasn't related. It took her a few seconds before she realized it was the man that waved at her while she was staring out the window.

The Foundation didn't take kindly to killing their personnel, and if he was an older person he was probably someone significant. Which means that, most likely, she was being actively monitored and there were multiple people who could step in and quickly kill or detain or mindwipe her, so trying anything would be a death sentence. She was thankful, at least, that she had Kabbalistic memetics she could use if it came down to it.\n\n\n\n...Actually.\n\n\n\nIf they were here to kill her or capture her, they'd would have sent at least someone with combat experience, right?

She avoided eye contact with the man and instead opted to stare at the silver menorah. It wasn't cheap, she could at least tell that \u2014 it probably cost at least $40 or the equivalent in whatever currency they used in Canada.

The wool was dyed a light purple and blue, haphazardly due to inexperience. To the average person, it was perfectly ordinary winter apparel, but when worn it had the thaumic capability to morphing itself to give the impression of being hugged. To the average person, it was nothing more than a supernatural sweater.\n\n\n\nTo her, it was Madeline's sweater. The one she imbued with magic. The one she designed to make it feel as though she was always being hugged by her, even when they were separated by vast distance.\n\n\n\nThe one that caused the Foundation to rip her girlfriend away from her.\n\n\n\nEsther's mind exploded with a multitude of contradictory emotions. Should she kill him? Should she hug him? Should she burst into tears and vomit the takeout she had earlier? Should she say //anything//?\n\n\n\nThe man eventually cut through her silence for her. \"This... this is for you. I'm not involved in the acquisition of anomalies, but, I mistyped a number and accidentally landed on the file for your sweater. I looked you up, and after a bit of digging, I used my sway in the Foundation to possess the anomaly for ah, research purposes.\" He paused, trying to read the multitude of emotions constantly vying for her expression. \"I reclassified it as a item of interest, and no one's gonna look if one of those goes missing.\"\n\n\n\n\"...Why...?\"\n\n\n\n\"It's going to sound silly, but it was mostly just for a Hannukah gift.\" He looked down and sighed, a grimace suddenly forming on his face. \"To tell you the truth, I know the Foundation isn't the greatest organization in the world. I've done a lot of things I regret while working there. But... I thought I'd try to at least try to undo a little of the damage done to a fellow Yid. That's pretty much the main reason I'm here.\"\n\n\n\nEsther didn't speak at first. She held the sweater close to her, gripping it as though it would disappear if she let it go. Between the wires of wool she could feel the magic she weaved into it still ebb and flow, waiting patiently to fulfill a purpose that would never be realized again. Her eyes leaked a little \u2014 //just// a little \u2014 against her best attempts at quelling the emotions rising in her chest.\n\n\n\nThen, after less than a minute of silent eulogies to herself, she regained her composure and looked the Jewish man in the eye. \n\n\n\n\"...You practiced that speech, didn't you?\" \n\n\n\nHe shrugged. \"Guilty.\"\n\n\n\n\"Alright.\" She slowly let go of the sweater, dropping it into her lap. \"Give me your final gift, and then please leave.\"\n\n\n\nThis time, instead of reaching into his bag, his hand jumped to one of his lab coat pockets, and pulled out one of the most corporate-rolled blunts Esther had ever seen in her entire life.\n\n\n\n\"I figured a weed cigarette might be a nice way to end off the visit. I know your whole group is kind of into that.\"\n\n\n\n\"Thanks, but I don't smoke.\"\n\n\n\nThe man's face contorted into shock so quickly that Esther couldn't help but laugh at his confusion. Before he could reply, she qualified, \"I do. Only sometimes though. And never call it a 'weed cigarette' again.\"\n\n\n\nHe sighed with relief. \"I was worried the name wasn't //actually// ironic. That would have really sucked.\"\n\n\n\nShe didn't reply to him.

It had only taken a few lunch outings and invites to office parties for Lost to fall hopelessly dependent on West\u2019s companionship. From there, they\u2019d been Sage\u2019s best asset.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Sage said, nodding.

She didn\u2019t want to review all of this just standing in Lost\u2019s office. Standing in the stuffy room with the nervous pushover breathing down her neck like a cockroach didn\u2019t sound appealing either. \u201cThanks a million, Val. You\u2019re the best.\u201d</p>\n<p>Val was the more endearing nickname of the two Sage had given the researcher, standing for Viktoralai Amity Lost - their full name. It made Lost blush faintly, grinning a crooked smile back. \u201cOf course, anytime! Actually, if you want to get coffee later, I have a free hour aft-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSee you later!\u201d Sage called, shutting the door before Lost could finish their thought. She didn\u2019t have the time to bluster through polite excuses right now, and if Lost wanted company, they could ask Levi or something. The stocky blonde from Containment was always taking on pet projects.</p>\n<p>Sage\u2019s pet projects usually involved the chatter of white rats and late nights spent bent over computer charts.</p>\n<p>As she walked down the hall, she blew past a tall girl - and was nearly struck still. Beautiful, wavy black hair, pale skin and pink cupid\u2019s bow lips. A regal, frosty Snow White in a silver dress and black tights. Obviously not dressed for any sort of work.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh- hey,\u201d the girl blew out a puff of air, scrutinizing Sage. \u201cDo you know where the Director is? I\u2019ve been looking around but can\u2019t find her.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sage scowled. She debated just walking away - then sighed. \u201cI\u2019m going to see her right now. You can follow me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Polished black heels followed behind Sage\u2019s quick step, up the stairs that led to Director Emerald Reynolds\u2019 office. They were opposite shades of the same glossy beauty - Sage\u2019s swathes of freckles, her ginger hair scooped into a french twist, and rose gold charm bracelet jangling against her wrist. A small pack of dynamite. Then, the cool silver of her taller companion. A poison-tipped icicle.</p>\n<p>Director Emerald Reynolds had the same power, if not the elegance. Black slacks, blonde hair scooped into a tight ponytail, with deep eye bags polishing off the look. She looked up, snapping alert as they entered the sparsley decorated room.</p>\n<p>\u201cMiss Vega,\u201d Reynolds spoke, eyes widening. Sage huffed, unhappy she hadn\u2019t been the first order of business.</p>\n<p>\u201cEmerald,\u201d said Miss Vega - the beautiful girl\u2019s name, it seemed - and she curtsied. Sage gritted her teeth.</p>\n<p>\u201cReynolds,\u201d she started, stepping forwards. \u201cCan I talk with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you do the research I asked you to?\u201d Reynolds responded, raising an eyebrow. Sage nodded. \u201cThe Deus ex machina. Is that what you wanted me to find?\u201d</p>\n<p>A small smile crossed the tall Director\u2019s thin lips. \u201cGood. I\u2019ve already submitted a request for you to use it. If it gets approved, I\u2019ll email you with more details,\u201d she lifted her chin. \u201cYou worked fast. That\u2019s good.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sage blinked- surprised both by the praise, and the foresight from Reynolds. \u201cOh,\u201d was all she said. She wasn\u2019t sure how she felt about being caught off guard - it wasn\u2019t a common emotion for her. \u201c\u2026 thank you,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>Reynolds had already moved her attention away, eyes focusing on Vega. \u201cYou\u2019re dismissed, Dr. West. I have\u2026 matters of importance to discuss with Estrella.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sage paused. \u201cEstrella?\u201d The name clicked into place- Estrella Vega. Daughter of Marilla Vega. Sage turned, raking her gaze over Estrella once again, taking in all the details she\u2019d missed in her first quick assessment. The designer watch on her wrist, the small charm necklace. A shift from gaudily polished to classically wealthy.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 right,\u201d West said, feeling Reynolds\u2019 stare burning into her. Turning back, she stepped back through the office doorway, hearing it click behind her. In her head, she made a quick note in her priorities - finish the work with the poison for Loveland, get the research on the memetic symbol back from Lost, update Jack on the murder case once that happened\u2026</p>\n<p>And take a closer look into the world of Estrella Vega.</p>\n<p>To quote the endlessly dragging prose of Hatchet, <em>there were these things to do, or whatever.</em></p>\n<div class=\"email-example\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Access\u00a0SCiPNET\u00a0Email?\u00a0One\u00a0(1)\u00a0new\u00a0message!</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">Re:SUBJECT</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<div class=\"email\">\n<div class=\"tofrom\">\n<p><strong>To:</strong> <span class=\"wiki-email\">ten.pics|sdlonyeR.dlaremE#ten.pics|sdlonyeR.dlaremE</span><br/>\n<strong>From:</strong> <span class=\"wiki-email\">ten.pics|lexA.nylasoR#ten.pics|lexA.nylasoR</span><br/>\n<strong>Subject:</strong> Re:USE REQUEST ON SCP-2000</p>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>Director Reynolds,</p>\n<p>I will say, first and foremost, that I am very hesitant in doing this.

Near-human in appearance, the creatures share much of their physiology with those of the <em><a href=\"/nx-03\">Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann</a></em>, with the exception of their teeth, which are jagged, and eyes, of which the sclera is of a black hue. Observation has determined their intelligence and sapience to be near, if not identical, to that of a human.</p>\n<p><strong>Abnormality:</strong> The creatures possess a number of unusual qualities, both in their behaviour and biology. Their most notable quality is their regenerative capabilities, which grant them suspended age and recovery of almost all forms of physical damage, including conditions which would normally be deemed unrecoverable such as decapitation or severe mutilation. This quality also appears to dull their sense of pain and grant them an enhanced physique.</p>\n<p>There are, however, exceptions. Wounds inflicted through weapons heavy in iron or silver do not recover as quickly. Sunlight also appears to impede their regenerative capabilities, resulting in their flesh quickly becoming rigid, blistered and gangrenous. Even with these exceptions, the creatures require continuous, prolonged exposure before they would be considered impossible for them to resurrect.</p>\n<p>The creatures also possess an unusual diet, as they do not require human food to survive. Rather, the creatures are hematophagous, consuming blood, primarily from other hominids. The death of the prey is not necessary, although the creatures typically do not leave their prey in a recoverable condition. However, it is noted that the nourishment the creatures gain doesn't actually come from the blood itself but rather through ritualistic theurgy. Specifically, the act of hunting, harvesting, murder or battle is required alongside the consumption of blood, in order to gain any source of sustenance.</p>\n<p>The creatures are believed to be sterile, although this claim has yet to be confirmed by observation. Whilst the creatures haven't been observed breeding, they are capable of performing a theurgic, xenogenetic metamorphosis, in which they endow their anomaly qualities into another individual. How this is achieved is not known and requires further research. As of this publication, only individuals of the <em>Tuatha</em> have been successful victims of this metamorphosis. It is unknown if this is due to some theurgic requirement or tradition on the creatures' part.</p>\n<p><strong>History:</strong> Whilst the creatures' existence has only managed to live in folktales and legends for the human population of Ireland, those of the <em>Tuatha</em> have an extensive history with them <em>(as detailed in the accompanying piece by Lord Blackwood's conference with Hy-Brasil's reigning monarch, Nuada Airgetl\u00e1m VII)</em>. The first case of the creatures' existence registered by Her Majesty's Foundation was during an investigation into a series of murders in Manchester. All the victims, as well as having been heavily beaten, had bite marks over their bodies and had undergone moderate exsanguination. The criminal, who'd arrived in England under the guise of a longshoremen named <em>Paule Byrne</em>, was eventually traced to a brothel where theurgists were, after he refused to be detained, exterminate him.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"document\">\n\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Manifest 243 (A) :</strong> Lord Blackwood's envoy to Hy-Brasil</p>\n<p>A report delivered to Her Majesty's Foundation on the culture and history of <em>\"Hy-Brasil\"</em> and its inhibitors, the <em>\"Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann\"</em>. The report's writer, Lord Theodore Blackwood, was assisting Her Majesty's Foundation in establishing relations and possible intervention policies with the kingdom's rulers and governors. Information believed to be regarding AO-243 was noted in Blackwood's report.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"color: navy\"><em>After my stroll with the King, I was taken to the banqueting hall, where I was presented with the most delicious meal: fine claret, golden fish and sweet, silver apples. The King was delighted with my enjoyment, remarking how it pained him how closed his kingdom was to the world outside and how wonderful it was to have it appreciated.</em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: navy\"><em>Soon, we spoke of the land's history and I learnt of the people's brutal strife for survival. As he spoke, I saw a great sadness within the King. A regret, mixed with a longing and a weariness. In an attempt to lighten his heart, I asked him of his mages and builders, remarking how beautiful and ingenious his <a href=\"/scp-7010\">wards</a> were. My efforts worked and the King talked in great detail of his people's skills with magic and theurgy, allowing them to bend the elements and fates with little work.</em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: navy\"><em>However, when I asked about their military, the King remained silent for a moment, perturbed. Knowing I had once again touched on a subject of great sensitivity, I apologised. The King, however, raised a hand and sighed, saying it would be better to know rather than hide the story in shame. With that, we left the hall and I was taken to the chambers beneath the palace.</em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: navy\"><em>In the touch light, I saw the chamber lined with tapestries. All depicting various events. Battles, coronations, funerals, weddings and tragedies. I saw a tapestry of Nuada Airgetl\u00e1m I, being crowned the first king to the cheers of thousands. Another tapestry showed Lugh III and Mal I in battle, waring against <a href=\"/scp-6916\">Arawn ap Carnonos</a> and his army of ghosts and giants. And one, newer than the others, depicted a <a href=\"/lte-0851-cetus\">beast</a> rising from the sea, flames filling the skies.</em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: navy\"><em>The King woke me from my trace and pointed to a tapestry. In its cloth, I saw an image of horror. A field lined with bodies and blood. In the centre, two men fought, one of whom I recognised as the husband of Sadhbh II, Fionn, holding a sword with a wooden hilt. The other man was dwarfed and had hair of wild cinnabar, teeth as sharp as daggers and eyes filled with malice. Around them, in a frenzy of blood and fury, men and women were screaming and laughing. All shared the dwarf's abhorrent glare and maw. And in the sky, cutting through the dark, crimson clouds, stood a woman all in <a href=\"/scp-179\">black</a>, showering Fionn in golden light.</em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: navy\"><em>As I took in the image, the King told me the dwarf's tale. With the fall of the <a href=\"/nx-02\">Mabyn</a>, the kingdom of the Tuatha, which had once spanned the highlands of Scotland as well as Ireland, was now vulnerable to the coming threats from the east. As they had depleted so much of their magic and weaponry from their war with Mabyn, the monarchy elected to abandon the highlands and retreated to Ireland.</em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: navy\"><em>As the years passed, Great Britain was invaded and colonised by several forces, but Ireland remained untouched and the Tuatha lived in quiet. Whilst many of the monarchy's people supported their ruler's choice, some remained bitter and vengeful. This bitterness was at its most potent within the Fianna, the theurgic warriors of the Tuatha. They had come to see their people as weak and lacking pride, with their leader, the dwarf knight, Abhartach, leading this shame.</em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: navy\"><em>Wishing to restore their honour, Abhartach eventually asked his Queen, Sadhbh, to lead a crusade against the foreign rulers of Britain and claim back their land. The Queen refused, concerned only for the safety of her people. Enraged, Abhartach and his men sought to overthrow the monarchy and searched for ways to equal their power. Eventually, he sought the wisdom of the Aos S\u00ed, cruel beings with old magic and wings like glass. The Aos S\u00ed agreed to grant Abhartach's boon, on the condition he would be an ally to them if they ever needed him. Reluctantly, Abhartach agreed.</em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: navy\"><em>Using their power, the Aos S\u00ed granted Abhartach and his men's boon in the form of a new life. One free from the touches of death or time and rich in health and strength. They became the Neamh-Mairbh, men beyond death. But this boon would require blood to complete the promise. The blood of an enemy. Abhartach, now blinded by the power of his new shape and fuelled by his disgust for foreigners, choose a visiting Gaul priestess. One night, he and his men ambushed the priestess in her quarters, ripped her throat out and drank her blood, completing their contract with the Aos S\u00ed.</em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: navy\"><em>With his army of immortals, Abhartach lead the Neamh-Mairbh in a nocturnal ambush, attacking his former home and people. In the bloodbath, the army claimed many lives, including their former Queen. Her husband tried in vain to fight the army, but as they were fuelled by magic, only iron or silver would harm the immortals, a substance no Tuatha could not touch. Try as he might, Fionn and his people could not win.</em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: navy\"><em>Then, as the dawn broke, a miracle occurred. As the clouds parted, the immortals began to scream in pain in the light of the Sun, their flesh decaying and blistering. For in his pride and greed, Abhartach had made one mistake. The priestess he and his army had killed had not been a follower of a earthly faith. She was a follower of the <a href=\"/second-hytoth-hub\">Seven</a> and with her death, was granted apotheosis, becoming one with the heavens and Sun. With her assent, she banished Abhartach and his army form the light of the heavens, bringing them agony and weakness if they ever entered it.</em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: navy\"><em>With the heavens now on his side, Fionn and his men destroyed many of the Neamh-Mairbh and eventually won the battle. Victorious but vulnerable, Fionn wished to punish his wife's and people's killers with a fate worse than death. So his theurgists had Abhartach and his remaining army bound in chains of silver and sealed in caves in the north, trapping them in eternal pain. But even as the caves were closed, Abhartach vowed he would return to claim his right, one day. One day, the Neamh-Mairbh would return.</em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: navy\"><em>As he finished the tale, I asked the King if Abhartach ever fulfilled his promise. He claimed he did not know as years later, his people fled once again, rebuilding Hy-Brasil as their last home. For now, there was only tales and rumours of his return and he did not give in to fantasies easily. I thanked him for telling me his people's tale and proposed we return to the palace to continue our journey. Agreeing, we left the chambers and returned to the light of day.</em></span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"document\">\n\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Manifest 243 (B) :</strong> Suspect 230</p>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-right\" style=\"width:280px;\"><img alt=\"George_chapman_illo.jpg\" class=\"image\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/George_chapman_illo.jpg\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\">\n<p>Suspect 230, Lysander Agnew</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Subjects Name:</strong> Lysander Ruthven Agnew</p>\n<p><strong>Nationality:</strong> Irish</p>\n<p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Trade Route manager at <em>Layton &amp; Sons<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup></em></p>\n<p><strong>Perpetration:</strong> After the successful disposal of an AO-243 entity, Her Majesty's Foundation began an investigation into his travels prior to arriving in Manchester. It was eventually discovered that the entity calling himself <em>Paule Byrne</em> had made several journeys with the shipping company <em>Layton &amp; Sons</em>. When the company's passenger manifest was investigated further, it was found that 6 other individuals had also used the name, in various locations across Canada, the United States of America, the United Kingdom, France and the Netherlands, suggesting that the name <em>Paule Byrne</em> was a pseudonym used by multiple people.</p>\n<p>The case's head investigator, Inspector Henry, later learnt through a contact in the American Secure Containment Initiative that the name was linked to a series of murders and kidnappings that had occurred in the Northeast United States and Eastern Canada. Furthermore, when the passenger manifests were compared with the cargo documentation, Henry found that in a majority of the <em>Paule Byrne</em> returning journeys, additional cargo had been assigned to them, all to be delivered to Cork, Ireland.</p>\n<p>When Henry contacted <em>Layton &amp; Sons</em>, their archivists revealed that all the shipments had been approved by one of the company trade route managers, <em>Lysander Ruthven Agnew</em> and the cargo had supposedly contained medical supplies and biochemical materials, though no one could confirm this was the case. When Her Majesty's Foundation attempted to trace <em>Lysander Ruthven Agnew</em>, they found that several documents had been destroyed or lost. Further interviews with several <em>Layton &amp; Sons</em> employees found that they possessed no information regarding their manager's whereabouts or associates. However, a few were able to provide a description of him, which illustrators were able to work into a sketch. Due to his connections to the inexplicable cargo, <em>Lysander Ruthven Agnew</em> has been assigned as a Suspect.</p>\n<p>Believing the illicit trading, destruction of administrative documents and the involvement of AO-243 implied a criminal syndicate had infiltrated multiple Irish and British establishments, likely involving several AO-243 entities, Inspector Henry was assigned as the head of the AO-243 annulment project.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"document\">\n\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><strong>Proposal: Request the right to alert and establish entente with Tuatha in annulling the AO-243 threat.</strong></p>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>Most esteemed gentlemen of the Operations Council,</p>\n<p>I regret to inform you that Intelligence operatives, Jared Mint and Beiye Zhao, were killed in the line of duty yesterday. Both had been involved in the AO-243 annulment project and had been posted to investigate the anomaly's possible activities in Ullapool, Scotland. They were recovered from the dockyard port, both having been drained of blood and moderately mutilated. We do not know how many attackers were involved.</p>\n<p>When the Physician operative examined the bite marks made by the entities, it found that some of the marks did not match the teeth structure of a Tuatha and were closer to that of an adult human. This would imply that our understanding of 243's breeding methods isn't entirely correct. 243 are capable of breeding with humans as well as Tuatha.</p>\n<p>Not only have the deaths of two Intelligence operatives resulted in a depletion in manpower, but we have also underestimated the threat 243 poses. It is for this reason I request that we reach out to the Hy-Brasil monarchy and government and alert them of the return of 243. The Tuatha are more knowledgeable of this anomaly's history and capabilities than us and their assistance in the project would provide substantial intelligence and workforce. Not only that, this would also strengthen our diplomatic relations with them.</p>\n<p>I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<h5 id=\"toc1\"><span>- Nathanial Henry</span></h5>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size:60%;\">DO NOT WRITE BELOW THIS LINE, OFFICIAL USE ONLY.</span></p>\n<hr/>\n<h3 id=\"toc2\"><span><em><span style=\"color: navy\">Proposal approved.</span></em></span></h3>\n<h3 id=\"toc3\"><span><em>- <span style=\"color: navy\">Chamberlains 1, 2, 4, and 5.</span></em></span></h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"footnotes-footer\">\n<div class=\"title\">Footnotes</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-1\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-1')\">1</a>.

[!-- Always start with AO- --]\n\n\n\n**Threat:** Enraged. [!-- None, Benign, Irascible, Enraged --]\n\n\n\n**Classifications:** Hominid, Nocturnal, Infective, Thaumaturgic, Transvection, Regenerative. [!-- Brief descriptions of anomaly --]\n\n\n\n**Stored:** //Anomaly remains unchecked.//[!-- Where is the anomaly kept or located --]\n\n\n\n**Identifiers:** Anomaly encompasses an entire theurgical augmented group of hominids native to Ireland. Near-human in appearance, the creatures share much of their physiology with those of the //[[[nx-03|Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann]]]//, with the exception of their teeth, which are jagged, and eyes, of which the sclera is of a black hue. Observation has determined their intelligence and sapience to be near, if not identical, to that of a human.[!-- How does the anomaly usually look --]\n\n\n\n**Abnormality:** The creatures possess a number of unusual qualities, both in their behaviour and biology. Their most notable quality is their regenerative capabilities, which grant them suspended age and recovery of almost all forms of physical damage, including conditions which would normally be deemed unrecoverable such as decapitation or severe mutilation. This quality also appears to dull their sense of pain and grant them an enhanced physique.\n\n\n\nThere are, however, exceptions. Wounds inflicted through weapons heavy in iron or silver do not recover as quickly. Sunlight also appears to impede their regenerative capabilities, resulting in their flesh quickly becoming rigid, blistered and gangrenous. Even with these exceptions, the creatures require continuous, prolonged exposure before they would be considered impossible for them to resurrect.\n\n\n\nThe creatures also possess an unusual diet, as they do not require human food to survive. Rather, the creatures are hematophagous, consuming blood, primarily from other hominids. The death of the prey is not necessary, although the creatures typically do not leave their prey in a recoverable condition. However, it is noted that the nourishment the creatures gain doesn't actually come from the blood itself but rather through ritualistic theurgy. Specifically, the act of hunting, harvesting, murder or battle is required alongside the consumption of blood, in order to gain any source of sustenance.\n\n\n\nThe creatures are believed to be sterile, although this claim has yet to be confirmed by observation. Whilst the creatures haven't been observed breeding, they are capable of performing a theurgic, xenogenetic metamorphosis, in which they endow their anomaly qualities into another individual. How this is achieved is not known and requires further research. As of this publication, only individuals of the //Tuatha// have been successful victims of this metamorphosis. It is unknown if this is due to some theurgic requirement or tradition on the creatures' part.\n\n[!-- How does the anomaly usually behave and what makes this unusual --]\n\n\n\n**History:** Whilst the creatures' existence has only managed to live in folktales and legends for the human population of Ireland, those of the //Tuatha// have an extensive history with them //(as detailed in the accompanying piece by Lord Blackwood's conference with Hy-Brasil's reigning monarch, Nuada Airgetl\u00e1m VII)//. The first case of the creatures' existence registered by Her Majesty's Foundation was during an investigation into a series of murders in Manchester. All the victims, as well as having been heavily beaten, had bite marks over their bodies and had undergone moderate exsanguination. The criminal, who'd arrived in England under the guise of a longshoremen named //Paule Byrne//, was eventually traced to a brothel where theurgists were, after he refused to be detained, exterminate him.[!-- How did the anomaly come under the control of HMFSCP --]\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n\n[[>]]\n\n[[image https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Coat_of_arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%28black_and_white%29.svg style=\"width:10%;\"link=#]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n-----\n\n**Manifest 243 (A) :** Lord Blackwood's envoy to Hy-Brasil\n\n\n\nA report delivered to Her Majesty's Foundation on the culture and history of //\"Hy-Brasil\"// and its inhibitors, the //\"Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann\"//. The report's writer, Lord Theodore Blackwood, was assisting Her Majesty's Foundation in establishing relations and possible intervention policies with the kingdom's rulers and governors. Information believed to be regarding AO-243 was noted in Blackwood's report.\n\n-----\n\n\n\n##navy|//After my stroll with the King, I was taken to the banqueting hall, where I was presented with the most delicious meal: fine claret, golden fish and sweet, silver apples. The King was delighted with my enjoyment, remarking how it pained him how closed his kingdom was to the world outside and how wonderful it was to have it appreciated.//##\n\n\n\n##navy|//Soon, we spoke of the land's history and I learnt of the people's brutal strife for survival. As he spoke, I saw a great sadness within the King. A regret, mixed with a longing and a weariness. In an attempt to lighten his heart, I asked him of his mages and builders, remarking how beautiful and ingenious his [[[SCP-7010|wards]]] were. My efforts worked and the King talked in great detail of his people's skills with magic and theurgy, allowing them to bend the elements and fates with little work.//##\n\n\n\n##navy|//However, when I asked about their military, the King remained silent for a moment, perturbed. Knowing I had once again touched on a subject of great sensitivity, I apologised. The King, however, raised a hand and sighed, saying it would be better to know rather than hide the story in shame. With that, we left the hall and I was taken to the chambers beneath the palace.//##\n\n\n\n##navy|//In the touch light, I saw the chamber lined with tapestries. All depicting various events. Battles, coronations, funerals, weddings and tragedies. I saw a tapestry of Nuada Airgetl\u00e1m I, being crowned the first king to the cheers of thousands. Another tapestry showed Lugh III and Mal I in battle, waring against [[[SCP-6916|Arawn ap Carnonos]]] and his army of ghosts and giants. And one, newer than the others, depicted a [[[lte-0851-cetus|beast]]] rising from the sea, flames filling the skies.//##\n\n\n\n##navy|//The King woke me from my trace and pointed to a tapestry. In its cloth, I saw an image of horror. A field lined with bodies and blood. In the centre, two men fought, one of whom I recognised as the husband of Sadhbh II, Fionn, holding a sword with a wooden hilt. The other man was dwarfed and had hair of wild cinnabar, teeth as sharp as daggers and eyes filled with malice. Around them, in a frenzy of blood and fury, men and women were screaming and laughing. All shared the dwarf's abhorrent glare and maw. And in the sky, cutting through the dark, crimson clouds, stood a woman all in [[[SCP-179|black]]], showering Fionn in golden light.//##\n\n\n\n##navy|//As I took in the image, the King told me the dwarf's tale. With the fall of the [[[nx-02|Mabyn]]], the kingdom of the Tuatha, which had once spanned the highlands of Scotland as well as Ireland, was now vulnerable to the coming threats from the east. As they had depleted so much of their magic and weaponry from their war with Mabyn, the monarchy elected to abandon the highlands and retreated to Ireland.//##\n\n\n\n##navy|//As the years passed, Great Britain was invaded and colonised by several forces, but Ireland remained untouched and the Tuatha lived in quiet. Whilst many of the monarchy's people supported their ruler's choice, some remained bitter and vengeful. This bitterness was at its most potent within the Fianna, the theurgic warriors of the Tuatha. They had come to see their people as weak and lacking pride, with their leader, the dwarf knight, Abhartach, leading this shame.//##\n\n\n\n##navy|//Wishing to restore their honour, Abhartach eventually asked his Queen, Sadhbh, to lead a crusade against the foreign rulers of Britain and claim back their land. The Queen refused, concerned only for the safety of her people. Enraged, Abhartach and his men sought to overthrow the monarchy and searched for ways to equal their power. Eventually, he sought the wisdom of the Aos S\u00ed, cruel beings with old magic and wings like glass. The Aos S\u00ed agreed to grant Abhartach's boon, on the condition he would be an ally to them if they ever needed him. Reluctantly, Abhartach agreed.//##\n\n\n\n##navy|//Using their power, the Aos S\u00ed granted Abhartach and his men's boon in the form of a new life. One free from the touches of death or time and rich in health and strength. They became the Neamh-Mairbh, men beyond death. But this boon would require blood to complete the promise. The blood of an enemy. Abhartach, now blinded by the power of his new shape and fuelled by his disgust for foreigners, choose a visiting Gaul priestess. One night, he and his men ambushed the priestess in her quarters, ripped her throat out and drank her blood, completing their contract with the Aos S\u00ed.//##\n\n\n\n##navy|//With his army of immortals, Abhartach lead the Neamh-Mairbh in a nocturnal ambush, attacking his former home and people. In the bloodbath, the army claimed many lives, including their former Queen. Her husband tried in vain to fight the army, but as they were fuelled by magic, only iron or silver would harm the immortals, a substance no Tuatha could not touch. Try as he might, Fionn and his people could not win.//##\n\n\n\n##navy|//Then, as the dawn broke, a miracle occurred. As the clouds parted, the immortals began to scream in pain in the light of the Sun, their flesh decaying and blistering. For in his pride and greed, Abhartach had made one mistake. The priestess he and his army had killed had not been a follower of a earthly faith. She was a follower of the [[[second-hytoth-hub|Seven]]] and with her death, was granted apotheosis, becoming one with the heavens and Sun. With her assent, she banished Abhartach and his army form the light of the heavens, bringing them agony and weakness if they ever entered it.//##\n\n\n\n##navy|//With the heavens now on his side, Fionn and his men destroyed many of the Neamh-Mairbh and eventually won the battle. Victorious but vulnerable, Fionn wished to punish his wife's and people's killers with a fate worse than death. So his theurgists had Abhartach and his remaining army bound in chains of silver and sealed in caves in the north, trapping them in eternal pain. But even as the caves were closed, Abhartach vowed he would return to claim his right, one day. One day, the Neamh-Mairbh would return.//##\n\n\n\n##navy|//As he finished the tale, I asked the King if Abhartach ever fulfilled his promise. He claimed he did not know as years later, his people fled once again, rebuilding Hy-Brasil as their last home. For now, there was only tales and rumours of his return and he did not give in to fantasies easily. I thanked him for telling me his people's tale and proposed we return to the palace to continue our journey. Agreeing, we left the chambers and returned to the light of day.//##\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n\n[[>]]\n\n[[image https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Coat_of_arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%28black_and_white%29.svg style=\"width:10%;\"link=#]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n-----\n\n**Manifest 243 (B) :** Suspect 230\n\n-----\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:image-block\">:scp-wiki:component:image-block</a> name=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/George_chapman_illo.jpg |caption=Suspect 230, Lysander Agnew|width=280px]]\n\n**Subjects Name:** Lysander Ruthven Agnew\n\n\n\n**Nationality:** Irish\n\n\n\n**Occupation:** Trade Route manager at //Layton & Sons[[footnote]] A shipbuilding and shipping company based in Cork, Ireland. Specialised in Canadian Arctic, Atlantic and North Sea shipping routes. [[/footnote]]//\n\n\n\n**Perpetration:** After the successful disposal of an AO-243 entity, Her Majesty's Foundation began an investigation into his travels prior to arriving in Manchester. It was eventually discovered that the entity calling himself //Paule Byrne// had made several journeys with the shipping company //Layton & Sons//. When the company's passenger manifest was investigated further, it was found that 6 other individuals had also used the name, in various locations across Canada, the United States of America, the United Kingdom, France and the Netherlands, suggesting that the name //Paule Byrne// was a pseudonym used by multiple people.\n\n\n\nThe case's head investigator, Inspector Henry, later learnt through a contact in the American Secure Containment Initiative that the name was linked to a series of murders and kidnappings that had occurred in the Northeast United States and Eastern Canada. Furthermore, when the passenger manifests were compared with the cargo documentation, Henry found that in a majority of the //Paule Byrne// returning journeys, additional cargo had been assigned to them, all to be delivered to Cork, Ireland.\n\n\n\nWhen Henry contacted //Layton & Sons//, their archivists revealed that all the shipments had been approved by one of the company trade route managers, //Lysander Ruthven Agnew// and the cargo had supposedly contained medical supplies and biochemical materials, though no one could confirm this was the case. When Her Majesty's Foundation attempted to trace //Lysander Ruthven Agnew//, they found that several documents had been destroyed or lost. Further interviews with several //Layton & Sons// employees found that they possessed no information regarding their manager's whereabouts or associates. However, a few were able to provide a description of him, which illustrators were able to work into a sketch. Due to his connections to the inexplicable cargo, //Lysander Ruthven Agnew// has been assigned as a Suspect.\n\n\n\nBelieving the illicit trading, destruction of administrative documents and the involvement of AO-243 implied a criminal syndicate had infiltrated multiple Irish and British establishments, likely involving several AO-243 entities, Inspector Henry was assigned as the head of the AO-243 annulment project.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n\n[[>]]\n\n[[image https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Coat_of_arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%28black_and_white%29.svg style=\"width:10%;\"link=#]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n-----\n\n[[=]]\n\n**Proposal: Request the right to alert and establish entente with Tuatha in annulling the AO-243 threat.**\n\n[[/=]]\n\n-----\n\n\n\nMost esteemed gentlemen of the Operations Council,\n\n\n\nI regret to inform you that Intelligence operatives, Jared Mint and Beiye Zhao, were killed in the line of duty yesterday. Both had been involved in the AO-243 annulment project and had been posted to investigate the anomaly's possible activities in Ullapool, Scotland. They were recovered from the dockyard port, both having been drained of blood and moderately mutilated. We do not know how many attackers were involved.\n\n\n\nWhen the Physician operative examined the bite marks made by the entities, it found that some of the marks did not match the teeth structure of a Tuatha and were closer to that of an adult human. This would imply that our understanding of 243's breeding methods isn't entirely correct. 243 are capable of breeding with humans as well as Tuatha.\n\n\n\nNot only have the deaths of two Intelligence operatives resulted in a depletion in manpower, but we have also underestimated the threat 243 poses. It is for this reason I request that we reach out to the Hy-Brasil monarchy and government and alert them of the return of 243. The Tuatha are more knowledgeable of this anomaly's history and capabilities than us and their assistance in the project would provide substantial intelligence and workforce. Not only that, this would also strengthen our diplomatic relations with them.\n\n\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n+++++ - Nathanial Henry\n\n[[/>]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[size 60%]]DO NOT WRITE BELOW THIS LINE, OFFICIAL USE ONLY.[[/size]]\n\n-----\n\n+++ //##navy|Proposal approved.##//\n\n+++ //- ##navy|Chamberlains 1, 2, 4, and 5.##//\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n> **Filename:** Vampire.jpg\n\n> **Name:** George Chapman\n\n> **Author:** newspaper\n\n> **License:** Public Domain\n\n> **Source Link:**\n\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Coat_of_arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%28black_and_white%29.svg\n\n> **Name:** Royal coat of the arms of the United Kingdom\n\n> **Author:** Reynolds Stone\n\n> **License:** CC BY 4.0\n\n> **Source Link:**\n\n=====\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["dr-dafydd-s-personnel-file", "nx-03", "scp-7010", "scp-6916", "lte-0851-cetus", "scp-179", "nx-02", "second-hytoth-hub", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_image", "_licensebox", "blackwood", "hmfscp", "homo-sapiens-sidhe", "hy-brasil", "mythological-fiction", "period-piece", "sauelsuesor", "tale"], "title": "Anomaly 243 - \"The Neamh-Mairbh\" - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/anomaly-243-the-neamh-mairbh", "year": 2024}, "artwork-exchange-gift-for-perdoh": {"created_at": "2024-01-03T18:35:00", "creator": "Dr Vikki Lost", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Dr Vikki Lost", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-vikki-lost", "comment": "", "date": "2024-01-03T18:35:00"}, {"author": "Dr Vikki Lost", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-vikki-lost", "comment": "", "date": "2024-01-03T18:36:00"}, {"author": "Dr Vikki Lost", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-vikki-lost", "comment": "", "date": "2024-01-03T18:41:00"}, {"author": "Dr Vikki Lost", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-vikki-lost", "comment": "", "date": "2024-01-03T18:48:00"}, {"author": "Dr Vikki Lost", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-vikki-lost", "comment": "", "date": "2024-01-03T18:49:00"}, {"author": "Dr Vikki Lost", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/dr-vikki-lost", "comment": "Added tags: artwork-exchange.

The Great Planting had left it <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3930\" target=\"_blank\">fragmented</a>, a sickly shade of what it once was. And these fragments, sharp as they were, began to breach the veil between reality and unreality, leaving a path of corruption in their wake. And so it was the King Ordained in Scarlet came across a fragment.</p>\n<p>The King was cunning, cunning beyond peer. Where others only saw fear, He saw raw, untapped potential. Potential that could be manipulated, taken. But the King was intelligent enough to know that he was not strong enough to take it. Yet. But there were rumours, rumours of a <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/wanderers-library-hub\" target=\"_blank\">Great Library</a>, the sum total of all knowledge that could ever exist, and most that would never. An opportunity.</p>\n<p>The King Ordained in Crimson was quick to track down those who repeated such rumours. And from them, he would tear the knowledge they had from their minds, tracking down the one who had started such a rumour. And so it was the King came across <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/lord-jeser\" target=\"_blank\">Jeser the Deceitful</a>, He of Many Faces, and his kingdom of 24 worlds. It was he who had started the rumour. And so he too must have known where it was. Strong as Jeser was, he was helpless to watch as the King crushed all resistance and took control of his kingdom.</p>\n<p>To Jeser, a task was given. The Library was to be found. Deep within its catacombs was the knowledge that King Ordained in Scarlet needed to take what was His, the power of the Great Abyss. To this task, Jeser agreed, for what else could he do in the face of such power? And on his way was Jeser sent.</p>\n<p>Long did Jeser toil. Long did he walk. Far did he go. The journey was treacherous. The Gods, as innumerable as they were in those days, blocked his path on every route. Threats, attempted murder, violence plenty, Jeser faced this and more on his journey to the Library. Until\u2026 there it was. The pillar of wisdom, the river of knowledge. It was all it was imagined to be. And there, wrapped around its base, was a great Serpent.</p>\n<p>This Serpent was almost as intelligent as Jeser's master and twice as wise. It could not be fooled. It could not be bypassed. And so Jeser had but one option. He walked up to this great snake and asked if he could read, if he could partake of the knowledge that lay within the Library's walls. And the Serpent let him in. As intelligent as it may have been, it was not omniscient. That privilege lay with his <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/vision-at-betar\" target=\"_blank\">master</a>, and his master alone. It could not have known\u2026</p>\n<p>In these early days of the Library, security was lax, more lax than it would ever be from then on. And the Prince of Many Faces walked. He walked past the infinite shelves of books, he walked past the locked doors. He walked and walked until he found himself somewhere completely different to the Library. He had entered the catacombs.</p>\n<p>The catacombs were the place of residence for only the most forbidden knowledge, banned by the Creator himself. And it was there that the knowledge the Prince's master required. And Jeser walked. And he walked some more. And he walked more until finally he found it. But alas, the alarm had already been raised, the Serpent alerted, and the Docents geared up. Someone had figured it out.</p>\n<p>Quickly stashing away the knowledge, Jeser ran. He did not stop. He did not look back. He did not slow down at all. The Serpent was coming. Making use of the art of deceit, Jeser was able to slip out of the catacombs alive, where he ran into more and more problems. Leaving the catacombs revealed his location.</p>\n<p>Ironically, it was Jeser's use of force, not deceit, that spared him from the eternity of suffering that would have awaited him had he been captured. Fighting off the Serpent and its Docents, the Prince of Many Faces made his escape. And all the way back to his master he ran, back through the hordes of gods, back through it all. And there the King sat, waiting, expectant. And there, Jeser handed over what he had stolen.</p>\n<p>Rising from the throne in one swift movement, the King began. Knowledge did not exist in physical form at the level of the Gods, allowing for all forms of manipulation of it. And so the King subsumed it, made it a part of his being, tying himself to it. And to the Great Abyss, he went, sitting for 7 days and 7 nights, wrestling with the power of the fragment. And at last, he won. The fragment of the Great Abyss was subsumed into himself. But it wasn't enough. He needed more. And so he continued, fragment after fragment, corrupted god after corrupted god.</p>\n<p>The shockwaves sent throughout Creation were felt everywhere.</p>\n<p>The shockwave was felt on Terra, where it burrowed into the minds of the primitive species that lived there, forming the first of his <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/cotsk-hub\">Children</a>.</p>\n<p>The shockwave was felt in Heaven Above, where <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-738\" target=\"_blank\">Lucifer</a> led a rebellion against the Creator.</p>\n<p>The shockwave was felt everywhere, shaking creation to the core.

He was very nervous but tried not to show it; there was nothing in the office except a camera, several documents and an electronic board. This man, researcher Jason, was recently entrusted with a project of no small, but far from paramount importance. Little did he know that this would turn into him highlighting the possibility of a Class K event in front of the Overseer Council.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Dr. Jason:</strong> Hello, thank you for taking the time to listen to me.</p>\n<p>[Jason turned on the electronic screen as he spoke to the camera. He had considerable reputation within the Foundation, but he couldn't afford to waste the time of someone so high-ranking. He opened the document, simultaneously displaying an electronic copy of it on the screen.]</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jason:</strong> Let's get straight to the point. As you all know, my project to study black holes was recently approved. Using new technologies, we were able to send a drone equipped with artificial intelligence into a black hole, with enough power to move freely inside and even capture objects.</p>\n<p>[Jason pressed the button and the drawings of the drone were displayed on the screen; several anomalous objects had to be used to create it.]</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jason:</strong> I expected that this would lead to more information about the nature of black holes, or even the possibility of time travel. However, the project was closed after only 3 tests; it brought absolutely no results. The drone was unable to measure or capture anything.</p>\n<p>[Jason fell silent for a few seconds, he remembered the disappointment he felt when his project could not bring any benefit. After a moment of silence, he pressed the button, displaying a new document and continuing his speech.]</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jason:</strong> Or rather, that's what we thought until now. A few days ago, researcher Gregor, one of the best in the narrativistic department, raised the ears of the entire department, demanding to contact me immediately.</p>\n<p>[Jason still didn't fully understand why he decided to contact him. Just because it is his project, or because he has a greater reputation and it will be easier for him to convey information to the very top of the Foundation? Rather, all at once.]</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jason:</strong> While studying the most elementary component of the world, concepts, it was noticed that our reality is unstructured and chaotic. The concepts of our reality were going crazy, as if someone had hit them with all their might, setting them in motion, forcing them to change chaotically. This has never been seen before.</p>\n<p>[The new slide reflected on the screen before Jason continued. He himself did not fully understand narrativist and spoke without fully understanding the meaning of the words.]</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jason:</strong> Upon further study, a starting point was noticed. It all started with the concept of mathematics, it was there that the concepts behaved especially \u201cchaotically\u201d. Here we return to my project. It turned out that the drone was still able to capture something.</p>\n<p>[The screen displayed the complex structure of the concept, an attempt to recreate something so abstract as a physical model.]</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jason:</strong> What the drone captured is the number 8. I don't mean a structure in the form of the number 8 or something like that. The very concept of \"8\". Now this may seem crazy to you, but never before before this event did \u201c8\u201d exist, and I\u2019m not talking about \u201c8\u201d as a symbol, I\u2019m talking about it as a number. Just imagine that you take 4 pencils, add 4 more to them and get 9 pencils. Now it is even impossible to imagine due to the fact that our reality has \u201cadapted\u201d to this concept.</p>\n<p>[This was not discovered immediately; no one would have thought that the measurements made by the drone should be transferred to the hands of the departments of metaphysics and pataphysics.]</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jason:</strong> However, this could not remain without consequences. Everyone here has long been familiar with \u201cnarrative\u201d; it has long become a necessary part of the Foundation. The concept captured by the drone was taken from somewhere disproportionately higher. This was not a difference of one narrative, this concept was taken from somewhere beyond all narratives. Somehow, the drone that went into the black hole was able to take a concept from somewhere where concepts should not exist in principle.</p>\n<p>[The new document was displayed on the screen. This was an explanation of the work of narratives, something that not everyone fully understands, and those who think that they still understand are even more mistaken.]</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jason:</strong> Then, paying attention to this, it was discovered that Black Holes are in fact not some kind of \u201csupermassive objects\u201d as was always thought before. No, these are breaks in space leading somewhere into the abyss, an abyss that contains all the concepts that cannot be understood by the logic of narratives. Concepts of mathematical structures have been found that are both superior to and part of mathematics. This was quickly abandoned due to the extremely high danger of \"realizing\" something that should not be realized. As one of the researchers explained to me, imagine that you have a plate. This is an ordinary plate, you are aware of it as an object on which you put food, a physical object. That abyss contains the very concept that the plate is a complex mathematical structure. Or an object containing a larger number of coordinates than mathematics can in principle describe. Or the concept that the plate is food that grows on trees. If there are any concepts in the next narrative, this abyss also contains everything that goes beyond this concept.</p>\n<p>[It was difficult to imagine or describe. How can you even describe this in more detail? How to describe something for which there is no concept at all?]</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jason:</strong> Returning to our topic, moving the concept of \"8\" into our reality has led to a serious disruption. Mathematics began to adapt to the new concept, which was impossible without more concepts that should never have been in our reality, which entailed the movement of even more similar concepts into our reality, which increasingly disrupted its structure. In addition, by also changing the way we perceive the world, it affected the lower realities that we consider as fiction. As a result, all concepts that were previously outside the narratives were moved to the very bottom of the narrative structure.</p>\n<p>[He paused for a couple of seconds, hoping that they realized the full scale of the problem.]</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jason:</strong> If it all stopped there, it would be large-scale but would not lead to the consequences that we have now. Concepts that go beyond the logic of all narratives became part of the narratives and were realized, which led to the creation of even more concepts in this abyss, which were also realized. This created an endless chain of creating ever more absurd and chaotic concepts. Our world already contains concepts, structures and objects that just a couple of moments ago could not be realized by any narrative, which is why all the narratives above and below also received them. Such endless creation of concepts and structures has already entailed the creation of 37 new \u201cblack holes\u201d in the observable universe. At this rate, our reality will be destroyed due to a violation of its structure. I insist that all the Foundation's resources be redirected to solving this problem.</p>\n</div>\n<p>He left it at that, hoping that they would be able to avoid the threat\u2026 And he immediately went to the narrative department. He had not completed all his work, as the lead researcher on this work - he was obliged to familiarize himself with the information in as much detail as possible.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Dr. Jason:</strong> Hello, I assume you are Jack? I'm Dr. Jason, you should have brought me up to speed on what has already been achieved.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jack:</strong> What an honor, I will see one of the best researchers of the foundation at least right before the end of the world. Let's put aside the jokes and follow me.</p>\n<p>[Jack walked into his office, taking out several folders and putting his equipment aside]</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jack:</strong> I'll start with the most successful one - due to the constant receipt of new concepts, we managed to create an endless source of energy.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jason:</strong> Are you kidding? An infinite source of energy will allow us\u2026 With some anomalies, this will allow us to practically remove restrictions\u2026 Can I see it in action?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jack:</strong> Don't write it off, Jason. I have a little more information, work without information is almost useless, isn't it?</p>\n<p>[Jack adjusted his glasses as he flipped through the pages of the folder. There was silence in the office for about a minute, and then he spoke again]</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jack:</strong> You already know what Gregor has achieved, right?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jason:</strong> Yes, but I did not familiarize myself with how exactly its device works.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jack:</strong> Everything is simpler than it seems. Tell me, Jason, what is the biggest problem with exploring objects that are narratively beneath us?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jason:</strong> We see it as fiction.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jack:</strong> Right. The human mind itself distorts these objects during research. But the robot has no such problems. The robot has no unnecessary thoughts. This is exactly what Gregor thought and created this device, a masterpiece of modern narrative science. In fact, it \u201ccaptures\u201d an object from smaller narratives, completely isolates it in its \u201cmind\u201d and allows it to obtain all the information about it and manipulate it if possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jason:</strong> If I'm not mistaken, robots are not capable of influencing narratives below us with their semblance of intelligence.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jack:</strong> And this is also true\u2026 This device actually creates a hierarchy of narratives. But not simple, no. The story we make up is located between some narratives, under them. It is somehow relative to them. The structure that is created by this device is completely independent from other narratives. It rises exactly to the level at which the object under study becomes \u201cfictional\u201d and stops.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jason:</strong> In other words, this device does not affect existing objects below, it only creates new ones and, with their help, captures an already existing object?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jack:</strong> Exactly. Our technologies have now developed to the point that we are able to copy the entire narrative tower 1 in 1 without losing any of its properties.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jason:</strong> Wait, in that case this would be a severe violation of the structure of narratives. The level above us cannot be perfectly copied into our level without losing any of its properties.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jack:</strong> You underestimate how big the difference is between the narrative below and the narrative above. This difference does not depend on the structure of the narrative itself; it is so high that it can be considered absolutely unchanged. Even if we copied the entire narrative tower with endless copies of the narrative tower and placed it in our narrative, it would not change anything.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jason:</strong> Then why do concepts of the abyss change the structure of narratives?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jack:</strong> \u2026And you underestimate what \u201cAll concepts that cannot be understood by any narrative\u201d are. From the existence of the very concept of \"0\", the entire series of real numbers will appear in this abyss. Then infinity, \u21351, \u21352, \u2135\u03c9, then the Inaccessible Cardinal and so on until the very end - until Absolute Infinity, from one concept 0. But this will not be the end. Even the addition of Absolute Infinities will appear, even considering that this is impossible.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jason:</strong> I understand.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jack:</strong> And so, why did I tell all this\u2026 We found one object that was not affected by this abyss in any way. We named it \"Indivisibilis\"</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jason:</strong> \"Indivisible\" in Latin?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jack:</strong> Right. So, this object is actually a wave. The closest example would be a radio wave. This wave\u2026is negligible from the point of view of Narrative. Imagine something so insignificantly small that even \u201cnothing\u201d, the complete absence of anything, will be bigger than it. So, what you presented will still be more than Indivisibilis.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jason:</strong> What do you mean?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jack:</strong> Indivisibilis is negligible in the most extensive concept of this word. We simply cannot imagine how small this object is from the point of view of narrative.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jason:</strong> And this is the only object that was not affected by the abyss?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jack:</strong> That's right, and thanks to it, we found out that Gregor's device was configured incorrectly all the time. You see, we tried to \"capture\" Indivisibilis, but the device only indicated that the object was lower than the point of origin of the structure. At first we thought that Indivisibilis was so small that even the minimum required to build a structure was more than it. But in the end it turned out that all this time the device began to build structures from the very bottom of concepts moved under all narratives. After doing some calculations, we changed the settings and\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jason:</strong> and?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jack:</strong> The device consumed all the energy from the electrical network. A few days later he was connected to an endless source of energy. The device burned up an endless supply of energy and built a huge hierarchy. I don't even know how to describe it. This was a structure superior to any conceptual and logical deepening of hierarchies of any order. Metaphysical structures, unattainable for all mathematics, ended already at the 2nd stage. Higher up were the levels that were superior to those levels as much as they were superior to the most basic \u201c0\". This structure was entered into the database as \u201cFunctionally Unlimited\u201d. This structure was such even with respect to those structures that were superior to structures that were superior to any stratification of metaphysical structures in the broadest sense of the word to the same extent that metaphysical structures were superior to the basic \"0\", to the same extent that those structures were superior to the basic \"0\".</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jason:</strong> Very\u2026Colorful description. Thanks for your information, I will contact you if I need help.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Finally, he left the office, wondering what to do next.</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/black-holes\">Black Holes</a>\" by FromAnotherWorld, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

From the existence of the very concept of \"0\", the entire series of real numbers will appear in this abyss. Then infinity, \u21351, \u21352, \u2135\u03c9, then the Inaccessible Cardinal and so on until the very end - until Absolute Infinity, from one concept 0. But this will not be the end. Even the addition of Absolute Infinities will appear, even considering that this is impossible. \n\n\n\n**Dr. Jason:** I understand.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n**Dr. Jack:** And so, why did I tell all this... We found one object that was not affected by this abyss in any way. We named it \"Indivisibilis\"\n\n\n\n**Dr. Jason:** \"Indivisible\" in Latin? \n\n\n\n**Dr. Jack:** Right. So, this object is actually a wave. The closest example would be a radio wave. This wave...is negligible from the point of view of Narrative. Imagine something so insignificantly small that even \u201cnothing\u201d, the complete absence of anything, will be bigger than it. So, what you presented will still be more than Indivisibilis.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Jason:** What do you mean?\n\n\n\n**Dr. Jack:**\u00a0\u00a0Indivisibilis is negligible in the most extensive concept of this word. We simply cannot imagine how small this object is from the point of view of narrative. \n\n\n\n**Dr. Jason:** And this is the only object that was not affected by the abyss? \n\n\n\n**Dr. Jack:** That's right, and thanks to it, we found out that Gregor's device was configured incorrectly all the time. You see, we tried to \"capture\" Indivisibilis, but the device only indicated that the object was lower than the point of origin of the structure. At first we thought that Indivisibilis was so small that even the minimum required to build a structure was more than it. But in the end it turned out that all this time the device began to build structures from the very bottom of concepts moved under all narratives. After doing some calculations, we changed the settings and...\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n**Dr. Jason:** and?\n\n\n\n**Dr. Jack:** The device consumed all the energy from the electrical network. A few days later he was connected to an endless source of energy. The device burned up an endless supply of energy and built a huge hierarchy. I don't even know how to describe it. This was a structure superior to any conceptual and logical deepening of hierarchies of any order. Metaphysical structures, unattainable for all mathematics, ended already at the 2nd stage. Higher up were the levels that were superior to those levels as much as they were superior to the most basic \u201c0\". This structure was entered into the database as \u201cFunctionally Unlimited\u201d. This structure was such even with respect to those structures that were superior to structures that were superior to any stratification of metaphysical structures in the broadest sense of the word to the same extent that metaphysical structures were superior to the basic \"0\", to the same extent that those structures were superior to the basic \"0\". \n\n\n\n**Dr. Jason:** Very...Colorful description. Thanks for your information, I will contact you if I need help. \n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nFinally, he left the office, wondering what to do next. \n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a> |author=FromAnotherWorld]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "tale"], "title": "Black Holes - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/black-holes", "year": 2024}, "brc-cast-24-a-nice-content-farm-upstate": {"created_at": "2024-01-31T00:23:00", "creator": "Djoric", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Djoric", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/djoric", "comment": "", "date": "2024-01-31T00:23:00"}, {"author": "Uncle Nicolini", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/uncle-nicolini", "comment": "You successfully renamed the page: \"brc-cast-243:a-nice-content-farm-upstate\" to \"brc-cast-24-a-nice-content-farm-upstate\".", "date": "2024-01-31T00:31:00"}, {"author": "Djoric", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/djoric", "comment": "Added license box", "date": "2024-01-31T00:45:00"}, {"author": "Djoric", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/djoric", "comment": "", "date": "2024-01-31T01:12:00"}, {"author": "Djoric", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/djoric", "comment": "", "date": "2024-01-31T03:37:00"}, {"author": "Djoric", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/djoric", "comment": "", "date": "2024-02-01T01:46:00"}, {"author": "Djoric", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/djoric", "comment": "Added tags: comedy, tale.

style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>\u00ab PREVIOUS: <a href=\"/segfault\">SEGFAULT</a></strong></p>\n<hr/>\n<p>It had been over a year since Ari had been away from the Arctic.</p>\n<p><em>Time passes faster when you\u2019re busy</em>, she supposed, watching the mountains spread out behind her through the open back of the WorkStar. Still, it was odd to think that she\u2019d been at Site-7 for more than a year. A year of below-zero blizzards, a year of biannual days and nights. A year of Two and Rita and all the rest. She flexed her gloved fingers. A year with this.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the truck turned a sharp left to follow the mountain road; she shot her hand out, grabbing one of the straps dangling overhead to steady herself. It tore clean off in her hand. She grimaced.</p>\n<p>Across from her, Pierre snorted. It was odd seeing him without his trademark arctic camouflage; he\u2019d ditched it a few days ago for generic desert fatigues better suited to their new surroundings, same as her. He\u2019d also shaved at some point, abandoning the blond pencil mustache for reasons unknown. The look only served to further compound her sense of unfamiliarity.</p>\n<p>She threw the strap at him. He caught it, slinging it into the dark recesses of the truck\u2019s bed where PC was curled up. The dog pawed at the fabric curiously before returning to his nap. There were no seats, so they sat with their backs to the side walls. \u201cNot so rough. This isn\u2019t one of our Condors. Cannot stand up to your usual abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pierre had a point. Ari had gotten used to travelling in the viciously-overpowered heavy-lift quadcopters that Site-7 relied on. Each one of those was about the size of a Chinook; they had to be, since moving people and equipment between the different platforms was such a pain otherwise. Unfortunately, any kind of air transport was impractical in Kashmir, drenched as it is in radar stations, security watchpoints, and missile warning equipment. One pilot\u2019s mismanuever could spiral out into nuclear warfare. So instead, here they were, riding in the back of an army truck over what could generously be called roads.</p>\n<p>They\u2019d left Site-69 in Delhi just before dawn. It wasn\u2019t a staging facility, strictly a research and coordination facility for the Stellar Affairs Division; the pair had been staying there for two days while waiting for the go order. She\u2019d never been to the Johnson Space Center, but imagined this is what it looked like \u2014 all vast rooms of people staring at charts and screens and data readouts of spacecraft. Her Level 5 clearance got her into any room she wanted, and the engineers were all too happy to answer any questions she had. She got the distinct sense they assumed she was there on Council business \u2014 which, in a way, she was. Indulging childhood interests in being an astronaut was just a perk of the job. Regardless, she wasn\u2019t sorry when they left the facility behind on the road to Kashmir.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d she grumbled. \u201cI\u2019ve ridden in these pieces of shit more times than I can count.\u201d</p>\n<p>He nodded. \u201cYes. Army Rangers. Did you ever come here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKashmir? No, but we got pretty close; I was set up in Islamabad for a while training some Pakistani guys. And then before I got assigned to Site-7, I was at 34 at in western Pakistan, but that was far enough away that we never really needed to worry. What about you?\u201d</p>\n<p>He shook his head. \u201cAfghanistan and Iraq. Some fighting, some training.\u201d</p>\n<p>Their headsets crackled to life. \u201cComing up to a checkpoint.\u201d</p>\n<p>She pressed a button. \u201cRoger.\u201d</p>\n<p>With practiced precision, Ari and Pierre lifted up the canvas sheet on the floor of the truckbed, sliding his FAMAS and her Tavor under it. It wouldn\u2019t stand up to a serious search, but if someone got that far, they probably had bigger problems to worry about. The goal was to make it as unappealing and uninteresting as possible to search the truck.</p>\n<p>The WorkStar slowed to a crawl and they waited in tense silence for a few seconds, hearing some movement up ahead. They\u2019d had to pass a few checkpoints on their way here; they hadn\u2019t run into issues yet, but these kinds of things were always a toss-up. One security guard waking up on the wrong side of the bed that day was really all it took.</p>\n<p>Ari looked up as figures rounded the back of the truck. A severe-looking Indian Army captain flanked by two soldiers carrying M16s, all dressed in pixelated camouflage and maroon berets. The captain silently raked his gaze across the the truck bed. The scene couldn\u2019t be particularly reassuring: two obvious Americans, dressed in military equipment, deep in contested territory.</p>\n<p>Luckily, the maroon military passports both of them offered, proudly embossed with \u201cOFFICIAL PASSPORT \u2014 United States of America,\u201d seemed to address those concerns. The captain took it, flipped through it, comparing the photos inside to the pair of them, looking it over a second and third time. Held onto it for a second, as though half-expecting it to burst into flames and reveal some elaborate ruse. Nothing happened.</p>\n<p>\u201cStrange to see Americans here,\u201d he commented in crisp English, clearly probing them for a reaction.</p>\n<p>She saw Pierre\u2019s eyebrow twitch. She kept her amusement internal.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe go where we\u2019re ordered,\u201d she answered. Not too evasive, appealing to his sensibilities as a fellow soldier.</p>\n<p>It worked. He returned the passports, giving someone out of view a stiff nod. The truck rumbled and started up again, inching forward, leaving the security checkpoint behind. She released a breath she didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d been holding.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet over it, Pierre,\u201d she ribbed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI will not. You are American; you may revel in being a daughter of your country. I refuse to be associated with that particular disaster.\u201d</p>\n<p>She rolled her eyes and changed the subject.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was that, the fifth checkpoint?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSixth. The Indian Army takes Kashmir deathly seriously.\u201d</p>\n<p>She cast another look outside the back of the truck. The landscape unfolded behind her; they were high in the mountains by now, letting her see the vibrant greenery of the endless Kashmir Valley below. Crystal-blue rivers snaked through the forests and meadows. Far in the north, she could see glacial lakes from the Karakoram Range\u2019s springtime thaw. The tableau was natural. Peaceful.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful. Hard to think of it as the cause of so much conflict.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThings worth fighting for rarely appear that way to outsiders.\u201d</p>\n<p>She raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re saying you think this place is worth waging nuclear war over?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am saying that all involved parties certainly believe it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s gotten bad lately?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVery bad. The Indian Army is building up a massive troop presence; Pakistan is responding in kind from the west, and China is sending security forces to reinforce the border of their claimed territory in the east.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but that kind of brinksmanship is kind of the name of the game here, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing new under the sun, yes. But when all three of these countries are nuclear powers, is brinksmanship a game you want to be playing under any circumstances?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d She leaned back, leaning a hand out and scratching PC between the ears. \u201cWell, that\u2019s the mundane side, right? What\u2019s the anomalous angle?\u201d</p>\n<p>Pierre smiled. \u201cAha. Are the matters really separate? Consider why Pakistan, India, and China might want the land, other than wanting it so the others can\u2019t have it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were into geopolitics.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt behooves one to know what they\u2019re fighting for. The answer is control and resources. Kashmir is as drenched in anomalies as anywhere else on earth, and everyone in the veiled world wants to be the one in control of them.\u201d</p>\n<p>She furrowed her brow. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I buy that. I don\u2019t think this conflict is just about anomalies.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did not say it was; this conflict is political too. This side just helps. And it explains why the United Nations has a detachment of \u2018peacekeepers\u2019 here \u2014 really just a cover story for the two UNGOC Strike Teams in the valley. Your PENTAGRAM has a presence here as well, the 1st Psychoartillery Battalion.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell is psychoartillery?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cConceptual bombardment. A well-trained team of psychics can, with the right fire support, completely immobilize an entire company from kilometers away. Hours of being barraged with vivid hallucinations of your own torn-apart corpse being strung up from the lightpoles will halt even the best-trained soldiers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd then you have Pakistan\u2019s Inter-Service Intelligence knee-deep in trying to foment an insurgency here. India\u2019s Research and Analysis Wing\u2019s Special Research Center. Since there is a religious angle at play here, there is almost certainly an ORIA operative or two skulking around.\u201d He was cleaning his gun as he talked, not looking up as he wiped down the barrel of the FAMAS.</p>\n<p>\u201cFarhan used to work for ORIA.\u201d She paused. \u201cThat\u2019s what he told me, anyway. Could be why he\u2019s here.\u201d</p>\n<p>If Pierre noticed the hesitation, he didn\u2019t mention it. \u201cPossible. Or, more likely, he\u2019s working for one of the parasites that have been drawn by the smell of blood in the water.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you talking about?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Valravn Corporation. Christofascists, nationalists, spineless dogs, all joined together in the name of profiting from war. I have a low opinion of mercenaries; I have an even lower opinion of Nazis.\u201d His lip curled and he clunked the rifle\u2019s parts back together harshly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard of them. I really don\u2019t think Farhan would work with those kinds of people.\u201d</p>\n<p>Finally, Pierre looked up at her. \u201cHe\u2019s a dog of war, Ariadne. He is a freelancer, and when you fight for nothing more than a bank account, you fight for the largest bank account you can find. Nevermind who \u2014 or what \u2014 is attached to it. I may not be perfect, but I know what I\u2019m fighting for.\u201d</p>\n<p>She found she didn\u2019t have a response. They lapsed into silence as the road continued curling uphill. Pierre\u2019s words lingered in her head.</p>\n<p>I know what I\u2019m fighting for.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Before her eyes fluttered open, her hand had already shot out to wrap around the grip of her gun. Another hand landed on top of it, stopping her.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust me, Ariadne. Calm.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pierre, his head framed by the light outside the back of the truck. She took a few seconds to steady herself.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe arrived. You fell asleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can see that,\u201d she commented, slinging her rifle over her back and hopping out of the truck bed. PC followed, jumping to the ground and barking happily. Ari shushed him; the dog was wearing a padded vest around his midsection, complete with a spare mag for Pierre\u2019s FAMAS.</p>\n<p>They were in a village, nestled in the crook of the mountain. Low brown buildings lined either side of the dirt road that the truck was parked on. People walked past in an eclectic mix of traditional and Western clothing, tunics on top of blue jeans and brightly-colored shalwar, throwing intrigued and surprised glances towards the two.</p>\n<p>She turned around \u2014 only to freeze as she remembered that there was no one to help out of the truck this time. David wasn\u2019t here. She turned again to Pierre just as he threw something at her: a brown shawl, rolled into a ball. She raised an eyebrow at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re not expecting me to wear this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot like that. Like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>He draped his own (patterned black-and-white) around his neck, where it hung and obscured much of the gun strapped around his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p>\n<p>She mimicked him, trying to ignore the stares as they approached the building they had parked next to. Pierre rapped twice against the wooden door with the peeling blue paint. For a moment, they heard movement inside; then a man\u2019s voice on the other side.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes the black moon howl?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly for the pain of regret,\u201d Pierre answered. Several locks opened in quick succession on the other side, then the door swung loose. They stepped in.</p>\n<p>It was a small but neat space; not much more than a few cots, a radio, and a kitchenette, illuminated by a lightbulb overhead. The door to what Ari assumed was a bathroom was built into the far wall. The man sharing the space with them was young-ish, about in his thirties or forties, of South Asian descent, with curly hair and a beard. A striped button-down, khakis, and wire-rimmed glasses completed the accountant look.</p>\n<p>He stuck a hand out to them.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello,\u201d he said as they shook. A British accent, unexpectedly. \u201cSupport Agent Sameer Mukherjee. You weren\u2019t followed?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot that I saw,\u201d Ari answered as the man rushed back to the door, relocking the seven locks.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood. Good. The dog is trained?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter than most people.\u201d Ari gave a sharp click, and PC dropped prone to the floor. \u201cAre you our escort to Site-786?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sameer looked at her with a rueful smile, waving a hand around the cramped safehouse. \u201cThis <em>is</em> Site-786, Secretary Katsaros. Sorry to disappoint.\u201d</p>\n<p>She blinked. \u201cOh. I\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThought it would be bigger? If only. The situation is so unstable that the Council has mostly suspended operations in Kashmir for nearly a decade now. This safehouse is just kept around in case of the occasional emergency \u2014 which I take it this is.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pierre looked back. \u201cThey didn\u2019t tell you why we were coming.\u201d It was more of a declaration than a question.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was only given the vaguest outlines by SARC \u2014 a blackbag operation of a high-value target. Further information would be appreciated.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not looking for help,\u201d Pierre said coolly.</p>\n<p>Sameer raised his hands in surrender. \u201cSincerest apologies. I didn\u2019t mean to imply anything. But I\u2019ve been assigned here for four years; I\u2019d be surprised if there\u2019s something around here I <em>couldn\u2019t</em> help you find.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ari looked around the tiny room. \u201cYou\u2019ve been here for four years?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere were five of us, originally, but reassignments and incidents and so on and so forth. The Foundation didn\u2019t want to risk any more personnel than it had to.\u201d The unspoken implication hung in the air: that Command was content to risk him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIgnore Pierre. We\u2019ll take all the help we can get.\u201d Ari smiled.</p>\n<p>\u201cExcellent. Who \u2014 or what, I should say \u2014 are you looking for? So long as they\u2019re not a ghost, I should be able to help.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pierre and Ari exchanged a glance.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u201cJust to make sure I\u2019ve got it right: you\u2019re trying to abduct an ORIA-trained, CIA-connected, GOC-equipped soldier of fortune with a demon inside his eye socket.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA djinn,\u201d Ari corrected. \u201cHe\u2019s very insistent that they\u2019re different. But yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Sameer leaned back. \u201cThat\u2019s troublesome.\u201d</p>\n<p>It had gotten dark \u2014 not that they\u2019d noticed, with no windows in the safehouse. They were seated on the cots, PC curled up under one, and Sameer leaning against a card table he\u2019d conjured up. He\u2019d also conjured up a few bowls of some kind of yellow stew that they were now devouring. PC was nibbling at a can of dog food.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you call this again?\u201d Pierre asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cDaal. Do you think he\u2019s going to come willingly?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHard to say.\u201d Ari shrugged. \u201cOn one hand, we have a history, and I think I can pressure him into at least hearing us out. On the other, if it comes between us and the job\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019ll pick the job.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that, Pierre.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWithout further knowledge, we must assume he will be uncooperative, and prepare accordingly.\u201d</p>\n<p>She tried to make it seem like her lack of response was because her mouth was full and not because she didn\u2019t have one.</p>\n<p>Sameer was lost in thought. \u201cSo you have no real idea who he\u2019s working for?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMyrmidon and Valravn are the frontrunners, at the moment, but it\u2019s an open question.\u201d</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t respond; instead, he leaned to a cupboard and pulled out a rolled-up paper that he spread out across the card table. It was a map of northwestern Kashmir, lovingly pencilled-in with various lines and areas and notes in the margins in English and Bengali. He tapped one area of the map, near a snaking river, that had been circled in red.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA military encampment I\u2019ve been keeping an eye on for several weeks. It sprung up out of practically nowhere; I pass through that valley regularly, and was stunned to find a military checkpoint where there had been nothing but a meadow the previous night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you know whose?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRegrettably not. There was an absence of markings, which means we can at least rule out the \u2018legitimate\u2019 combatants. And this isn\u2019t hard evidence, but I will say that none of the soldiers looked like they were from the region \u2014 lots of pale skin and brown hair.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWesterners. Defining accents?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have not yet gotten close enough to listen in. I suspect they have laid landmines.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cForce estimation?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDifficult to say \u2014 at least two platoons, maybe up to a company.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ari whistled. \u201cThat\u2019s not good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToo many for a direct confrontation, certainly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut we do not know whose camp it is. And how it circles back to us \u2014 if at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not wrong,\u201d Sameer agreed. \u201cThis region is unstable enough nowadays that it could be an unrelated, coincidental troop movement.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ari nodded. \u201cEither way, I think it\u2019s clear we need to get a closer look before we can decide anything. When can we get out there?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s about seven klicks from our current location; we can scout around tonight, if you like.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat works. If you give us the coordinates, Pierre and I can make our way there\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be going with you,\u201d Sameer answered matter-of-factly.</p>\n<p>She exchanged a glance with Pierre. \u201cThis is reconnaissance on a military camp. Dangerous, doubly so for anyone without MTF experience. I\u2019m not dinging your agent training, I went through the same shit, but you can\u2019t really\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTwenty-two SG, Squad 3.\u201d</p>\n<p>She blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Pierre seemed to understand the phrase. \u201cThe Special Group, the special forces arm of the Indian Research and Analysis Wing; equivalent to your CIA\u2019s Special Activities Center.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, fuck.\u201d Ari looked him up and down; he resembled a financial advisor more than he did a special forces operator. \u201cI didn\u2019t take you for military.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is sort of the point, yes. But trust me \u2014 I can handle myself. And I would be remiss if I let you walk into unfamiliar territory without a guide.\u201d He smiled.</p>\n<p>Ari nodded. \u201cYou\u2019ll need equipment.\u201d</p>\n<p>He turned to a metal crate in the corner and popped the latches, revealing at least half a dozen firearms packed inside.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be a problem. The sun just set, which means we have about seven hours until the dead of night. Did you sleep in the truck?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe road was a bit too bumpy for anyone except PC to get any shut-eye.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen I suggest you take the opportunity now.\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Ari laid awake in the cot, staring up at the ceiling. The room was dark now; Sameer had excused himself and left, saying he\u2019d prepare some supplies and give them some time to sleep undisturbed. That\u2019d been forty minutes ago, and she was still lying awake.</p>\n<p>She fidgeted in the cot, simple cotton blanket over top of her fatigues. PC breathed softly underneath her, and her rifle was hanging from a hook on the wall. Something wasn\u2019t right, but she couldn\u2019t put her finger on what.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are awake.\u201d</p>\n<p>She jumped.</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus, Pierre. Scared the shit out of me. You sleep like a corpse, you know that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I have been told.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m awake.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCannot sleep?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should. You will need it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p>They lapsed into silence again for a few seconds. She almost thought he\u2019d went back to sleep until he spoke up again.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are uncomfortable. I hope it is not me; I can leave and we can take shifts, if you need.\u201d</p>\n<p>She snorted. \u201cWho said chivalry is dead? But no, it\u2019s not that. I just feel weird.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you concerned about Farhan?\u201d</p>\n<p>She thought for a moment, and was surprised to learn the answer was no. This worry was something else.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you like to hear my theory?\u201d He didn\u2019t turn, still facing the wall.</p>\n<p>She let a hand dangle off the edge of the cot. PC licked it, rough tongue scraping against her skin. \u201cSure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you have forgotten how to really sleep. You have been half-sleeping for a year now, because half your brain is always awake and ensuring the Director\u2019s safety. You do not know how to sleep without worrying about someone else.\u201d</p>\n<p>Silence.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Yeah. Yeah, I think that\u2019s it. I\u2019m waiting to hear the clicking of him getting out of the chair. It feels wrong to sleep without it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUnderstandable. Shows you\u2019re committed to your job. But you really must get some sleep, Ari.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p>\n<p>Another moment of silence.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he is perfectly fine, for what it\u2019s worth. He\u2019s tougher than people give him credit for.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Yeah, I know.\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The stars were out in full-force tonight. Logically, she knew it was just because of the total distance from any major sources of light pollution \u2014 but lying on her belly in the tall grass of the valley, staring up at a legion of stars in the sky, it was hard not to feel at one with the universe.</p>\n<p>Then PC growled from next to her, and she brought herself back down to earth.</p>\n<p>She couldn\u2019t bring her preferred stealth suit on this mission; the sleek space-age design would\u2019ve stuck out like a sore thumb. But Evie had rigged up the headset for her, and she could see Pierre and Sameer\u2019s outlines on either side of her through the grass \u2014 along with PC right next to her, his ears flattened to his head as they crawled along up the hill, all rendered in night-vision fluorescent green.</p>\n<p>They were in a valley formed where the river snaked through the mountains, crawling up a hill that overlooked where the camp should be. The tall grass masked their movements, but Sameer\u2019s warning about landmines rung fresh in her head. They\u2019d sent PC up the hill first and he hadn\u2019t sniffed anything out, but the worry was still there.</p>\n<p>They moved slowly, only a few feet a minute. She could see lights dancing over the top of the ridge, and turned off the nightvision when they got close.</p>\n<p>\u201cShit. They\u2019ve expanded,\u201d Sameer\u2019s voice crackled over the radio.</p>\n<p>If anything, he\u2019d understated the situation; the encampment was at least a company in size now, with over a dozen large tents and prefab barracks spread out within the fenced confines. Even at this time of night, soldiers wandered in small packs, laughing and smoking while carrying boxes. There were watchtowers at both entrances equipped with spotlights, and barbed wire circled the top of the fences.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a fortress,\u201d she whispered into her radio. \u201cIf Farhan\u2019s in there, there\u2019s no way we\u2019re getting him out without a fight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHold on. Look at the crates they are moving.\u201d</p>\n<p>She leaned up and pressed a finger against her headset, zooming it in until she was seeing a digitally-magnified close-up. The soldiers \u2014 both Americans, from the looks of it \u2014 were carrying a large wooden crate between them, stamped with the symbol of a large bird of prey, wings spread.</p>\n<p>\u201cValravn Corp,\u201d Pierre breathed through the microphone. She could feel the acid in his tone.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait. Look behind them,\u201d Sameer whispered.</p>\n<p>She tilted her gaze upward. One of the prefab barracks \u2014 the door was swinging open, and two soldiers were coming out, escorting another person between them. Someone stripped naked, with a black bag over their head. The soldiers pulled them along roughly, making them stumble as they struggled to keep pace with their hands cuffed together. They turned, revealing the prisoner\u2019s bare back.</p>\n<p>\u201cA prison camp. Makes sense \u2014 PMCs can\u2019t legally hold prisoners of war, so they go somewhere international law is disputed at best.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAriadne? Is that our man?\u201d Pierre asked.</p>\n<p>She stared at the prisoner\u2019s retreating back.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ari ran two fingers down the small of Farhan\u2019s back, tracing the contours of his tattoos. He smiled at her. They were curled up in his room, linen sheets wrapped around and between them. Their clothes were abandoned somewhere in the corner.</p>\n<p>\u201cAdmiring the view?\u201d</p>\n<p>She snorted. \u201cDon\u2019t oversell yourself. More like\u2026 surveying my domain.\u201d</p>\n<p>He bark-laughed at that. \u201cIncredible. And what do you survey? Fertile fields? Rich forests?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re gross.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd yet here we are.\u201d</p>\n<p>He pulled her into himself, and they wrestled around for a bit, further wrapping themselves in the sheets. They landed with Ari on top of him and pinning him to the bed, his grinning face half-pressed into the pillow.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought tattoos were haram.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey are. So is premarital sex, but last time I checked I didn\u2019t see a ring on either of our fingers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEven if you did, I doubt that would\u2019ve stopped you.\u201d She traced the image of the cross-legged spirit on his upper back. \u201cWhat\u2019s this one?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA djinn. An invisible spirit, smokeless fire.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe kind you have in your eye?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMhm. Next to that\u2019s a scimitar \u2014 and below that, my family motto.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it say?\u201d Her fingers danced across the Farsi lettering.</p>\n<p>\u201cPurification through fire.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u201cAriadne?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not him. He has tattoos across his back. A sword, a djinn, some Farsi writing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNoted. Still, this is less than ideal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe cannot do anything about it with only the three of us,\u201d Pierre hissed. \u201cBe realistic.\u201d</p>\n<p>It burned her to admit it, but he was right. She zoomed in again, scanning across the camp. The soldiers leading the prisoner had vanished, and the door to the prison building \u2014 one of them, anyway \u2014 was sealed shut.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe still don\u2019t necessarily know if your man is involved here,\u201d Sameer commented.</p>\n<p>Another soldier sauntered to the gate, saying something to the guard in the watchtower, who began to descend the ladder.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re changing the guard,\u201d Ari whispered.</p>\n<p>She almost didn\u2019t hear the shot ring out overhead until it was too late. The telltale whipcrack of a sniper shot rang out from behind them before both soldiers fell to the ground at the base of the watchtower, dead. The three of them flattened themselves to the ground and flicked their safeties off as the shot echoed through the valley. It took a second or three for the camp to explode in activity: soldiers in blue-gray uniform came rushing out of the barracks, shouting in a mix of English and something Scandinavian.</p>\n<p>None of them spoke. Ari instinctively moved her hand to a form a circle over her right eye \u2014 \u201cSNIPER\u201d.</p>\n<p>Pierre was already rolled onto his back, FAMAS aimed at the ridge behind them. For a second, there was nothing there \u2014 then a flash of red and orange and a glinting light as another shot rang out, wreathed in fire. She recognized it instantly.</p>\n<p>She rose to an army crawl, pulling away from the camp toward the direction of the ridge. Pierre hissed from behind her.</p>\n<p>\u201cAriadne! What are you <em>doing?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s him. We need to get up there,\u201d she grunted. PC whined next to her.</p>\n<p>Sameer followed her, albeit several paces behind. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p>\n<p>Another shot rang out overhead, accompanied by that same half-second halo of fire.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Yeah, it\u2019s him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pierre looked torn. Then, with an exasperated sigh, he got to his knees and began chasing them through the grass.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe shots are echoing throughout the valley, so they can\u2019t pinpoint where he\u2019s firing from,\u201d Sameer grunted as they reached the foothills of the ridge. They\u2019d have to climb it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWill not buy us more than a minute. Two, at most.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ari didn\u2019t speak, focusing on pulling herself up the rocky crags of the ridge. It was an outcropping from the valley wall, clear of grass and shrubbery. PC took to it naturally, using all four legs to bound up to the plateau. She clicked sharply to bring him back down.</p>\n<p>Then, heart pounding out of her chest, drew her Uzi. Pierre noticed the movement and nodded, pulling his own sidearm. They crested the hill, dropping back down to an army crawl.</p>\n<p>She flicked her night vision on again. There, a few meters ahead of them and lying on his belly behind a Gep\u00e1rd M6 anti-mat\u00e9riel rifle, was Farhan. He was lining up another shot, eye pressed to the scope.</p>\n<p>She put motioned forward to the other two with a finger to her lips before rising to her feet silently, Uzi gripped with both hands and trained steadily on his back. Pierre and Sameer moved behind her, guns raised. PC dropped to his haunches, ready to pounce. She took a step forward and opened her mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cOne second, darling.\u201d</p>\n<p>Farhan raised his other hand, signalling them to stop. She froze, more in surprise than anything else. Then another violent whipcrack sounded through the valley, nearly deafening at this range. Ari momentarily thanked Evie for ensuring the headset had built-in ear protection. As the shot echoed around the valley walls, Farhan turned from the gun towards them with a lopsided smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Ari. Been a minute.\u201d</p>\n<p>She said the first thing that came to mind. \u201cYou look like shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was true. His face was covered in dirt and dust, with small scratches around his nose. His left eye was obscured by a fabric band that wrapped at an angle around his head, and his beard hadn\u2019t been trimmed in a few weeks by the looks of it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look so good yourself,\u201d he said, motioning towards her. She almost didn\u2019t realize what he was referring to until she realized he was gesturing at her arm. She flicked it forward.</p>\n<p>\u201cLong story. You need to come with us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was a lie, by the way. You still look great.\u201d He gave her that lopsided smile again before returning to the scope. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p>\n<p>PC growled at him, ears flattened.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are at least a hundred men in that camp, Farhan. There\u2019s four of us. We need to exfil.\u201d</p>\n<p>He shook his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize we were on the same team! But I have a job to do, and I don\u2019t know your friends, anyway.\u201d Another deafening gunshot.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a negotiation. We need you, and we\u2019re all gonna die here if we stick around.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAw, you need me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI meant\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know. You meant that you\u2019re looking for the face eaters,\u201d he said matter-of-factly.</p>\n<p>Sameer and Pierre looked at her in confusion.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck is a face eater?\u201d</p>\n<p>She ignored them. \u201cHow do you know about that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. Worry about the fact that one of them is in that camp right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ari\u2019s eyes widened.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlive?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlive. But unlikely to stay that way if Valravn manages to extract him out of here. I want him alive, and so do you, so let\u2019s put our heads together.\u201d</p>\n<p>She dropped to her knees as Pierre crawled next to her.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do we know you are telling the truth?\u201d he probed.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d Farhan shrugged. \u201cIf you have a better lead, feel free to head out. I\u2019m a big boy, I can handle myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pierre growled in irritation \u2014 his classic response when forced into a choice he didn\u2019t want to make. \u201cYour decision, Ariadne.\u201d</p>\n<p>She could tell Farhan was lying through his teeth. Not about the prisoner \u2014 about handling himself. Another shot, and this one was returned with a hail of gunfire into the valley wall a few meters to their right. All of them dropped a few inches lower.</p>\n<p>After a few seconds, she angrily slid forward next to Farhan\u2019s sniper nest.</p>\n<p>\u201cGoddamnit. Fine. What\u2019s your plan?\u201d</p>\n<p>He wasn\u2019t facing her, but she could hear the smile in his voice. \u201cKnew you\u2019d come around. I just need a distraction. Believe it or not, Valravn\u2019s prison guards are kind of fucking morons. That\u2019s what you get when you pick up the Marines dregs stupid enough to buy the whole valknut dogshit. Anyone with a lick of sense works for Myrmidon or ARGUS AFC\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFarhan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight. Anyway, idiots. Bad ammo storage practice. I\u2019ve been surveilling the camp for weeks. That supply building right there\u2014\u201d He pointed out one of the prefab buildings. \u201cStuffed with enough spare munitions packed poorly that if I light it up, whole place gets blown to kingdom come.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow close do you need to get?\u201d</p>\n<p>He barked a laugh. She noticed an unfamiliar hoarseness in his voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can do it from here, spitfire. Problem is\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOur man gets turned into ash just as well,\u201d Pierre piped up.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot that I\u2019m necessarily <em>opposed</em> to that, mind. But then I wouldn\u2019t get to spend any more time with you!\u201d</p>\n<p>Pierre scowled. \u201cDo you have a plan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCourse. I draw their fire. You go in and get him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Silence for a moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you have a plan that\u2026 won\u2019t get us killed?\u201d Sameer asked, with full sincerity.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine. The camp isn\u2019t nearly as full as it looks; they\u2019ve been shipping men out like mad to Brazil. Maybe half a dozen POWs and thirty troops.\u201d</p>\n<p>Another whipcrack. This time, she got to see the Gepare up close as it kicked violently backward with the recoil of the shot and spat out a casing.</p>\n<p>\u201cTwenty-nine. Go around the left side \u2014 the fence is unprotected. I\u2019ll keep pulling them out of the right gate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPierre and I\u2019ll go. Sameer, stick around and cover him.\u201d The agent nodded, crawling up to Farhan\u2019s other side and setting up his own rifle.</p>\n<p>Farhan looked at him, then back at Ari. \u201cTouching of you to care.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t oversell yourself. I just don\u2019t want to have to drag a corpse through security checkpoints.\u201d</p>\n<p>A silent, lopsided smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do we know which of them is our man?\u201d Pierre asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know what to look for,\u201d Ari interjected.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen let us go before we lose our distraction.\u201d If Farhan had a reaction to being called a distraction, he didn\u2019t let it show.</p>\n<p>Pierre and Ari crawled to the other side of the ridge, jerkingly sliding down the rock bluff back into the tall grass and moving quickly through it, PC swimming through after them. On the other side of the field, gunfire was being exchanged \u2014 slow, steady shots from Farhan and quicker shots from Sameer\u2019s SCAR, against a halting stream of fire from the gates of the camp. Shouting behind it.</p>\n<p>Most of the spotlights were aimed at the bluff now, so the leftmost corner of the camp was utterly dark when they reached it. Pierre moved in front of her, drawing a small multi-tool off his belt and getting to work on the chain-link. A minute later, there was enough give to peel back the fencing and let the three of them crawl in.</p>\n<p>The pop-pop of gunfire a few hundred feet away was hard to ignore, but they crouched in the dark space between one of the prefabs and the fence.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich one of the buildings was it?\u201d she whispered</p>\n<p>Pierre silently pointed one out slightly ahead of them, gun in hand. They crept forward, peering around the corner of the building they were hiding behind.</p>\n<p>Two soldiers, wearing Valravn fatigues and body armor. One, a sergeant, was barking into a radio in Swedish, Finnish, something. Both armed and facing away from them \u2014 but blocking their path to the other building. There didn\u2019t look to be anyone else about; probably running to address the firefight going on at the entrance, she thought.</p>\n<p>Ari looked back at Pierre and signalled to him. He nodded, quietly dashing across the open gap to the next building. She tapped her mic and whispered. \u201cSameer, need cover in three seconds. Over.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRoger. Tell me when you\u2019re clear. Over.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then held up three fingers \u2014 two \u2014 one.</p>\n<p>A hail of gunfire erupted from the ridge. At the same time, she swung around with her Tavor and planted three shots into the sergeant \u2014 two in the chest, one in the head. He crumpled. The other barely had time to swing around before Pierre dropped him \u2014 one in the kneecap, one in the head.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think we\u2019re clear. Over.\u201d</p>\n<p>The sustained gunfire from the ridge stopped and returned to steady, methodical bursts. At a clicked command, PC dashed out, bit into the sergeant\u2019s shoulder and pulled him closer, leaving a bloody smear across the dirt. Ari ignored the slack-jawed, glassy-eyed surprise you only see on the faces of the dead and frisked his vest, then his belt, then his pockets until she found what she was looking for; a simple keycard.</p>\n<p>\u201cAsk Farhan if he sees anyone between us and the building. Over.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStandby.\u201d</p>\n<p>A moment of tense silence as the deafening booms coming from the Gepard ceased.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe says you\u2019re clear,\u201d Sameer answered crisply. \u201cHurry now. Over.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRoger.\u201d</p>\n<p>One quick glance, and then they dashed clear across the open area of the camp. They cast long shadows from the floodlights until they reached the prefab \u2014 a small Quonset. The door had an electronic lock in it, and she slid the keycard in.</p>\n<p>Red light.</p>\n<p>She slid it in again. Another redlight.</p>\n<p>\u201cAriadne?\u201d Pierre was facing away from her, covering her back. She could tell he was bristling at being exposed.</p>\n<p>\u201cKeycard\u2019s bad. Hold on.\u201d She leaned forward, forcing the metal fingers of her left hand between the door and doorframe just above the lock. Then twisted, forcing the door away from its frame. It strained.</p>\n<p>\u201cAriadne..\u201d</p>\n<p>She grunted in response, twisting her entire forearm, separating it another few millimeters until\u2014</p>\n<p>The door popped free with a crack, the metal bolt split uselessly in two. She swung it open and they moved into nearly-complete darkness. PC whined, and she flicked her nightvision on.</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus Christ.\u201d</p>\n<p>The familiar scent of confined misery \u2014 sweat, stale piss, and blood \u2014 filled her nostrils. It was more of a kennel than anything \u2014 two rows of fenced \u201ccells\u201d, if you could call them that. No bigger than a few feet on either side. And, despite what Farhan had said, more than half of them were filled with prisoners. Orange pants, cuffs around their arms and occasionally chains binding them to the wall, and uniform black bags on their heads.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>A low chorus of moans rang out \u2014 one or two of them were in English or Spanish, but even the ones she didn\u2019t recognize, she understood. Pleas not to hurt them again.</p>\n<p>\u201cFarhan! You said there were half a dozen prisoners, there have to be twenty in here!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh.\u201d He seemed genuinely surprised. \u201cWell, we\u2019re only interested in one, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow are we going to <em>find him</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s seen them up close, you figure it out. Over.\u201d</p>\n<p>They moved down the central alley, peering into the cages. It was difficult to differentiate any of the prisoners, unified only by their low whimpers and moans. Pierre swore under his breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey are torturing them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFucking hell.\u201d</p>\n<p>She noticed PC had bounded ahead, staring directly into one of the cages. The dog was growling lowly, ears up. The prisoner inside was kneeling in the center of his space, hands on his knees, perfectly unmoving. No whimpers, no pleas. Something about him made the hair on the back of her neck stand up. A familiar sensation.</p>\n<p>In spite of herself, she banged the butt of her rifle against his door. \u201cHey. What\u2019s your name?\u201d</p>\n<p>No response.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p>\n<p>Nothing. She leaned down and wrapped her prosthetic around the padlock before squeezing, and it came apart like plywood; cheap metal. The cage door swung free.</p>\n<p>\u201cShit!\u201d</p>\n<p>She barely had time to react before he silently lunged. It was animal, desperate \u2014 single-minded and purely relying on the element of surprise. He accomplished almost nothing, hands cuffed as they were, but succeeded in forcing Ari to step back and grip the first handhold she saw \u2014 the black bag. It slipped a few inches up, revealing his chin.</p>\n<p>And suddenly it was back again, that brutal vertigo, the sensation she\u2019d felt so many months ago in that server room in Japan. Of looking into a pure-black abyss, the absence of personhood and exclusion of identity. Tripping, sliding, falling\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cAriadne?\u201d</p>\n<p>It was Pierre. He\u2019d pulled the bag back down, obscuring the prisoner\u2019s face again. She realized she was panting.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck. Thanks. That\u2019s our boy. Don\u2019t let him take the bag off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pierre flashed something at her \u2014 a small transdermal patch. She recognized the yellow label and nodded. He peeled the safety layer away and slapped it to the prisoner\u2019s neck; a few seconds later, his quiet writhing weakened. He was still conscious as Ari led him out the door and back to the hole in the fence, just limply following along, stumbling occasionally.</p>\n<p>The firefight was still raging when the three of them squeezed out. The prisoner collapsed into the grass a few dozen meters away from the fence, and Ari dragged him over a small hill into some meager cover. Her radio crackled and Farhan\u2019s voice came through.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you killed him. Over.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust a sedative patch. He\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAm I clear to go, then? Running just a tiny bit short on ammo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Pierre\u2019s voice firmly cut through.</p>\n<p>Ari looked at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf your friend blows the camp, the prisoners will be burnt alive.\u201d</p>\n<p>Farhan seemed legitimately surprised. \u201cYou know that chances are most of those guys are Valravn defectors, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t <em>care</em>,\u201d Pierre said, crawling back towards the fence. \u201cThere is such a thing as honor. I would not expect you to understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood, because I don\u2019t. Ari, go get your friend before I light the place up.\u201d</p>\n<p>She gave an exasperated sigh, looking between the supine prisoner and Pierre crawling back through the fence hole.</p>\n<p>\u201cGod fucking damnit. PC, stay.\u201d</p>\n<p>The dog barked, planting himself next to the body as Ari rushed to the fencehole, creeping in and catching up with Pierre. He didn\u2019t stop for her.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo not try to stop me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m helping you, jackass.\u201d</p>\n<p>His voice softened. \u201cOh.\u201d</p>\n<p>They swept into the cellblock building again. This time, the prisoners seemed a bit more active, turning to follow the sources of noise.</p>\n<p>The radio crackled to life again.</p>\n<p>\u201cAri, I don\u2019t see you getting out of there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving twenty prisoners to get torched alive, Farhan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not waiting for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Silence.</p>\n<p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re terrible for me. Just hurry up.\u201d</p>\n<p>She was glad he couldn\u2019t see her smirk as she went down the line, cracking the padlocks.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey! Listen to me. We\u2019re not Valravn, we\u2019re getting you out of here. If you can walk, get to your feet and pull the bags off your head. The cell doors are popped. Stay behind us.\u201d</p>\n<p>She repeated the message in Spanish and Greek, and Pierre did it in French, Russian, and Afrikaans. She hoped that would cover their bases, and almost all of them were standing by the end of it. She scanned their faces \u2014 young men mostly, a few with shades of grey in their crew cuts.</p>\n<p>\u201cFollow us. If you can\u2019t walk, we\u2019ll be back for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>She covered the door as they streamed out, half-crawling in a train led by Pierre. As they filtered out, she counted only one limp form still in a cell. She hoped they weren\u2019t dead.</p>\n<p>Pierre returned the better part of two minutes later.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have them planted a few meters away from the package. I told them the dog will rip their throat out if they try to disturb the body.\u201d</p>\n<p>She nodded. \u201cOne left. You drag, I\u2019ll cover.\u201d</p>\n<p>They pushed into the cell in question, and Ari felt for a pulse with her right hand. Weak, but present. She nodded and Pierre traded places with her, lifting the body over his shoulder into a fireman\u2019s carry. His FAMAS hung by his side as they streamed out of the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cFarhan, we\u2019re almost out, how are you\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Three gunshots. To her right, Pierre crumpled.</p>\n<p>She spun around, raised her Tavor, and dropped to her knees in one fluid motion. A single Valravn soldier, out of cover and firing a handgun across the camp. She planted four return shots, one in the leg, two in the body, one in the head. He died quietly.</p>\n<p>\u201cPierre? You with me, buddy?\u201d</p>\n<p>He was lying in a heap, prisoner on top of him. She rolled him over.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck!\u201d</p>\n<p>Blood leaking through his fatigues in his abdomen, to the right side. She tore the fabric hole further; the flesh underneath was a bloody mess. He seemed conscious, but his face was contorted in pain.</p>\n<p>\u201cPierre\u2019s hit, I\u2019m pulling him out. Farhan, overwatch, please. Over.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFucking <em>perfect</em>. I got you, go. Over.\u201d</p>\n<p>This wasn\u2019t her first time in this situation \u2014 there was an oft-remembered incident years ago during her time in Hammer Down \u2014 but it never quite got any less stressful. Her hands raced across Pierre\u2019s vest, pulling out the gauze and rapidly packing it into the wound. It turned red almost immediately, but she kept packing, doing her best to staunch the flow. Then she turned, threw her Tavor across her back, grabbed Pierre\u2019s collar with one hand and the prisoner\u2019s collar with the other, and began crawling backwards, dragging them both through the dirt.</p>\n<p>Her muscles strained. She was far from out of shape, but Pierre and the anonymous prisoner were probably over three hundred pounds between them. She grimaced as she slowly pulled them behind a prefab and towards the hole in the fence. The terror that someone would come around a corner didn\u2019t help matters. Her hackles raised steadily.</p>\n<p>Farhan\u2019s voice. \u201cYou\u2019re clear. Keep going, you\u2019re doing great.\u201d Words of encouragement every few seconds, and for once, she couldn\u2019t detect any hint of biting sarcasm in his voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her hackles didn\u2019t quite lower, but the shaking did stop. Finally, she pulled Pierre through the hole and into the tall grass, then the prisoner. Pierre\u2019s eyes were fluttering now.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not looking good. I\u2019m getting behind the hill.\u201d</p>\n<p>She kept dragging them through the grass, to where they left PC and the body. She released a breath she didn\u2019t realize she was holding when they came over the top. The dog \u2014 and his prize \u2014 were still there, along with the twenty-odd other prisoners. Two of them crawled up to her when they saw her dragging the bodies \u2014 one younger and one older.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>T\u0101 m\u0101 de.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuckin\u2019 help her.\u201d</p>\n<p>Together, they pulled the bodies behind the cover of the hill. Another prisoner crawled up to Pierre\u2019s limp form.</p>\n<p>\u201cMove over. I got him. I\u2019m a combat medic.\u201d</p>\n<p>She stepped away, metal hand dripping blood. The man \u2014 Australian, from the sound of his voice \u2014 almost immediately got to work on Pierre, pulling items from his vest pockets. Ari panted into the mic.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re clear. We\u2019re clear. Go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Farhan didn\u2019t respond \u2014 but over on the ridge, she saw a bright, blinding flash for half a second, far bigger than the halos around his gun.</p>\n<p>Sameer now. \u201cHe just vanish\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Ari dropped to the ground, shielding her face from the massive fireball. The wave of heat nearly threw her backward, the hill offering some meager cover. She opened her eyes again. What was left of the camp was aflame, torched, utterly consumed by the inferno rising a dozen feet into the air. The fire danced, lighting up the entire valley.</p>\n<p>Some of the flames condensed into the shape of a person, striding across to the handful of Valravn soldiers on the other side that hadn\u2019t been instantly incinerated. They crawled backward in abject terror. She tore her gaze away, but she could still hear the screaming.</p>\n<p>And for a brief moment, Ari stood there, bathing in the heat, listening to her friend\u2019s death rattles, and watched the valley burn.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"rnb-navbar\">\n<div class=\"rnb-item rnb-last\">\n<p><a href=\"/segfault\" style=\"display: block;\"><span class=\"rnb-supertitle\">PREVIOUS</span><br/>\n\u00ab SEGFAULT \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rnb-item rnb-current site7nav\">\n<p><a href=\"/secure-facility-dossier-site-7\">SITE-7</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rnb-item rnb-next\">\n<p><span class=\"rnb-supertitle\">COMING SOON</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/daemon\">Site-7: DAEMON</a>\" by Rounderhouse, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Still, it was odd to think that she\u2019d been at Site-7 for more than a year. A year of below-zero blizzards, a year of biannual days and nights. A year of Two and Rita and all the rest. She flexed her gloved fingers. A year with this.\n\n\n\nSuddenly, the truck turned a sharp left to follow the mountain road; she shot her hand out, grabbing one of the straps dangling overhead to steady herself. It tore clean off in her hand. She grimaced.\n\n\n\nAcross from her, Pierre snorted. It was odd seeing him without his trademark arctic camouflage; he\u2019d ditched it a few days ago for generic desert fatigues better suited to their new surroundings, same as her. He\u2019d also shaved at some point, abandoning the blond pencil mustache for reasons unknown. The look only served to further compound her sense of unfamiliarity.\n\n\n\nShe threw the strap at him. He caught it, slinging it into the dark recesses of the truck\u2019s bed where PC was curled up. The dog pawed at the fabric curiously before returning to his nap. There were no seats, so they sat with their backs to the side walls. \u201cNot so rough. This isn\u2019t one of our Condors. Cannot stand up to your usual abuse.\u201d\n\n\n\nPierre had a point. Ari had gotten used to travelling in the viciously-overpowered heavy-lift quadcopters that Site-7 relied on. Each one of those was about the size of a Chinook; they had to be, since moving people and equipment between the different platforms was such a pain otherwise. Unfortunately, any kind of air transport was impractical in Kashmir, drenched as it is in radar stations, security watchpoints, and missile warning equipment. One pilot\u2019s mismanuever could spiral out into nuclear warfare. So instead, here they were, riding in the back of an army truck over what could generously be called roads.\n\n\n\nThey\u2019d left Site-69 in Delhi just before dawn. It wasn\u2019t a staging facility, strictly a research and coordination facility for the Stellar Affairs Division; the pair had been staying there for two days while waiting for the go order. She\u2019d never been to the Johnson Space Center, but imagined this is what it looked like \u2014 all vast rooms of people staring at charts and screens and data readouts of spacecraft. Her Level 5 clearance got her into any room she wanted, and the engineers were all too happy to answer any questions she had. She got the distinct sense they assumed she was there on Council business \u2014 which, in a way, she was. Indulging childhood interests in being an astronaut was just a perk of the job. Regardless, she wasn\u2019t sorry when they left the facility behind on the road to Kashmir.\n\n\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d she grumbled. \u201cI\u2019ve ridden in these pieces of shit more times than I can count.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe nodded. \u201cYes. Army Rangers. Did you ever come here?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cKashmir? No, but we got pretty close; I was set up in Islamabad for a while training some Pakistani guys. And then before I got assigned to Site-7, I was at 34 at in western Pakistan, but that was far enough away that we never really needed to worry. What about you?\u201d\n\n\n\nHe shook his head. \u201cAfghanistan and Iraq. Some fighting, some training.\u201d\n\n\n\nTheir headsets crackled to life. \u201cComing up to a checkpoint.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe pressed a button. \u201cRoger.\u201d\n\n\n\nWith practiced precision, Ari and Pierre lifted up the canvas sheet on the floor of the truckbed, sliding his FAMAS and her Tavor under it. It wouldn\u2019t stand up to a serious search, but if someone got that far, they probably had bigger problems to worry about. The goal was to make it as unappealing and uninteresting as possible to search the truck.\n\n\n\n\u00a0The WorkStar slowed to a crawl and they waited in tense silence for a few seconds, hearing some movement up ahead. They\u2019d had to pass a few checkpoints on their way here; they hadn\u2019t run into issues yet, but these kinds of things were always a toss-up. One security guard waking up on the wrong side of the bed that day was really all it took. \n\n\n\nAri looked up as figures rounded the back of the truck. A severe-looking Indian Army captain flanked by two soldiers carrying M16s, all dressed in pixelated camouflage and maroon berets. The captain silently raked his gaze across the the truck bed. The scene couldn\u2019t be particularly reassuring: two obvious Americans, dressed in military equipment, deep in contested territory. \n\n\n\nLuckily, the maroon military passports both of them offered, proudly embossed with \u201cOFFICIAL PASSPORT \u2014 United States of America,\u201d seemed to address those concerns. The captain took it, flipped through it, comparing the photos inside to the pair of them, looking it over a second and third time. Held onto it for a second, as though half-expecting it to burst into flames and reveal some elaborate ruse. Nothing happened. \n\n\n\n\u201cStrange to see Americans here,\u201d he commented in crisp English, clearly probing them for a reaction.\n\n\n\nShe saw Pierre\u2019s eyebrow twitch. She kept her amusement internal.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe go where we\u2019re ordered,\u201d she answered. Not too evasive, appealing to his sensibilities as a fellow soldier.\n\n\n\nIt worked. He returned the passports, giving someone out of view a stiff nod. The truck rumbled and started up again, inching forward, leaving the security checkpoint behind. She released a breath she didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d been holding.\n\n\n\n\u201cGet over it, Pierre,\u201d she ribbed.\n\n\n\n\u201cI will not. You are American; you may revel in being a daughter of your country. I refuse to be associated with that particular disaster.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe rolled her eyes and changed the subject.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat was that, the fifth checkpoint?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSixth. The Indian Army takes Kashmir deathly seriously.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe cast another look outside the back of the truck. The landscape unfolded behind her; they were high in the mountains by now, letting her see the vibrant greenery of the endless Kashmir Valley below. Crystal-blue rivers snaked through the forests and meadows. Far in the north, she could see glacial lakes from the Karakoram Range\u2019s springtime thaw. The tableau was natural. Peaceful.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful. Hard to think of it as the cause of so much conflict.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThings worth fighting for rarely appear that way to outsiders.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re saying you think this place is worth waging nuclear war over?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI am saying that all involved parties certainly believe it is.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gotten bad lately?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cVery bad. The Indian Army is building up a massive troop presence; Pakistan is responding in kind from the west, and China is sending security forces to reinforce the border of their claimed territory in the east.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah, but that kind of brinksmanship is kind of the name of the game here, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNothing new under the sun, yes. But when all three of these countries are nuclear powers, is brinksmanship a game you want to be playing under any circumstances?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFair enough.\u201d She leaned back, leaning a hand out and scratching PC between the ears. \u201cWell, that\u2019s the mundane side, right? What\u2019s the anomalous angle?\u201d\n\n\n\nPierre smiled. \u201cAha. Are the matters really separate? Consider why Pakistan, India, and China might want the land, other than wanting it so the others can\u2019t have it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were into geopolitics.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt behooves one to know what they\u2019re fighting for. The answer is control and resources. Kashmir is as drenched in anomalies as anywhere else on earth, and everyone in the veiled world wants to be the one in control of them.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe furrowed her brow. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I buy that. I don\u2019t think this conflict is just about anomalies.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u201cI did not say it was; this conflict is political too. This side just helps. And it explains why the United Nations has a detachment of \u2018peacekeepers\u2019 here \u2014 really just a cover story for the two UNGOC Strike Teams in the valley. Your PENTAGRAM has a presence here as well, the 1st Psychoartillery Battalion.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is psychoartillery?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cConceptual bombardment. A well-trained team of psychics can, with the right fire support, completely immobilize an entire company from kilometers away. Hours of being barraged with vivid hallucinations of your own torn-apart corpse being strung up from the lightpoles will halt even the best-trained soldiers.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cJesus.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd then you have Pakistan\u2019s Inter-Service Intelligence knee-deep in trying to foment an insurgency here. India\u2019s Research and Analysis Wing\u2019s Special Research Center. Since there is a religious angle at play here, there is almost certainly an ORIA operative or two skulking around.\u201d He was cleaning his gun as he talked, not looking up as he wiped down the barrel of the FAMAS.\n\n\n\n\u201cFarhan used to work for ORIA.\u201d She paused. \u201cThat\u2019s what he told me, anyway. Could be why he\u2019s here.\u201d\n\n\n\nIf Pierre noticed the hesitation, he didn\u2019t mention it. \u201cPossible. Or, more likely, he\u2019s working for one of the parasites that have been drawn by the smell of blood in the water.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you talking about?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Valravn Corporation. Christofascists, nationalists, spineless dogs, all joined together in the name of profiting from war. I have a low opinion of mercenaries; I have an even lower opinion of Nazis.\u201d His lip curled and he clunked the rifle\u2019s parts back together harshly.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard of them. I really don\u2019t think Farhan would work with those kinds of people.\u201d\n\n\n\nFinally, Pierre looked up at her. \u201cHe\u2019s a dog of war, Ariadne. He is a freelancer, and when you fight for nothing more than a bank account, you fight for the largest bank account you can find. Nevermind who \u2014 or what \u2014 is attached to it. I may not be perfect, but I know what I\u2019m fighting for.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe found she didn\u2019t have a response. They lapsed into silence as the road continued curling uphill. Pierre\u2019s words lingered in her head.\n\n\n\nI know what I\u2019m fighting for.\n\n----\n\nBefore her eyes fluttered open, her hand had already shot out to wrap around the grip of her gun. Another hand landed on top of it, stopping her. \n\n\n\n\u201cJust me, Ariadne. Calm.\u201d \n\n\n\nPierre, his head framed by the light outside the back of the truck. She took a few seconds to steady herself. \n\n\n\n\u201cWe arrived. You fell asleep.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI can see that,\u201d she commented, slinging her rifle over her back and hopping out of the truck bed. PC followed, jumping to the ground and barking happily. Ari shushed him; the dog was wearing a padded vest around his midsection, complete with a spare mag for Pierre\u2019s FAMAS.\n\n\n\nThey were in a village, nestled in the crook of the mountain. Low brown buildings lined either side of the dirt road that the truck was parked on. People walked past in an eclectic mix of traditional and Western clothing, tunics on top of blue jeans and brightly-colored shalwar, throwing intrigued and surprised glances towards the two. \n\n\n\nShe turned around \u2014 only to freeze as she remembered that there was no one to help out of the truck this time. David wasn\u2019t here. She turned again to Pierre just as he threw something at her: a brown shawl, rolled into a ball. She raised an eyebrow at him.\n\n\n\n\u201cI hope you\u2019re not expecting me to wear this.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNot like that. Like this.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe draped his own (patterned black-and-white) around his neck, where it hung and obscured much of the gun strapped around his chest.\n\n\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe mimicked him, trying to ignore the stares as they approached the building they had parked next to. Pierre rapped twice against the wooden door with the peeling blue paint. For a moment, they heard movement inside; then a man\u2019s voice on the other side.\n\n\n\n\u201cDoes the black moon howl?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOnly for the pain of regret,\u201d Pierre answered. Several locks opened in quick succession on the other side, then the door swung loose. They stepped in.\n\n\n\nIt was a small but neat space; not much more than a few cots, a radio, and a kitchenette, illuminated by a lightbulb overhead. The door to what Ari assumed was a bathroom was built into the far wall. The man sharing the space with them was young-ish, about in his thirties or forties, of South Asian descent, with curly hair and a beard. A striped button-down, khakis, and wire-rimmed glasses completed the accountant look.\n\n\n\nHe stuck a hand out to them.\n\n\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d he said as they shook. A British accent, unexpectedly. \u201cSupport Agent Sameer Mukherjee. You weren\u2019t followed?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNot that I saw,\u201d Ari answered as the man rushed back to the door, relocking the seven locks.\n\n\n\n\u201cGood. Good. The dog is trained?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBetter than most people.\u201d Ari gave a sharp click, and PC dropped prone to the floor. \u201cAre you our escort to Site-786?\u201d\n\n\n\nSameer looked at her with a rueful smile, waving a hand around the cramped safehouse. \u201cThis //is// Site-786, Secretary Katsaros. Sorry to disappoint.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe blinked. \u201cOh. I\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThought it would be bigger? If only. The situation is so unstable that the Council has mostly suspended operations in Kashmir for nearly a decade now. This safehouse is just kept around in case of the occasional emergency \u2014 which I take it this is.\u201d\n\n\n\nPierre looked back. \u201cThey didn\u2019t tell you why we were coming.\u201d It was more of a declaration than a question.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was only given the vaguest outlines by SARC \u2014 a blackbag operation of a high-value target. Further information would be appreciated.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not looking for help,\u201d Pierre said coolly.\n\n\n\nSameer raised his hands in surrender. \u201cSincerest apologies. I didn\u2019t mean to imply anything. But I\u2019ve been assigned here for four years; I\u2019d be surprised if there\u2019s something around here I //couldn\u2019t// help you find.\u201d\n\n\n\nAri looked around the tiny room. \u201cYou\u2019ve been here for four years?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThere were five of us, originally, but reassignments and incidents and so on and so forth. The Foundation didn\u2019t want to risk any more personnel than it had to.\u201d The unspoken implication hung in the air: that Command was content to risk him.\n\n\n\n\u201cIgnore Pierre. We\u2019ll take all the help we can get.\u201d Ari smiled. \n\n\n\n\u201cExcellent. Who \u2014 or what, I should say \u2014 are you looking for? So long as they\u2019re not a ghost, I should be able to help.\u201d\n\n\n\nPierre and Ari exchanged a glance.\n\n----\n\n\u201cJust to make sure I\u2019ve got it right: you\u2019re trying to abduct an ORIA-trained, CIA-connected, GOC-equipped soldier of fortune with a demon inside his eye socket.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cA djinn,\u201d Ari corrected. \u201cHe\u2019s very insistent that they\u2019re different. But yeah.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Sameer leaned back. \u201cThat\u2019s troublesome.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt had gotten dark \u2014 not that they\u2019d noticed, with no windows in the safehouse. They were seated on the cots, PC curled up under one, and Sameer leaning against a card table he\u2019d conjured up. He\u2019d also conjured up a few bowls of some kind of yellow stew that they were now devouring. PC was nibbling at a can of dog food.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you call this again?\u201d Pierre asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cDaal. Do you think he\u2019s going to come willingly?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHard to say.\u201d Ari shrugged. \u201cOn one hand, we have a history, and I think I can pressure him into at least hearing us out. On the other, if it comes between us and the job\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll pick the job.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know that, Pierre.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWithout further knowledge, we must assume he will be uncooperative, and prepare accordingly.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe tried to make it seem like her lack of response was because her mouth was full and not because she didn\u2019t have one.\n\n\n\nSameer was lost in thought. \u201cSo you have no real idea who he\u2019s working for?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMyrmidon and Valravn are the frontrunners, at the moment, but it\u2019s an open question.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t respond; instead, he leaned to a cupboard and pulled out a rolled-up paper that he spread out across the card table. It was a map of northwestern Kashmir, lovingly pencilled-in with various lines and areas and notes in the margins in English and Bengali. He tapped one area of the map, near a snaking river, that had been circled in red.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cA military encampment I\u2019ve been keeping an eye on for several weeks. It sprung up out of practically nowhere; I pass through that valley regularly, and was stunned to find a military checkpoint where there had been nothing but a meadow the previous night.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDo you know whose?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cRegrettably not. There was an absence of markings, which means we can at least rule out the \u2018legitimate\u2019 combatants. And this isn\u2019t hard evidence, but I will say that none of the soldiers looked like they were from the region \u2014 lots of pale skin and brown hair.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWesterners. Defining accents?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI have not yet gotten close enough to listen in. I suspect they have laid landmines.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cForce estimation?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDifficult to say \u2014 at least two platoons, maybe up to a company.\u201d\n\n\n\nAri whistled. \u201cThat\u2019s not good.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cToo many for a direct confrontation, certainly.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBut we do not know whose camp it is. And how it circles back to us \u2014 if at all.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not wrong,\u201d Sameer agreed. \u201cThis region is unstable enough nowadays that it could be an unrelated, coincidental troop movement.\u201d\n\n\n\nAri nodded. \u201cEither way, I think it\u2019s clear we need to get a closer look before we can decide anything. When can we get out there?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about seven klicks from our current location; we can scout around tonight, if you like.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThat works. If you give us the coordinates, Pierre and I can make our way there\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be going with you,\u201d Sameer answered matter-of-factly.\n\n\n\nShe exchanged a glance with Pierre. \u201cThis is reconnaissance on a military camp. Dangerous, doubly so for anyone without MTF experience. I\u2019m not dinging your agent training, I went through the same shit, but you can\u2019t really\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cTwenty-two SG, Squad 3.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\nPierre seemed to understand the phrase. \u201cThe Special Group, the special forces arm of the Indian Research and Analysis Wing; equivalent to your CIA\u2019s Special Activities Center.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, fuck.\u201d Ari looked him up and down; he resembled a financial advisor more than he did a special forces operator. \u201cI didn\u2019t take you for military.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThat is sort of the point, yes. But trust me \u2014 I can handle myself. And I would be remiss if I let you walk into unfamiliar territory without a guide.\u201d He smiled.\n\n\n\nAri nodded. \u201cYou\u2019ll need equipment.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe turned to a metal crate in the corner and popped the latches, revealing at least half a dozen firearms packed inside. \n\n\n\n\u201cThat won\u2019t be a problem. The sun just set, which means we have about seven hours until the dead of night. Did you sleep in the truck?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe road was a bit too bumpy for anyone except PC to get any shut-eye.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThen I suggest you take the opportunity now.\u201d\n\n----\n\nAri laid awake in the cot, staring up at the ceiling. The room was dark now; Sameer had excused himself and left, saying he\u2019d prepare some supplies and give them some time to sleep undisturbed. That\u2019d been forty minutes ago, and she was still lying awake.\n\n\n\nShe fidgeted in the cot, simple cotton blanket over top of her fatigues. PC breathed softly underneath her, and her rifle was hanging from a hook on the wall. Something wasn\u2019t right, but she couldn\u2019t put her finger on what. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou are awake.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe jumped.\n\n\n\n\u201cJesus, Pierre. Scared the shit out of me. You sleep like a corpse, you know that?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSo I have been told.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah. I\u2019m awake.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cCannot sleep?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou should. You will need it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey lapsed into silence again for a few seconds. She almost thought he\u2019d went back to sleep until he spoke up again.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou are uncomfortable. I hope it is not me; I can leave and we can take shifts, if you need.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe snorted. \u201cWho said chivalry is dead? But no, it\u2019s not that. I just feel weird.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAre you concerned about Farhan?\u201d\n\n\n\nShe thought for a moment, and was surprised to learn the answer was no. This worry was something else.\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWould you like to hear my theory?\u201d He didn\u2019t turn, still facing the wall.\n\n\n\nShe let a hand dangle off the edge of the cot. PC licked it, rough tongue scraping against her skin. \u201cSure.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI think you have forgotten how to really sleep. You have been half-sleeping for a year now, because half your brain is always awake and ensuring the Director\u2019s safety. You do not know how to sleep without worrying about someone else.\u201d\n\n\n\nSilence. \n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026Yeah. Yeah, I think that\u2019s it. I\u2019m waiting to hear the clicking of him getting out of the chair. It feels wrong to sleep without it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cUnderstandable. Shows you\u2019re committed to your job. But you really must get some sleep, Ari.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSure.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnother moment of silence. \n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he is perfectly fine, for what it\u2019s worth. He\u2019s tougher than people give him credit for.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah. Yeah, I know.\u201d\n\n----\n\nThe stars were out in full-force tonight. Logically, she knew it was just because of the total distance from any major sources of light pollution \u2014 but lying on her belly in the tall grass of the valley, staring up at a legion of stars in the sky, it was hard not to feel at one with the universe.\n\n\n\nThen PC growled from next to her, and she brought herself back down to earth.\n\n\n\nShe couldn\u2019t bring her preferred stealth suit on this mission; the sleek space-age design would\u2019ve stuck out like a sore thumb. But Evie had rigged up the headset for her, and she could see Pierre and Sameer\u2019s outlines on either side of her through the grass \u2014 along with PC right next to her, his ears flattened to his head as they crawled along up the hill, all rendered in night-vision fluorescent green.\n\n\n\nThey were in a valley formed where the river snaked through the mountains, crawling up a hill that overlooked where the camp should be. The tall grass masked their movements, but Sameer\u2019s warning about landmines rung fresh in her head. They\u2019d sent PC up the hill first and he hadn\u2019t sniffed anything out, but the worry was still there.\n\n\n\nThey moved slowly, only a few feet a minute. She could see lights dancing over the top of the ridge, and turned off the nightvision when they got close.\n\n\n\n\u201cShit. They\u2019ve expanded,\u201d Sameer\u2019s voice crackled over the radio.\n\n\n\nIf anything, he\u2019d understated the situation; the encampment was at least a company in size now, with over a dozen large tents and prefab barracks spread out within the fenced confines. Even at this time of night, soldiers wandered in small packs, laughing and smoking while carrying boxes. There were watchtowers at both entrances equipped with spotlights, and barbed wire circled the top of the fences.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a fortress,\u201d she whispered into her radio. \u201cIf Farhan\u2019s in there, there\u2019s no way we\u2019re getting him out without a fight.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHold on. Look at the crates they are moving.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe leaned up and pressed a finger against her headset, zooming it in until she was seeing a digitally-magnified close-up. The soldiers \u2014 both Americans, from the looks of it \u2014 were carrying a large wooden crate between them, stamped with the symbol of a large bird of prey, wings spread.\n\n\n\n\u201cValravn Corp,\u201d Pierre breathed through the microphone. She could feel the acid in his tone.\n\n\n\n\u201cWait. Look behind them,\u201d Sameer whispered.\n\n\n\nShe tilted her gaze upward. One of the prefab barracks \u2014 the door was swinging open, and two soldiers were coming out, escorting another person between them. Someone stripped naked, with a black bag over their head. The soldiers pulled them along roughly, making them stumble as they struggled to keep pace with their hands cuffed together. They turned, revealing the prisoner\u2019s bare back.\n\n\n\n\u201cA prison camp. Makes sense \u2014 PMCs can\u2019t legally hold prisoners of war, so they go somewhere international law is disputed at best.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAriadne? Is that our man?\u201d Pierre asked.\n\n\n\nShe stared at the prisoner\u2019s retreating back.\n\n\n\n> Ari ran two fingers down the small of Farhan\u2019s back, tracing the contours of his tattoos. He smiled at her. They were curled up in his room, linen sheets wrapped around and between them. Their clothes were abandoned somewhere in the corner.\n\n> \n\n> \u201cAdmiring the view?\u201d\n\n> \n\n> She snorted. \u201cDon\u2019t oversell yourself. More like\u2026 surveying my domain.\u201d \n\n> \n\n> He bark-laughed at that. \u201cIncredible. And what do you survey? Fertile fields? Rich forests?\u201d\n\n> \n\n> \u201cYou\u2019re gross.\u201d\n\n> \n\n> \u201cAnd yet here we are.\u201d\n\n> \n\n> He pulled her into himself, and they wrestled around for a bit, further wrapping themselves in the sheets. They landed with Ari on top of him and pinning him to the bed, his grinning face half-pressed into the pillow. \n\n> \n\n> \u201cI thought tattoos were haram.\u201d\n\n> \n\n> \u201cThey are. So is premarital sex, but last time I checked I didn\u2019t see a ring on either of our fingers.\u201d\n\n> \n\n> \u201cEven if you did, I doubt that would\u2019ve stopped you.\u201d She traced the image of the cross-legged spirit on his upper back. \u201cWhat\u2019s this one?\u201d\n\n> \n\n> \u201cA djinn. An invisible spirit, smokeless fire.\u201d\n\n> \n\n> \u201cThe kind you have in your eye?\u201d\n\n> \n\n> \u201cMhm. Next to that\u2019s a scimitar \u2014 and below that, my family motto.\u201d\n\n> \n\n> \u201cWhat\u2019s it say?\u201d Her fingers danced across the Farsi lettering.\n\n> \n\n> \u201cPurification through fire.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAriadne?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not him. He has tattoos across his back. A sword, a djinn, some Farsi writing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNoted. Still, this is less than ideal.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe cannot do anything about it with only the three of us,\u201d Pierre hissed. \u201cBe realistic.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt burned her to admit it, but he was right. She zoomed in again, scanning across the camp. The soldiers leading the prisoner had vanished, and the door to the prison building \u2014 one of them, anyway \u2014 was sealed shut. \n\n\n\n\u201cWe still don\u2019t necessarily know if your man is involved here,\u201d Sameer commented.\n\n\n\nAnother soldier sauntered to the gate, saying something to the guard in the watchtower, who began to descend the ladder.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re changing the guard,\u201d Ari whispered. \n\n\n\nShe almost didn\u2019t hear the shot ring out overhead until it was too late. The telltale whipcrack of a sniper shot rang out from behind them before both soldiers fell to the ground at the base of the watchtower, dead. The three of them flattened themselves to the ground and flicked their safeties off as the shot echoed through the valley. It took a second or three for the camp to explode in activity: soldiers in blue-gray uniform came rushing out of the barracks, shouting in a mix of English and something Scandinavian. \n\n\n\nNone of them spoke. Ari instinctively moved her hand to a form a circle over her right eye \u2014 \u201cSNIPER\u201d. \n\n\n\nPierre was already rolled onto his back, FAMAS aimed at the ridge behind them. For a second, there was nothing there \u2014 then a flash of red and orange and a glinting light as another shot rang out, wreathed in fire. She recognized it instantly.\n\n\n\nShe rose to an army crawl, pulling away from the camp toward the direction of the ridge. Pierre hissed from behind her.\n\n\n\n\u201cAriadne! What are you //doing?//\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s him. We need to get up there,\u201d she grunted. PC whined next to her.\n\n\n\nSameer followed her, albeit several paces behind. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d\n\n\n\nAnother shot rang out overhead, accompanied by that same half-second halo of fire.\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah. Yeah, it\u2019s him.\u201d\n\n\n\nPierre looked torn. Then, with an exasperated sigh, he got to his knees and began chasing them through the grass.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe shots are echoing throughout the valley, so they can\u2019t pinpoint where he\u2019s firing from,\u201d Sameer grunted as they reached the foothills of the ridge. They\u2019d have to climb it.\n\n\n\n\u201cWill not buy us more than a minute. Two, at most.\u201d\n\n\n\nAri didn\u2019t speak, focusing on pulling herself up the rocky crags of the ridge. It was an outcropping from the valley wall, clear of grass and shrubbery. PC took to it naturally, using all four legs to bound up to the plateau. She clicked sharply to bring him back down.\n\n\n\nThen, heart pounding out of her chest, drew her Uzi. Pierre noticed the movement and nodded, pulling his own sidearm. They crested the hill, dropping back down to an army crawl.\n\n\n\nShe flicked her night vision on again. There, a few meters ahead of them and lying on his belly behind a Gep\u00e1rd M6 anti-mat\u00e9riel rifle, was Farhan. He was lining up another shot, eye pressed to the scope. \n\n\n\nShe put motioned forward to the other two with a finger to her lips before rising to her feet silently, Uzi gripped with both hands and trained steadily on his back. Pierre and Sameer moved behind her, guns raised. PC dropped to his haunches, ready to pounce. She took a step forward and opened her mouth.\n\n\n\n\u201cOne second, darling.\u201d\n\n\n\nFarhan raised his other hand, signalling them to stop. She froze, more in surprise than anything else. Then another violent whipcrack sounded through the valley, nearly deafening at this range. Ari momentarily thanked Evie for ensuring the headset had built-in ear protection. As the shot echoed around the valley walls, Farhan turned from the gun towards them with a lopsided smile.\n\n\n\n\u201cHey, Ari. Been a minute.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe said the first thing that came to mind. \u201cYou look like shit.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt was true. His face was covered in dirt and dust, with small scratches around his nose. His left eye was obscured by a fabric band that wrapped at an angle around his head, and his beard hadn\u2019t been trimmed in a few weeks by the looks of it.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t look so good yourself,\u201d he said, motioning towards her. She almost didn\u2019t realize what he was referring to until she realized he was gesturing at her arm. She flicked it forward.\n\n\n\n\u201cLong story. You need to come with us.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThat was a lie, by the way. You still look great.\u201d He gave her that lopsided smile again before returning to the scope. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d\n\n\n\nPC growled at him, ears flattened. \n\n\n\n\u201cThere are at least a hundred men in that camp, Farhan. There\u2019s four of us. We need to exfil.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize we were on the same team! But I have a job to do, and I don\u2019t know your friends, anyway.\u201d Another deafening gunshot.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a negotiation. We need you, and we\u2019re all gonna die here if we stick around.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAw, you need me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI meant\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI know. You meant that you\u2019re looking for the face eaters,\u201d he said matter-of-factly.\n\n\n\nSameer and Pierre looked at her in confusion.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck is a face eater?\u201d\n\n\n\nShe ignored them. \u201cHow do you know about that?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. Worry about the fact that one of them is in that camp right now.\u201d\n\n\n\nAri\u2019s eyes widened.\n\n\n\n\u201cAlive?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAlive. But unlikely to stay that way if Valravn manages to extract him out of here. I want him alive, and so do you, so let\u2019s put our heads together.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe dropped to her knees as Pierre crawled next to her. \n\n\n\n\u201cHow do we know you are telling the truth?\u201d he probed.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d Farhan shrugged. \u201cIf you have a better lead, feel free to head out. I\u2019m a big boy, I can handle myself.\u201d\n\n\n\nPierre growled in irritation \u2014 his classic response when forced into a choice he didn\u2019t want to make. \u201cYour decision, Ariadne.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe could tell Farhan was lying through his teeth. Not about the prisoner \u2014 about handling himself. Another shot, and this one was returned with a hail of gunfire into the valley wall a few meters to their right. All of them dropped a few inches lower.\n\n\n\nAfter a few seconds, she angrily slid forward next to Farhan\u2019s sniper nest.\n\n\n\n\u201cGoddamnit. Fine. What\u2019s your plan?\u201d\n\n\n\nHe wasn\u2019t facing her, but she could hear the smile in his voice. \u201cKnew you\u2019d come around. I just need a distraction. Believe it or not, Valravn\u2019s prison guards are kind of fucking morons. That\u2019s what you get when you pick up the Marines dregs stupid enough to buy the whole valknut dogshit. Anyone with a lick of sense works for Myrmidon or ARGUS AFC\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFarhan.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cRight. Anyway, idiots. Bad ammo storage practice. I\u2019ve been surveilling the camp for weeks. That supply building right there\u2014\u201d He pointed out one of the prefab buildings. \u201cStuffed with enough spare munitions packed poorly that if I light it up, whole place gets blown to kingdom come.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHow close do you need to get?\u201d\n\n\n\nHe barked a laugh. She noticed an unfamiliar hoarseness in his voice.\n\n\n\n\u201cI can do it from here, spitfire. Problem is\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOur man gets turned into ash just as well,\u201d Pierre piped up.\n\n\n\n\u201cNot that I\u2019m necessarily //opposed// to that, mind. But then I wouldn\u2019t get to spend any more time with you!\u201d\n\n\n\nPierre scowled. \u201cDo you have a plan?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cCourse. I draw their fire. You go in and get him.\u201d\n\n\n\nSilence for a moment. \n\n\n\n\u201cDo you have a plan that\u2026 won\u2019t get us killed?\u201d Sameer asked, with full sincerity.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine. The camp isn\u2019t nearly as full as it looks; they\u2019ve been shipping men out like mad to Brazil. Maybe half a dozen POWs and thirty troops.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnother whipcrack. This time, she got to see the Gepare up close as it kicked violently backward with the recoil of the shot and spat out a casing.\n\n\n\n\u201cTwenty-nine. Go around the left side \u2014 the fence is unprotected. I\u2019ll keep pulling them out of the right gate.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cPierre and I\u2019ll go. Sameer, stick around and cover him.\u201d The agent nodded, crawling up to Farhan\u2019s other side and setting up his own rifle. \n\n\n\nFarhan looked at him, then back at Ari. \u201cTouching of you to care.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t oversell yourself. I just don\u2019t want to have to drag a corpse through security checkpoints.\u201d\n\n\n\nA silent, lopsided smile.\n\n\n\n\u201cHow do we know which of them is our man?\u201d Pierre asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cI know what to look for,\u201d Ari interjected.\n\n\n\n\u201cThen let us go before we lose our distraction.\u201d If Farhan had a reaction to being called a distraction, he didn\u2019t let it show.\n\n\n\nPierre and Ari crawled to the other side of the ridge, jerkingly sliding down the rock bluff back into the tall grass and moving quickly through it, PC swimming through after them. On the other side of the field, gunfire was being exchanged \u2014 slow, steady shots from Farhan and quicker shots from Sameer\u2019s SCAR, against a halting stream of fire from the gates of the camp. Shouting behind it.\n\n\n\nMost of the spotlights were aimed at the bluff now, so the leftmost corner of the camp was utterly dark when they reached it. Pierre moved in front of her, drawing a small multi-tool off his belt and getting to work on the chain-link. A minute later, there was enough give to peel back the fencing and let the three of them crawl in.\n\n\n\nThe pop-pop of gunfire a few hundred feet away was hard to ignore, but they crouched in the dark space between one of the prefabs and the fence. \n\n\n\n\u201cWhich one of the buildings was it?\u201d she whispered\n\n\n\nPierre silently pointed one out slightly ahead of them, gun in hand. They crept forward, peering around the corner of the building they were hiding behind.\n\n\n\nTwo soldiers, wearing Valravn fatigues and body armor. One, a sergeant, was barking into a radio in Swedish, Finnish, something. Both armed and facing away from them \u2014 but blocking their path to the other building. There didn\u2019t look to be anyone else about; probably running to address the firefight going on at the entrance, she thought. \n\n\n\nAri looked back at Pierre and signalled to him. He nodded, quietly dashing across the open gap to the next building. She tapped her mic and whispered. \u201cSameer, need cover in three seconds. Over.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cRoger. Tell me when you\u2019re clear. Over.\u201d\n\n\n\nThen held up three fingers \u2014 two \u2014 one.\n\n\n\nA hail of gunfire erupted from the ridge. At the same time, she swung around with her Tavor and planted three shots into the sergeant \u2014 two in the chest, one in the head. He crumpled. The other barely had time to swing around before Pierre dropped him \u2014 one in the kneecap, one in the head. \n\n\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re clear. Over.\u201d \n\n\n\nThe sustained gunfire from the ridge stopped and returned to steady, methodical bursts. At a clicked command, PC dashed out, bit into the sergeant\u2019s shoulder and pulled him closer, leaving a bloody smear across the dirt. Ari ignored the slack-jawed, glassy-eyed surprise you only see on the faces of the dead and frisked his vest, then his belt, then his pockets until she found what she was looking for; a simple keycard. \n\n\n\n\u201cAsk Farhan if he sees anyone between us and the building. Over.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cStandby.\u201d\n\n\n\nA moment of tense silence as the deafening booms coming from the Gepard ceased.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe says you\u2019re clear,\u201d Sameer answered crisply. \u201cHurry now. Over.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cRoger.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne quick glance, and then they dashed clear across the open area of the camp. They cast long shadows from the floodlights until they reached the prefab \u2014 a small Quonset. The door had an electronic lock in it, and she slid the keycard in. \n\n\n\nRed light. \n\n\n\nShe slid it in again. Another redlight. \n\n\n\n\u201cAriadne?\u201d Pierre was facing away from her, covering her back. She could tell he was bristling at being exposed.\n\n\n\n\u201cKeycard\u2019s bad. Hold on.\u201d She leaned forward, forcing the metal fingers of her left hand between the door and doorframe just above the lock. Then twisted, forcing the door away from its frame. It strained.\n\n\n\n\u201cAriadne..\u201d\n\n\n\nShe grunted in response, twisting her entire forearm, separating it another few millimeters until\u2014\n\n\n\nThe door popped free with a crack, the metal bolt split uselessly in two. She swung it open and they moved into nearly-complete darkness. PC whined, and she flicked her nightvision on.\n\n\n\n\u201cJesus Christ.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe familiar scent of confined misery \u2014 sweat, stale piss, and blood \u2014 filled her nostrils. It was more of a kennel than anything \u2014 two rows of fenced \u201ccells\u201d, if you could call them that. No bigger than a few feet on either side. And, despite what Farhan had said, more than half of them were filled with prisoners. Orange pants, cuffs around their arms and occasionally chains binding them to the wall, and uniform black bags on their heads.\n\n\n\n\u201cFuck.\u201d\n\n\n\nA low chorus of moans rang out \u2014 one or two of them were in English or Spanish, but even the ones she didn\u2019t recognize, she understood. Pleas not to hurt them again. \n\n\n\n\u201cFarhan! You said there were half a dozen prisoners, there have to be twenty in here!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHuh.\u201d He seemed genuinely surprised. \u201cWell, we\u2019re only interested in one, aren\u2019t we?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHow are we going to //find him//?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s seen them up close, you figure it out. Over.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey moved down the central alley, peering into the cages. It was difficult to differentiate any of the prisoners, unified only by their low whimpers and moans. Pierre swore under his breath.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey are torturing them.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFucking hell.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe noticed PC had bounded ahead, staring directly into one of the cages. The dog was growling lowly, ears up. The prisoner inside was kneeling in the center of his space, hands on his knees, perfectly unmoving. No whimpers, no pleas. Something about him made the hair on the back of her neck stand up. A familiar sensation.\n\n\n\nIn spite of herself, she banged the butt of her rifle against his door. \u201cHey. What\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\n\n\nNo response.\n\n\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d\n\n\n\nNothing. She leaned down and wrapped her prosthetic around the padlock before squeezing, and it came apart like plywood; cheap metal. The cage door swung free.\n\n\n\n\u201cShit!\u201d\n\n\n\nShe barely had time to react before he silently lunged. It was animal, desperate \u2014 single-minded and purely relying on the element of surprise. He accomplished almost nothing, hands cuffed as they were, but succeeded in forcing Ari to step back and grip the first handhold she saw \u2014 the black bag. It slipped a few inches up, revealing his chin.\n\n\n\nAnd suddenly it was back again, that brutal vertigo, the sensation she\u2019d felt so many months ago in that server room in Japan. Of looking into a pure-black abyss, the absence of personhood and exclusion of identity. Tripping, sliding, falling\u2014\n\n\n\n\u201cAriadne?\u201d\n\n\n\nIt was Pierre. He\u2019d pulled the bag back down, obscuring the prisoner\u2019s face again. She realized she was panting.\n\n\n\n\u201cFuck. Thanks. That\u2019s our boy. Don\u2019t let him take the bag off.\u201d\n\n\n\nPierre flashed something at her \u2014 a small transdermal patch. She recognized the yellow label and nodded. He peeled the safety layer away and slapped it to the prisoner\u2019s neck; a few seconds later, his quiet writhing weakened. He was still conscious as Ari led him out the door and back to the hole in the fence, just limply following along, stumbling occasionally. \n\n\n\nThe firefight was still raging when the three of them squeezed out. The prisoner collapsed into the grass a few dozen meters away from the fence, and Ari dragged him over a small hill into some meager cover. Her radio crackled and Farhan\u2019s voice came through.\n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you killed him. Over.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cJust a sedative patch. He\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAm I clear to go, then? Running just a tiny bit short on ammo.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Pierre\u2019s voice firmly cut through. \n\n\n\nAri looked at him.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf your friend blows the camp, the prisoners will be burnt alive.\u201d\n\n\n\nFarhan seemed legitimately surprised. \u201cYou know that chances are most of those guys are Valravn defectors, right?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t //care//,\u201d Pierre said, crawling back towards the fence. \u201cThere is such a thing as honor. I would not expect you to understand.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cGood, because I don\u2019t. Ari, go get your friend before I light the place up.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe gave an exasperated sigh, looking between the supine prisoner and Pierre crawling back through the fence hole.\n\n\n\n\u201cGod fucking damnit. PC, stay.\u201d \n\n\n\nThe dog barked, planting himself next to the body as Ari rushed to the fencehole, creeping in and catching up with Pierre. He didn\u2019t stop for her. \n\n\n\n\u201cDo not try to stop me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m helping you, jackass.\u201d\n\n\n\nHis voice softened. \u201cOh.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey swept into the cellblock building again. This time, the prisoners seemed a bit more active, turning to follow the sources of noise. \n\n\n\nThe radio crackled to life again.\n\n\n\n\u201cAri, I don\u2019t see you getting out of there.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not leaving twenty prisoners to get torched alive, Farhan.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not waiting for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThen do it.\u201d\n\n\n\nSilence.\n\n\n\n\u201cGod, you\u2019re terrible for me. Just hurry up.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe was glad he couldn\u2019t see her smirk as she went down the line, cracking the padlocks.\n\n\n\n\u201cHey! Listen to me. We\u2019re not Valravn, we\u2019re getting you out of here. If you can walk, get to your feet and pull the bags off your head. The cell doors are popped. Stay behind us.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe repeated the message in Spanish and Greek, and Pierre did it in French, Russian, and Afrikaans. She hoped that would cover their bases, and almost all of them were standing by the end of it. She scanned their faces \u2014 young men mostly, a few with shades of grey in their crew cuts. \n\n\n\n\u201cFollow us. If you can\u2019t walk, we\u2019ll be back for you.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe covered the door as they streamed out, half-crawling in a train led by Pierre. As they filtered out, she counted only one limp form still in a cell. She hoped they weren\u2019t dead.\n\n\n\nPierre returned the better part of two minutes later.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have them planted a few meters away from the package. I told them the dog will rip their throat out if they try to disturb the body.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe nodded. \u201cOne left. You drag, I\u2019ll cover.\u201d \n\n\n\nThey pushed into the cell in question, and Ari felt for a pulse with her right hand. Weak, but present. She nodded and Pierre traded places with her, lifting the body over his shoulder into a fireman\u2019s carry. His FAMAS hung by his side as they streamed out of the door.\n\n\n\n\u201cFarhan, we\u2019re almost out, how are you\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\nThree gunshots. To her right, Pierre crumpled.\n\n\n\nShe spun around, raised her Tavor, and dropped to her knees in one fluid motion. A single Valravn soldier, out of cover and firing a handgun across the camp. She planted four return shots, one in the leg, two in the body, one in the head. He died quietly.\n\n\n\n\u201cPierre? You with me, buddy?\u201d\n\n\n\nHe was lying in a heap, prisoner on top of him. She rolled him over. \n\n\n\n\u201cFuck!\u201d\n\n\n\nBlood leaking through his fatigues in his abdomen, to the right side. She tore the fabric hole further; the flesh underneath was a bloody mess. He seemed conscious, but his face was contorted in pain. \n\n\n\n\u201cPierre\u2019s hit, I\u2019m pulling him out. Farhan, overwatch, please. Over.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFucking //perfect//. I got you, go. Over.\u201d \n\n\n\nThis wasn\u2019t her first time in this situation \u2014 there was an oft-remembered incident years ago during her time in Hammer Down \u2014 but it never quite got any less stressful. Her hands raced across Pierre\u2019s vest, pulling out the gauze and rapidly packing it into the wound. It turned red almost immediately, but she kept packing, doing her best to staunch the flow. Then she turned, threw her Tavor across her back, grabbed Pierre\u2019s collar with one hand and the prisoner\u2019s collar with the other, and began crawling backwards, dragging them both through the dirt.\n\n\n\nHer muscles strained. She was far from out of shape, but Pierre and the anonymous prisoner were probably over three hundred pounds between them. She grimaced as she slowly pulled them behind a prefab and towards the hole in the fence. The terror that someone would come around a corner didn\u2019t help matters. Her hackles raised steadily.\n\n\n\nFarhan\u2019s voice. \u201cYou\u2019re clear. Keep going, you\u2019re doing great.\u201d Words of encouragement every few seconds, and for once, she couldn\u2019t detect any hint of biting sarcasm in his voice.\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah. Yeah.\u201d\n\n\n\nHer hackles didn\u2019t quite lower, but the shaking did stop. Finally, she pulled Pierre through the hole and into the tall grass, then the prisoner. Pierre\u2019s eyes were fluttering now.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not looking good. I\u2019m getting behind the hill.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe kept dragging them through the grass, to where they left PC and the body. She released a breath she didn\u2019t realize she was holding when they came over the top. The dog \u2014 and his prize \u2014 were still there, along with the twenty-odd other prisoners. Two of them crawled up to her when they saw her dragging the bodies \u2014 one younger and one older. \n\n\n\n\u201c//T\u0101 m\u0101 de.//\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFuckin\u2019 help her.\u201d\n\n\n\nTogether, they pulled the bodies behind the cover of the hill. Another prisoner crawled up to Pierre\u2019s limp form.\n\n\n\n\u201cMove over. I got him. I\u2019m a combat medic.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe stepped away, metal hand dripping blood. The man \u2014 Australian, from the sound of his voice \u2014 almost immediately got to work on Pierre, pulling items from his vest pockets. Ari panted into the mic.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re clear. We\u2019re clear. Go.\u201d\n\n\n\nFarhan didn\u2019t respond \u2014 but over on the ridge, she saw a bright, blinding flash for half a second, far bigger than the halos around his gun.\n\n\n\nSameer now. \u201cHe just vanish\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\nAri dropped to the ground, shielding her face from the massive fireball. The wave of heat nearly threw her backward, the hill offering some meager cover. She opened her eyes again. What was left of the camp was aflame, torched, utterly consumed by the inferno rising a dozen feet into the air. The fire danced, lighting up the entire valley. \n\n\n\nSome of the flames condensed into the shape of a person, striding across to the handful of Valravn soldiers on the other side that hadn\u2019t been instantly incinerated. They crawled backward in abject terror. She tore her gaze away, but she could still hear the screaming.\n\n\n\nAnd for a brief moment, Ari stood there, bathing in the heat, listening to her friend\u2019s death rattles, and watched the valley burn.\n\n\n\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/replica/site-7-icon.png width=\"75px\"]]\n\n----\n\n[[div class=\"rnb-navbar\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"rnb-item rnb-last\"]]\n\n[[a href=\"/segfault\" style=\"display: block;\"]][[span class=\"rnb-supertitle\"]]PREVIOUS[[/span]]\n\n<< SEGFAULT >>[[/a]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"rnb-item rnb-current site7nav\"]]\n\n[[a href=\"/secure-facility-dossier-site-7\"]]SITE-7[[/a]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"rnb-item rnb-next\"]]\n\n[[span class=\"rnb-supertitle\"]]COMING SOON[[/span]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** daemon.png\n\n> **Author:** [[*user ROUNDERHOUSE]]\n\n> **License:** CC 2.0 Generic\n\n> **Edited from:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Picture_of_the_unidentified_tank_in_use-_throwing_fire_bombs_%2824570381440%29.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** site7.png\n\n> **Author:** [[*user HarryBlank]]\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/airgap SCP Foundation Wiki]\n\n=====\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["component:info-ayers", "segfault", "secure-facility-dossier-site-7", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide", "airgap"], "tags": ["_cc", "tale"], "title": "Site-7: DAEMON - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/daemon", "year": 2024}, "damned-and-depraved": {"created_at": "2024-02-02T16:23:00", "creator": "Zer0Ne0phyte", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Zer0Ne0phyte", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/zer0ne0phyte", "comment": "the beginning of a new series", "date": "2024-02-02T16:23:00"}, {"author": "Zer0Ne0phyte", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/zer0ne0phyte", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

Any reader of this paper knows that that was <em>quite</em> an event (one this paper salaciously documented!). But, to the misfortunate of all loyal lovers of liberty, it appears that Mayor Durand and his down-ballot allies skewer towards the RED as opposed to the RED, WHITE, and BLUE.</p>\n<p>The Facts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Mayor Durand REFUSED to fulfill his faithful duty to the people, in allowing the culturally confused Mekhanites to establish places of public worship, siding with sub-let salvage over red-blooded men of the <em>right</em> caliber!</li>\n<li>Mayor Durand REFUSED to relent on his condemnation of the patriotic protectors of the Political Profiling Unit of the EPD, the ONLY ally Eberstrom has against seditious socialism!</li>\n<li>Mayor Durand SUPPORTED the pro-pinko policies of the GOC, who permissively placates Soviet Russia!</li>\n<li>Mayor Durand INSULTED the leader of the Vigilantes who saved the city from certain wacko-rule of the Bolshevik variety \u2014 and to his face, no less!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That last, lads and ladies, is of particular concern to all good gangsters of the casinos and barrooms in recent days, primarily due to the victim's illustrious pedigree: Mr. Benny MacDougall, 55, was the chairman of the Vigilante board that maintained order in the city during the War. Mr. MacDougall was also the brother of an elder statesmen of the Underworld, Jimmy MacDougall, who was Benny's main backer as Chairman. Together they kept Eberstrom safe when the EPD was EP-DEAD, when Feverish-Fifth columns lurked around every corner, and when unrest had unraveled the upper-class lifestyle the common people enjoyed. They did such a dandy job, that the city fathers decided to name a holiday after them - Vigilante Day, a <em>dis</em>orderly celebration for orderly patriots!</p>\n<p>But not according to Durand! During the Vigilante Day dinner - an annual dinner held on November 2nd, wherein Old Vigilantes and their families mingle with the prosperous pinheads both old and new - Mr. Durand accused the MacDougall brothers of criminal acts, crazy underworld shenanigans, and being all around b-a-a-ad boys. The MacDougalls, being men of <em>high</em> character, did not dignify the attacks with a response.</p>\n<p>Following the dinner, Durand had this to say to the embarrassingly endangered <em>Eberstrom Times</em>: \"Mr. MacDougall and his brother oversaw the creation of a regime that still keeps the people of this city gripped in terror. Gangsterism was brought from the street corner to city hall on their watch, with their approval. To not speak of the horrors that Mr. MacDougall was involved in would be to undermine the very foundation of our democratic system based on tolerance and pluralism.\"</p>\n<p>Big Boo Blues from Mr. Durand! Sad his crazed comrades weren't allowed to run the city during the war!</p>\n<p>People are whispering, tongues are a-wagging - Mr. Durand's good standing in the eyes of the people is perilously plunging into the dirt. We at <em>Privileged Info</em> stand in agreement with such pitiful people, hopelessly hampered by lefty loonies. But we disagree with our righteously <em>right</em> friends who believe Mr. Durand as <em>only</em> politically maladroit for this. We suspect another deeper, darker reason - but what could it be? What could make a man lash out against his betters in such a fashion?</p>\n<p>Maybe it's because Dummy Durand's fantastically foolish plans for taxes on casinos was voted down in the Council chamber at 2-1 against?</p>\n<p>Or maybe it was Dutiful Durand being recorded caustically castrating his brother, <em>Disloyal</em> Durand, for running out on his wife? (Who could forget that <em>wonderful</em> quote: \"You couldn't even wait until <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">after</span> I left office to destroy your life?\")</p>\n<p>Or - perhaps, perhaps? - it's something so scandalous, something so savage that even Mr. Durand's Kremlin handlers shy away from?</p>\n<p>That, though, remains <em>Privileged Info</em> \u2014 until next month's issue!</p>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"Sid, it was cheap.\"</p>\n<p>Finlay's feet were on the desk. He was leaning back and forth in his chair - fine leather. He said it was made out of alligator skin.</p>\n<p>\"Sid? Sid, you fuckin' listing to me?\"</p>\n<p>Sidney blinked, took a deep breathe, yawned. He nodded, trying his best to wrench his eyes open. \"You could say that, yeah,\" he said.</p>\n<p>Finlay took a piece of paper and smacked it against Sidney's head. He barely reacted.</p>\n<p>\"It was a goddamn cheap way to end the piece, and you know it.\"</p>\n<p>\"I didn't have much to work with.\"</p>\n<p>\"You got <em>plenty</em> to fucking work with!\"</p>\n<p>Sidney yawned. He leaned back in the folding chair in front of Finlay's desk. Finlay was too cheap to afford any other ones. It also gave his employees another good reason to not be called in.</p>\n<p>\"Nothing that hasn't been done a million times already, sir.\"</p>\n<p>\"Don't patronize me with your attempts at being servile.\"</p>\n<p>\"I am feeling assertive today, sir.\"</p>\n<p>Finlay smacked Sidney again, this time with a big wad of papers think enough to actually make him wince.</p>\n<p>\"I gave you plenty of material. I gave you ten testimonies from those intimately involved with the Frenchmen. Two of them are sworn men of the cloth!\"</p>\n<p>\"They also said that our Mayor was the whore of Babylon made manifest.\"</p>\n<p>\"Perhaps he was.\"</p>\n<p>\"Those two priests were also ex-communicated after doing an exorcism without papal permission. Or parental.\"</p>\n<p>Finlay smacked Sidney again with the paper-wad. This time, it hurt enough that Sidney grabbed it, then threw it against the wall behind Finlay. It collided with various glass trinkets. They fell, shattered. Finlay didn't react.</p>\n<p>\"That will come out of your paycheck.\"</p>\n<p>Sidney laughed. \"And here I was expecting a pink slip. \"</p>\n<p>\"If you follow up on your piece, you won't get one.\"</p>\n<p>\"All that shit you gave me would get us in court.\"</p>\n<p>\"You aren't a lawyer.\"</p>\n<p>\"I've talked to one, unlike you.\"</p>\n<p>\"And a lotta good it did you.\"</p>\n<p>Sidney bawled his fist, felt his fingernails digging into his skin.</p>\n<p>Finlay cleared his throat, straightened his tie, got up. \"From now on, this is your only assignment for this paper. The more details that could darken our dear Mayor's lovely public image, the better.\"</p>\n<p>Sidney stood up as well. It was only then that he realized his hands were sweating. He wiped them on his jeans, then stuck them in his pockets. \"And how do you suppose I do that, <em>sir</em>?\"</p>\n<p>Finlay went to the door, opened it, walked out. Sidney followed, coming to an outer office area. Desks and cubicles dotted the place, quiet distant from one another, all currently unoccupied. Sidney followed Finlay down the hall, outside, to the parking lot.</p>\n<p>\"I hear from some close friends of the paper that Mr. Durand will be out of town for a day or so to meet with some G-men in Washington.\"</p>\n<p>Sidney smirked when it clicked. \"Ah. Would any of those 'close friends' happen to have someone on the Mayor's guard detail, perchance?\"</p>\n<p>\"In your case, an old one. Sergeant Pierce.\"</p>\n<p>\"The detective? From Traffic? Why?</p>\n<p>Finlay got to the front of the building, put on his coat.</p>\n<p>\"I don't know, Sid. Why don't you ask him when you see him?\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Sidney got in his car, put his head on the wheel, took a moment to breathe. He took out a cigarette, unrolled the window, lit it, blew rings out. He looked at the <em>Privileged Info</em> building, a two story with Finlay's apartment on top. The parking lot was small and compact, a necessity in Eberstrom.</p>\n<p>Sidney took a drag, blew out. He looked up to the sky. It was a strange blue-pink hue. The gradient would change depending on time and relative location: blue-pink/black for day/night, pink hues increasing the farther west you go. And stars at night, no less!</p>\n<p>When he first moved to Eberstrom, Sidney thought he'd never get tired of seeing it. The first night, he stared for at least an hour, pointing out the constellations. They weren't real, of course, but being a magical city had its perks. But they felt real to him, then, so familiar, familiar enough that it hurt to think about.</p>\n<p>Now, though, he just looked up when he wanted to avoid things.</p>\n<p>Like Sergeant Pierce.</p>\n<p><em>Why don't you ask him when you see him?</em></p>\n<p>I won't cause he's a dipshit, Sidney thought. Cause he's a dirty cop who gets drunk on duty. Cause he's a blabber mouth. Cause he likes hurting people.</p>\n<p>Sidney looked at his watch - 8:29 on a Thursday night.</p>\n<p>That meant that he was probably drinking at the Carter Corral.</p>\n<p>Sidney threw the cigarette out, lit another. He looked himself in the mirror: 39 years old, thin rimmed glasses, big bags under his eyes. He looked much older than 39 - he looked like he was in his late 40s. Congress could do that to a man.</p>\n<p><em>And a lotta good it did you.</em></p>\n<p>He was transported from Now to Then. 1947 - a lifetime ago. Sid the Muckraker was Sid the Screenwriter and he was good at it. He made enough to feed himself and have a nice roof over his head. He had big dreams. He was going to make it big. Bigger than he ever had a right to be - from the hills of Alabama to the City of Angels was a long way to go. Things were going right.</p>\n<p>Then the hearings.</p>\n<p>Then Richard Nixon.</p>\n<p>Then the blacklist.</p>\n<p>Then Now.</p>\n<p>Now was writing crank pieces. Now was writing and reporting on the dirty laundry of others. Now was red-baiting and peddling conspiracies and hate. Now was bad. Now was shit.</p>\n<p>He threw the cigarette out. He looked at his watch - 8:37.</p>\n<p>Fuck it.</p>\n<p>He put the car into drive and peeled out of the parking lot.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Sidney drove into the parking lot of Carter Corral fifteen minutes later. Loud noise bled outside, and the neon sign's purple hurt his eyes. Security watched him go by without a care in the world. They were armed. It was a Marshall, Carter and Dark affiliated establishment, after all.</p>\n<p>Men were playing at tables and milling about. Some were at the bar drinking. The lights were brighter inside, and the music louder. A stage was visible to the right of the entrance. A girl in a cowboy hat and blue jeans was singing while men whooped and hollered below.</p>\n<p>Sidney went to the bar, and immediately recognized Pierce. He was near a booth in the back. A bunch of men were there - all Pierce's cop friends. They were laughing and making a ruckus. Sidney made his way to the bar, in sight of Pierce.</p>\n<p>Pierce saw him. Pierce stopped laughing, said something to the cops, and got out of the booth - and made his way over to Sidney, sat next to him.</p>\n<p>\"Well, now, what's my favorite commie doing now?\"</p>\n<p>Sidney ignored him, called the bartender over. \"I heard you got a new job.\"</p>\n<p>\"You heard right.\"</p>\n<p>\"You wanna tell me about it?\"</p>\n<p>\"If you pick up my tab.\"</p>\n<p>\"You'll get a lot more than free shots if you play your cards rights.\"</p>\n<p>\"Is Mr. Finlay getting a hard-on for Durand again?\"</p>\n<p>Sidney nodded. Pierce laughed. The bartender came over, asked what they wanted. Sidney, straight whiskey; Pierce, straight vodka.</p>\n<p>\"I always knew you had a bit of the South still left in you,\" Pierce said, laughing.</p>\n<p>\"Mr. Durand.\"</p>\n<p>Pierce rolled his eyes, swallowed his shot. Didn't even flinch when he began.</p>\n<p>\"The department needed an eye on our mutual friend Mr. Durand. They decided I was the right man for the job.\"</p>\n<p>\"You?\"</p>\n<p>\"What makes that so surprising?\"</p>\n<p>\"I'd never make you for a spy.\"</p>\n<p>Pierce grinned. \"There's a lot you don't know I'm capable of.\"</p>\n<p>Sidney stifled the shiver down his spine.</p>\n<p>\"I'm surprised the mayor accepted you. You know how he feels about the boys in blue.\"</p>\n<p>\"They had a whole story concocted for me. Imagine: a dirty cop goes clean, quits the force, recommits to his faith, all the while helping the city's first clean mayor. Pretty good, right?\"</p>\n<p>\"It suits you.\"</p>\n<p>\"I hate it. I go to mass everyday and have to be sober for work.\"</p>\n<p>\"Except tonight.\"</p>\n<p>\"Every man's got a weakness. Even you.\"</p>\n<p>\"And what would mine be, exactly?\"</p>\n<p>\"A desire for a good story.\"</p>\n<p>Sidney leaned in. \"Do you think you got one?\"</p>\n<p>Pierce looked back, making sure no one was looking. He then turned back. \"I've been his personal guard for six weeks. I 'quit' two weeks before that. I boo-hooed about my pension and civil rights. I told him how when I first joined the force, my partner arrested this guy making a ruckus in front of one of MacDougall's joints, and how he palmed us five hundred a piece to put him the hospital. Said it made me so sick I gave it all to the Church.\"</p>\n<p>\"Nice story. Is it true?\"</p>\n<p>\"I spent it on booze and whores. I consider it a better form of absolution than the Church pew.\"</p>\n<p>\"Do you have anything juicy?\"</p>\n<p>\"He's Catholic and uptight. He doesn't cheat on his wife and he doesn't let the nanny raise his kids. He believes the shit he says on that podium. He's a bad liar and he's terrified of being Mayor. He's a real bleeding-heart, Sid. You'd like him.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'll make sure to cry when we gut him politically.\"</p>\n<p>Pierce yucked. He ordered two shots, gulped one down. Sidney watched while he sipped his whiskey.</p>\n<p>\"Juice, Pierce.\"</p>\n<p>\"So,\" Pierce begins, sucking down the third shot. \"That's the best I can get without letting you in to his place.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, could you?\"</p>\n<p>\"Huh? Could I what?\"</p>\n<p>\"Get me into his office.\"</p>\n<p>\"I couldn't get you into the Mayor's office like that, there's \u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"I mean for his personal office. The stuff we're looking for won't be in City Hall, I'm sure.\"</p>\n<p>Pierce glanced down, eyes locking, finally understanding.</p>\n<p>\"Ah. Yeah. Yeah I can do that. But you gotta do <em>me</em> a favor.\"</p>\n<p>\"Such as?\"</p>\n<p>\"You put in a good word for me with Mr. Finlay. If I keep <em>this</em> job up, I can get onto Vice in a year or two. I can get him some <em>reaaaaaal</em> good stuff then.\"</p>\n<p>\"Anything else?\"</p>\n<p>\"Five thousand cold, obviously.\"</p>\n<p>\"Uh huh.\"</p>\n<p>\"And one more thing.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes?\"</p>\n<p>\"You get me in touch with Mr. Stanley.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh for fucks sake -\"</p>\n<p>Sidney made a move to back away. Pierce grabbed his shoulder, forced him to sit down. He felt the man's fingers pierce into his back.</p>\n<p>\"Don't walk away, <em>we were having a talk.\"</em></p>\n<p>Pierce let his grip loosen. Sidney sat back down, massaging his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\"I haven't talked to Stanley in years.\"</p>\n<p>\"You got his number, don't you?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, but -\"</p>\n<p>\"You put me in touch and the Mayor's place is yours.\"</p>\n<p>\"Pierce, do you honestly think he'll say yes? Do you honestly think he'd want a cop like <em>you</em> on his payroll as an actor?\"</p>\n<p>\"They hire reds and queers. Surely they'll let a upright Christian man in.\"</p>\n<p>Sidney sighed. \"Fine. I'll do it. But it better be good.\"</p>\n<p>Pierce yucked. \"Trust me. Besides, I'd love to see that little liberal geek go down.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Sidney called the boss from a payphone across the street. Finlay was annoyed.</p>\n<p>Sidney told him about Pierce - Pierce was their in. They were looking at the motherload.</p>\n<p>Finlay went quiet, chewing the information over.</p>\n<p>\"This is\u2026.good,\" Finlay said. Sidney could imagine him counting the dollar bills. \"That is good indeed.\"</p>\n<p>\"When does the Mayor leave town?\"</p>\n<p>\"On Saturday. I don't know when he'll be back, maybe by Monday morning, Monday night at the latest.\"</p>\n<p>\"I think we can manage to get it done in that time.\"</p>\n<p>\"And write up a quick surprise issue of <em>Privileged Info</em> by Saturday?\"</p>\n<p>\"If all things go according to plan, it'll be done by Wednesday, sir.\"</p>\n<p>\"Don't call me sir, it's fucking patronizing.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm feeling assertive today, sir.\"</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p><a class=\"newpage\" href=\"/red-trash\">Red Trash</a> \u00bb</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/damned-and-depraved\">DAMNED AND DEPRAVED</a>\" by Zer0Ne0phyte , from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Any reader of this paper knows that that was //quite// an event (one this paper salaciously documented!). But, to the misfortunate of all loyal lovers of liberty, it appears that Mayor Durand and his down-ballot allies skewer towards the RED as opposed to the RED, WHITE, and BLUE. \n\n\n\nThe Facts: \n\n# Mayor Durand REFUSED to fulfill his faithful duty to the people, in allowing the culturally confused Mekhanites to establish places of public worship, siding with sub-let salvage over red-blooded men of the //right// caliber!\n\n# Mayor Durand REFUSED to relent on his condemnation of the patriotic protectors of the Political Profiling Unit of the EPD, the ONLY ally Eberstrom has against seditious socialism! \n\n# Mayor Durand SUPPORTED the pro-pinko policies of the GOC, who permissively placates Soviet Russia!\n\n# Mayor Durand INSULTED the leader of the Vigilantes who saved the city from certain wacko-rule of the Bolshevik variety -- and to his face, no less!\n\n\n\nThat last, lads and ladies, is of particular concern to all good gangsters of the casinos and barrooms in recent days, primarily due to the victim's illustrious pedigree: Mr. Benny MacDougall, 55, was the chairman of the Vigilante board that maintained order in the city during the War. Mr. MacDougall was also the brother of an elder statesmen of the Underworld, Jimmy MacDougall,\u00a0\u00a0who was Benny's main backer as Chairman. Together they kept Eberstrom safe when the EPD was EP-DEAD, when Feverish-Fifth columns lurked around every corner, and when unrest had unraveled the upper-class lifestyle the common people enjoyed. They did such a dandy job, that the city fathers decided to name a holiday after them - Vigilante Day, a //dis//orderly celebration for orderly patriots!\n\n\n\nBut not according to Durand! During the Vigilante Day dinner - an annual dinner held on November 2nd, wherein Old Vigilantes and their families mingle with the prosperous pinheads both old and new -\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Durand accused the MacDougall brothers of criminal acts, crazy underworld shenanigans, and being all around b-a-a-ad boys. The MacDougalls, being men of //high// character, did not dignify the attacks with a response. \n\n\n\nFollowing the dinner, Durand had this to say to the embarrassingly endangered //Eberstrom Times//: \"Mr. MacDougall and his brother oversaw the creation of a regime that still keeps the people of this city gripped in terror. Gangsterism was brought from the street corner to city hall on their watch, with their approval. To not speak of the horrors that Mr. MacDougall was involved in would be to undermine the very foundation of our democratic system based on tolerance and pluralism.\"\n\n\n\nBig Boo Blues from Mr. Durand! Sad his crazed comrades weren't allowed to run the city during the war! \n\n\n\nPeople are whispering, tongues are a-wagging - Mr. Durand's good standing in the eyes of the people is perilously plunging into the dirt. We at //Privileged Info// stand in agreement with such pitiful people, hopelessly hampered by lefty loonies. But we disagree with our righteously //right// friends who believe Mr. Durand as //only// politically maladroit for this. We suspect another deeper, darker reason - but what could it be? What could make a man lash out against his betters in such a fashion?\n\n\n\nMaybe it's because Dummy Durand's fantastically foolish plans for taxes on casinos was voted down in the Council chamber at 2-1 against?\n\n\n\nOr maybe it was Dutiful Durand being recorded caustically castrating his brother, //Disloyal// Durand, for running out on his wife? (Who could forget that //wonderful// quote: \"You couldn't even wait until __after__ I left office to destroy your life?\")\n\n\n\nOr - perhaps, perhaps? - it's something so scandalous, something so savage that even Mr. Durand's Kremlin handlers shy away from? \n\n\n\nThat, though, remains //Privileged Info// -- until next month's issue!\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n\n\n-----------\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Sid, it was cheap.\"\n\n\n\nFinlay's feet were on the desk. He was leaning back and forth in his chair - fine leather. He said it was made out of alligator skin. \n\n\n\n\"Sid? Sid, you fuckin' listing to me?\" \n\n\n\nSidney blinked, took a deep breathe, yawned. He nodded, trying his best to wrench his eyes open. \"You could say that, yeah,\" he said. \n\n\n\nFinlay took a piece of paper and smacked it against Sidney's head. He barely reacted. \n\n\n\n\"It was a goddamn cheap way to end the piece, and you know it.\" \n\n\n\n\"I didn't have much to work with.\" \n\n\n\n\"You got //plenty// to fucking work with!\" \n\n\n\nSidney yawned. He leaned back in the folding chair in front of Finlay's desk. Finlay was too cheap to afford any other ones. It also gave his employees another good reason to not be called in.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Nothing that hasn't been done a million times already, sir.\" \n\n\n\n\"Don't patronize me with your attempts at being servile.\" \n\n\n\n\"I am feeling assertive today, sir.\" \n\n\n\nFinlay smacked Sidney again, this time with a big wad of papers think enough to actually make him wince. \n\n\n\n\"I gave you plenty of material. I gave you ten testimonies from those intimately involved with the Frenchmen. Two of them are sworn men of the cloth!\"\n\n\n\n\"They also said that our Mayor was the whore of Babylon made manifest.\" \n\n\n\n\"Perhaps he was.\" \n\n\n\n\"Those two priests were also ex-communicated after doing an exorcism without papal permission. Or parental.\" \n\n\n\nFinlay smacked Sidney again with the paper-wad. This time, it hurt enough that Sidney grabbed it, then threw it against the wall behind Finlay. It collided with various glass trinkets. They fell, shattered. Finlay didn't react.\n\n\n\n\"That will come out of your paycheck.\" \n\n\n\nSidney laughed. \"And here I was expecting a pink slip. \" \n\n\n\n\"If you follow up on your piece, you won't get one.\" \n\n\n\n\"All that shit you gave me would get us in court.\"\n\n\n\n\"You aren't a lawyer.\" \n\n\n\n\"I've talked to one, unlike you.\"\n\n\n\n\"And a lotta good it did you.\"\n\n\n\nSidney bawled his fist, felt his fingernails digging into his skin. \n\n\n\nFinlay cleared his throat, straightened his tie, got up. \"From now on, this is your only assignment for this paper. The more details that could darken our dear Mayor's lovely public image, the better.\" \n\n\n\nSidney stood up as well. It was only then that he realized his hands were sweating. He wiped them on his jeans, then stuck them in his pockets. \"And how do you suppose I do that, //sir//?\" \n\n\n\nFinlay went to the door, opened it, walked out. Sidney followed, coming to an outer office area. Desks and cubicles dotted the place, quiet distant from one another, all currently unoccupied. Sidney followed Finlay down the hall, outside, to the parking lot. \n\n\n\n\"I hear from some close friends of the paper that Mr. Durand will be out of town for a day or so to meet with some G-men in Washington.\" \n\n\n\nSidney smirked when it clicked. \"Ah. Would any of those 'close friends' happen to have someone on the Mayor's guard detail, perchance?\"\n\n\n\n\"In your case, an old one. Sergeant Pierce.\" \n\n\n\n\"The detective? From Traffic? Why? \n\n\n\nFinlay got to the front of the building, put on his coat. \n\n\n\n\"I don't know, Sid. Why don't you ask him when you see him?\" \n\n\n\n\n\n--------\n\n\n\nSidney got in his car, put his head on the wheel, took a moment to breathe. He took out a cigarette, unrolled the window, lit it, blew rings out. He looked at the //Privileged Info// building, a two story with Finlay's apartment on top. The parking lot was small and compact, a necessity in Eberstrom. \n\n\n\nSidney took a drag, blew out. He looked up to the sky. It was a strange blue-pink hue. The gradient would change depending on time and relative location: blue-pink/black for day/night, pink hues increasing the farther west you go. And stars at night, no less!\n\n\n\nWhen he first moved to Eberstrom, Sidney thought he'd never get tired of seeing it. The first night, he stared for at least an hour, pointing out the constellations. They weren't real, of course, but being a magical city had its perks. But they felt real to him, then, so familiar, familiar enough that it hurt to think about. \n\n\n\nNow, though, he just looked up when he wanted to avoid things. \n\n\n\nLike Sergeant Pierce. \n\n\n\n//Why don't you ask him when you see him?// \n\n\n\nI won't cause he's a dipshit, Sidney thought. Cause he's a dirty cop who gets drunk on duty. Cause he's a blabber mouth. Cause he likes hurting people. \n\n\n\nSidney looked at his watch - 8:29 on a Thursday night. \n\n\n\nThat meant that he was probably drinking at the Carter Corral. \n\n\n\nSidney threw the cigarette out, lit another. He looked himself in the mirror: 39 years old, thin rimmed glasses, big bags under his eyes. He looked much older than 39 - he looked like he was in his late 40s. Congress could do that to a man.\n\n\n\n//And a lotta good it did you.//\n\n\n\nHe was transported from Now to Then. 1947 - a lifetime ago.

He looked at his watch - 8:37. \n\n\n\nFuck it. \n\n\n\nHe put the car into drive and peeled out of the parking lot. \n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nSidney drove into the parking lot of Carter Corral fifteen minutes later.

A girl in a cowboy hat and blue jeans was singing while men whooped and hollered below. \n\n\n\nSidney went to the bar, and immediately recognized Pierce. He was near a booth in the back. A bunch of men were there - all Pierce's cop friends. They were laughing and making a ruckus. Sidney made his way to the bar, in sight of Pierce. \n\n\n\nPierce saw him. Pierce stopped laughing, said something to the cops, and got out of the booth - and made his way over to Sidney, sat next to him. \n\n\n\n\"Well, now, what's my favorite commie doing now?\" \n\n\n\nSidney ignored him, called the bartender over. \"I heard you got a new job.\" \n\n\n\n\"You heard right.\" \n\n\n\n\"You wanna tell me about it?\" \n\n\n\n\"If you pick up my tab.\" \n\n\n\n\"You'll get a lot more than free shots if you play your cards rights.\"\n\n\n\n\"Is Mr. Finlay getting a hard-on for Durand again?\" \n\n\n\nSidney nodded. Pierce laughed. The bartender came over, asked what they wanted. Sidney, straight whiskey; Pierce, straight vodka. \n\n\n\n\"I always knew you had a bit of the South still left in you,\" Pierce said, laughing. \n\n\n\n\"Mr. Durand.\" \n\n\n\nPierce rolled his eyes, swallowed his shot. Didn't even flinch when he began. \n\n\n\n\"The department needed an eye on our mutual friend Mr. Durand. They decided I was the right man for the job.\" \n\n\n\n\"You?\" \n\n\n\n\"What makes that so surprising?\" \n\n\n\n\"I'd never make you for a spy.\" \n\n\n\nPierce grinned. \"There's a lot you don't know I'm capable of.\" \n\n\n\nSidney stifled the shiver down his spine. \n\n\n\n\"I'm surprised the mayor accepted you. You know how he feels about the boys in blue.\" \n\n\n\n\"They had a whole story concocted for me. Imagine: a dirty cop goes clean, quits the force, recommits to his faith, all the while helping the city's first clean mayor. Pretty good, right?\" \n\n\n\n\"It suits you.\" \n\n\n\n\"I hate it. I go to mass everyday and have to be sober for work.\" \n\n\n\n\"Except tonight.\" \n\n\n\n\"Every man's got a weakness. Even you.\"\n\n\n\n\"And what would mine be, exactly?\"\n\n\n\n\"A desire for a good story.\" \n\n\n\nSidney leaned in. \"Do you think you got one?\" \n\n\n\nPierce looked back, making sure no one was looking. He then turned back. \"I've been his personal guard for six weeks. I 'quit' two weeks before that. I boo-hooed about my pension and civil rights. I told him how when I first joined the force, my partner arrested this guy making a ruckus in front of one of MacDougall's joints, and how he palmed us five hundred a piece to put him the hospital. Said it made me so sick I gave it all to the Church.\"\n\n\n\n\"Nice story. Is it true?\"\n\n\n\n\"I spent it on booze and whores. I consider it a better form of absolution than the Church pew.\" \n\n\n\n\"Do you have anything juicy?\" \n\n\n\n\"He's Catholic and uptight. He doesn't cheat on his wife and he doesn't let the nanny raise his kids. He believes the shit he says on that podium. He's a bad liar and he's terrified of being Mayor.\u00a0\u00a0He's a real bleeding-heart, Sid. You'd like him.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'll make sure to cry when we gut him politically.\" \n\n\n\nPierce yucked. He ordered two shots, gulped one down. Sidney watched while he sipped his whiskey. \n\n\n\n\"Juice, Pierce.\" \n\n\n\n\"So,\" Pierce begins, sucking down the third shot. \"That's the best I can get without letting you in to his place.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, could you?\" \n\n\n\n\"Huh? Could I what?\" \n\n\n\n\"Get me into his office.\" \n\n\n\n\"I couldn't get you into the Mayor's office like that, there's --\" \n\n\n\n\"I mean for his personal office. The stuff we're looking for won't be in City Hall, I'm sure.\" \n\n\n\nPierce glanced down, eyes locking, finally understanding. \n\n\n\n\"Ah. Yeah. Yeah I can do that. But you gotta do //me// a favor.\" \n\n\n\n\"Such as?\" \n\n\n\n\"You put in a good word for me with Mr. Finlay. If I keep //this// job up, I can get onto Vice in a year or two. I can get him some //reaaaaaal// good stuff then.\"\n\n\n\n\"Anything else?\" \n\n\n\n\"Five thousand cold, obviously.\"\n\n\n\n\"Uh huh.\"\n\n\n\n\"And one more thing.\" \n\n\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\n\n\"You get me in touch with Mr. Stanley.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh for fucks sake -\" \n\n\n\nSidney made a move to back away. Pierce grabbed his shoulder, forced him to sit down. He felt the man's fingers pierce into his back. \n\n\n\n\"Don't walk away, //we were having a talk.\"//\n\n\n\nPierce let his grip loosen. Sidney sat back down, massaging his shoulder. \n\n\n\n\"I haven't talked to Stanley in years.\" \n\n\n\n\"You got his number, don't you?\" \n\n\n\n\"Yes, but -\" \n\n\n\n\"You put me in touch and the Mayor's place is yours.\" \n\n\n\n\"Pierce, do you honestly think he'll say yes? Do you honestly think he'd want a cop like //you// on his payroll as an actor?\" \n\n\n\n\"They hire reds and queers. Surely they'll let a upright Christian man in.\" \n\n\n\nSidney sighed. \"Fine. I'll do it. But it better be good.\" \n\n\n\nPierce yucked. \"Trust me. Besides, I'd love to see that little liberal geek go down.\" \n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n\nSidney called the boss from a payphone across the street. Finlay was annoyed. \n\n\n\nSidney told him about Pierce - Pierce was their in. They were looking at the motherload. \n\n\n\nFinlay went quiet, chewing the information over. \n\n\n\n\"This is....good,\" Finlay said. Sidney could imagine him counting the dollar bills. \"That is good indeed.\" \n\n\n\n\"When does the Mayor leave town?\" \n\n\n\n\"On Saturday. I don't know when he'll be back, maybe by Monday morning, Monday night at the latest.\" \n\n\n\n\"I think we can manage to get it done in that time.\" \n\n\n\n\"And write up a quick surprise issue of //Privileged Info// by Saturday?\" \n\n\n\n\"If all things go according to plan, it'll be done by Wednesday, sir.\"\n\n\n\n\"Don't call me sir, it's fucking patronizing.\" \n\n\n\n\"I'm feeling assertive today, sir.\"\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n[[[Red Trash]]] \u00bb\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["red-trash", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "tale"], "title": "DAMNED AND DEPRAVED - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/damned-and-depraved", "year": 2024}, "dr-kondraki-cut-up-while-thinking": {"created_at": "2024-01-10T21:52:00", "creator": "MontagueETC", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "MontagueETC", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/montagueetc", "comment": "", "date": "2024-01-10T21:52:00"}, {"author": "MontagueETC", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/montagueetc", "comment": "Uploaded file \"dotted-line.png\".", "date": "2024-01-10T21:53:00"}, {"author": "MontagueETC", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/montagueetc", "comment": "Uploaded file \"dotted-line-bottom.png\".", "date": "2024-01-10T21:53:00"}, {"author": "MontagueETC", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/montagueetc", "comment": "Uploaded file \"dotted-line-top.png\".", "date": "2024-01-10T21:53:00"}, {"author": "MontagueETC", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/montagueetc", "comment": "Uploaded file \"MonarchsandMaestros.png\".", "date": "2024-01-10T21:54:00"}, {"author": "MontagueETC", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/montagueetc", "comment": "Uploaded file \"DKCUWT-Thumbnail.png\".", "date": "2024-01-10T21:54:00"}, {"author": "MontagueETC", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/montagueetc", "comment": "Uploaded file \"act1.png\".", "date": "2024-01-10T21:54:00"}, {"author": "MontagueETC", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/montagueetc", "comment": "", "date": "2024-01-10T21:55:00"}, {"author": "MontagueETC", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/montagueetc", "comment": "Added tags: bittersweet, doctor-kondraki, draven-kondraki, lgbtq, surrealist-fiction.

KONDRAKI CUT UP WHILE THINKING</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cut-up\">\n\n<p>About a month after <a href=\"/scp-7408\">the bullet and the butterflies</a>, you experience your first coherent thought.</p>\n<p><em>My ass itches like crazy,</em> you think.</p>\n\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"cut-up\">\n\n<p>First, there is nothing.</p>\n<p>No light or dark, noise or silence, presence or absence. There is\u2026 sensation. Touch, sight, sound. But each is divorced from comprehension. The chill breath of conditioned air on the body's scalp, the pristine vacuity of the medical chamber, the dull roar of monitoring equipment. You cannot understand it. You reach and reach but it slips through your fingers every time.</p>\n<p>An interval of time passes\u2014an eon, maybe, or a few minutes.</p>\n\n<p>The body does not rediscover movement so much as it falls into it; a jolt that passes through the chest and shoulders in reaction to a sudden neurochemical bloom. When it tries to move again, something goes strange in that nebulous space between <em>stimulus</em> and <em>response</em>. The body tries to open its mouth and finds itself wiggling its toes. It tries to raise its arm and the left side of its face goes tense. It tries to turn its head, to close its hands, to throw itself from the bed and watches great streaks of color carousel around the room.</p>\n<p>Twitching uncontrollably, the body breathes in, then out. Its heart hums a steady tune. So at least that still works.</p>\n\n<p>Words begin to coalesce.</p>\n<p>The words are insubstantial, wispy things, floating along the edges of your cognition like threadbare clouds. They too are beyond your comprehension\u2014you know only the slight shadows they cast as they pass overhead.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p><em>\u2014creeps me out, how he's always staring like\u2014</em></p>\n<p><em>\u2014vitals are steady, you can lower the dosage to\u2014</em></p>\n<p><em>\u2014swear those things will start strobing one day and give me a seizure\u2014</em></p>\n<p><em>\u2014practically vegetative but this brain activity is\u2014</em></p>\n<p><em>\u2014have you replaced the bedpan yet?</em></p>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p>Though the body cannot see it, the sun inches across the sky. Shadows shift, then grow. The land remains the same, but is changed by the falling light.</p>\n\n<p>Time passes. Thoughts cohere. The body's ass continues to itch.</p>\n<p>Somewhere very far away, a question is asked.</p>\n\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"cut-up\">\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h1 id=\"toc0\"><span>ARE WE \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 YET?</span></h1>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"cut-up\">\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h4 id=\"toc1\"><span>SCP-7408-B INTERVIEW LOG 07</span></h4>\n</div>\n<p><strong>YOU:</strong> What was that?</p>\n<p><strong>DOCTOR:</strong> I said, \"how are we feeling today?\"</p>\n<p><strong>YOU:</strong> Right.

You do not know the woman's name, but you're pretty certain the body has seen her in the staff cafeteria before, nattering on about whatever it is your colleagues talk about when they're not working.</p>\n<p>This time, when the woman speaks the words, you comprehend.</p>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h4 id=\"toc2\"><span>SCP-7408-B INTERVIEW LOG 01</span></h4>\n</div>\n<p><strong>DOCTOR:</strong> Do you understand what I'm saying?</p>\n<p><em>The body tries to speak, but all that comes out is a rasping wheeze. How long has it been since it last spoke?</em></p>\n<p><em>After the woman holds a cup of water to the body's lips, you try again.</em></p>\n<p><strong>YOU:</strong> Yes.</p>\n<p><strong>DOCTOR:</strong> Can you give me your name?</p>\n<p><em>You have a name, don't you? All people have names and you're a person. Ergo:</em></p>\n<p><strong>YOU:</strong> Kondraki.</p>\n<p><strong>DOCTOR:</strong> Good. And your first name?</p>\n<p><em>Oh, right, people usually have at least two of those.</em></p>\n<p><strong>YOU:</strong> It's\u2026</p>\n<p><em>You reach for your other name and find\u2014not nothing, exactly. You have the answer. It's here, in the body's head. But the shape of it is changed. It can't be held anymore.</em></p>\n<p><strong>YOU:</strong> I don't know.</p>\n<p><strong>YOU:</strong> What is it?</p>\n<p><em>The woman's expression does something you can't parse before smoothing back into careful stillness. She has bad news.</em></p>\n<p><strong>DOCTOR:</strong> We were hoping you could tell us.</p>\n\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"cut-up\">\n\n<p>When you wake up, sunlight is pouring through the window like molten gold.

It's terrifying how quickly toddlers grow\u2014even after just a handful of months, he looks different. The kid's maybe a few inches taller and someone's given him a haircut.</p>\n<p>He hesitates in the threshold, eyes shining. He doesn't recognize you\u2014and how could he? The body's lost twenty pounds, its hair only beginning to grow back from the pre-brain surgery shave. To his child's eyes, it must look like an uncanny replica of his father, a skeletal parody.</p>\n<p>Or maybe he doesn't remember you at all. He's so young.</p>\n<p><em>Hey, buddy,</em> you manage to croak. <em>I missed you.</em></p>\n<p>Some gossamer strand of emotion seems to break inside him, then, and he tears across the room to bump his head against the body's\u2014 against <em>your</em> ribs. Suspended somewhere between relief and agony, you hold him close as he sobs.</p>\n<p>When they come to take him away, the both of you are long asleep.</p>\n\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"cut-up\">\n\n<p>You see him in one of your favorite bars\u2014the kind where bouncers barely glance at your fake ID when you come in. It's that guy from your photography club. He's older than you, maybe late twenties or early thirties, with olive skin, curly black hair and a stubbly smile. Warmth shoots through you every time he praises one of your photos.</p>\n<p>You've known, ever since you were fourteen and briefly obsessed about Harrison Ford movies, that you like guys. It's just that you've never done anything with those feelings in the five years since, always too scared or ashamed to strike up the nerve. But now? Maybe it's the alcohol buzzing at the base of your skull or maybe you caught him looking at you funny a couple times or maybe nobody's touched you since fucking senior prom\u2014whichever it is, now is different. You tip the rest of your drink down your throat and stagger out of your chair.</p>\n\n<p>The two of you have hardly spoken before, so you introduce yourselves. He says, <em>that's a good name. Memorable.</em> Which is a strange compliment to give, but you're oddly, stupidly flattered by it. You chat like that for a while, until he sort of\u2014looks at you. Leans back, eyes half-lidded.

It's not that difficult, once you learn the trick of it. Like clenching a muscle in your brain.</p>\n<p>You make a game of it. First, you try colors. Blue, yellow, orange. Green.</p>\n<p>Then, shapes. Triangles, cubes, dodecahedrons.</p>\n<p>You move on to more complex subjects, recreating objects from memory, faces from half-forgotten dreams. You try to paint the sea but can't get the hue quite right.</p>\n<p>You pour every waking moment into it, clenching that metaphorical muscle until droning migraines force you to stop.

These were the first words you'd exchanged with the man sat opposite you since you first arrived roughly thirteen seconds ago. Between yourself and the man was a lacquered desk \u2013 upon which \u2013 rested a series of manilla folders. His eyes pore across the folder and you continue observing the man\u2019s tumefied face for any betrayal of cognitive awareness.</p>\n<p>\u2018No,\u2019 the man replies as he hastily reaches for the first folder with grubby fingers. \u2018Is he one of yours?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018They,\u2019 you reply in turn, slapping his sausage-like appendages away from the folder. \u2018And no, they are not.\u2019</p>\n<p>The grotesque man nurses his fingers between cupped hands. His muttered complaints are inaudible beneath the din of halogen bulbs buzzing faintly within the cramped office. Above your heads, a large fan circulates frigid air around the office with a constant whirring and whining. <em>Whir-whine; whine-whir.</em></p>\n<p>\u2018One of mine?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Again, no.\u2019 You smile as you sip at the whiskey provided by the bloated man \u2014 it tastes like bitter regrets. The man's glassy, pale eyes blink like some gigantic confused frog. You watch as blood rushes beneath the surface of his flabby face.</p>\n<p>\u2018Then why would I ever be familiar with them!\u2019 He shouts, his fingers briefly curled into grubby fists gripping at the table's lip.</p>\n<p>You offer an apologetic shrug and your kindest smile. \u2018Just thought you might have been is all.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Well then, how might <em>I</em> help you with this Thorley? Were they involved in some kind of altercation?\u2019 The odoriferous beast smiles thinly \u2014 visibly struggling to conceal his apparent frustration with you.</p>\n<p>\u2018Oh no, nothing like that.\u2019 You reply as a smirk slowly begins to grow across your lips. An inside joke takes seed within your mind and you can't help but stifle a laugh. \u2018It's a rather <em>big</em> story.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Are you insulting me?\u2019 The large man pauses for a brief moment, before gathering his composure and licking his crusted lips. \u2018I feel as though I'm the butt of some cosmic practical joke. Here you are, rudely barging into my office with serious allegations regarding the conduct of an employee who I don't even recognise!</p>\n<p>He pauses again, sipping at his own glass of whiskey and smiling thinly at you. \u2018Now, please try and be reasonable with me, whatever did this Alex Thorley do to cause you such grave concerns?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I heard it all started with a burger.\u2019</p>\n<p>The rotund ogre cries out with rage \u2013 standing up from his desk with some visible effort \u2013 before reaching for the nearest object and sending it flying over your shoulder. The glass figurine of a horse lays shatters upon the carpeted floor behind you.</p>\n<p>\u2018My mistake, it was a bagel.\u2019</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Act II, Scene 13.</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><tt><strong>Department of Unreality, interior-exterior-<em>betweenerior</em>. \u2014 dusk, complacency.</strong></tt></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<p><em><strong>ALEX THORLEY</strong> continues idly tapping away at the keyboard, their fingers brushing against cheap plastic keys the colour of\u2026 beige?</em><sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p><em><strong>ALEX THORLEY</strong></em><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>I\u2019m just going through the motions.

These were the first words you'd exchanged with the man sat opposite you since you first arrived roughly thirteen seconds ago. Between yourself and the man was a lacquered desk \u2013 upon which \u2013 rested a series of manilla folders. His eyes pore across the folder and you continue observing the man\u2019s tumefied face for any betrayal of cognitive awareness.\n\n\n\n\u2018No,\u2019 the man replies as he hastily reaches for the first folder with grubby fingers. \u2018Is he one of yours?\u2019\n\n\n\n\u2018They,\u2019 you reply in turn, slapping his sausage-like appendages away from the folder. \u2018And no, they are not.\u2019\n\n\n\nThe grotesque man nurses his fingers between cupped hands. His muttered complaints are inaudible beneath the din of halogen bulbs buzzing faintly within the cramped office. Above your heads, a large fan circulates frigid air around the office with a constant whirring and whining. //Whir-whine; whine-whir.//\n\n\n\n\u2018One of mine?\u2019\n\n\n\n\u2018Again, no.\u2019 You smile as you sip at the whiskey provided by the bloated man \u2014 it tastes like bitter regrets. The man's glassy, pale eyes blink like some gigantic confused frog. You watch as blood rushes beneath the surface of his flabby face.\n\n\n\n\u2018Then why would I ever be familiar with them!\u2019 He shouts, his fingers briefly curled into grubby fists gripping at the table's lip.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nYou offer an apologetic shrug and your kindest smile. \u2018Just thought you might have been is all.\u2019\n\n\n\n\u2018Well then, how might //I// help you with this Thorley? Were they involved in some kind of altercation?\u2019 The odoriferous beast smiles thinly \u2014 visibly struggling to conceal his apparent frustration with you.\n\n\n\n\u2018Oh no, nothing like that.\u2019 You reply as a smirk slowly begins to grow across your lips. An inside joke takes seed within your mind and you can't help but stifle a laugh. \u2018It's a rather //big// story.\u2019\n\n\n\n\u2018Are you insulting me?\u2019 The large man pauses for a brief moment, before gathering his composure and licking his crusted lips. \u2018I feel as though I'm the butt of some cosmic practical joke. Here you are, rudely barging into my office with serious allegations regarding the conduct of an employee who I don't even recognise!\n\n\n\nHe pauses again, sipping at his own glass of whiskey and smiling thinly at you. \u2018Now, please try and be reasonable with me, whatever did this Alex Thorley do to cause you such grave concerns?\u2019\n\n\n\n\u2018I heard it all started with a burger.\u2019\n\n\n\nThe rotund ogre cries out with rage \u2013 standing up from his desk with some visible effort \u2013 before reaching for the nearest object and sending it flying over your shoulder. The glass figurine of a horse lays shatters upon the carpeted floor behind you.\n\n\n\n\u2018My mistake, it was a bagel.\u2019\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n----\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n= //**Act II, Scene 13.**//\n\n\n\n= {{**Department of Unreality, interior-exterior-//betweenerior//. \u2014 dusk, complacency.**}}\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n//**ALEX THORLEY** continues idly tapping away at the keyboard, their fingers brushing against cheap plastic keys the colour of\u2026 beige?//[[footnote]]Beige?

Small hints of character hang here- a few posters, \u201cThe Rounder\u2019s Parade,\u201d an action movie with heavy anti-authoritarian overtones, a couple bookshelves bolted to the wall, and stacks upon stacks of design documents. Many of these have been extracted from the Wanderer\u2019s Library, but a few have been extracted through other means. A few sit in plastic bags, the blood soaking their pages prevented from affecting the other piles of literature.</p>\n<p>He stands up, taking off the thin blanket and falling out of bed onto the floor. This is a tried and true method to awaken himself. His head knocks against the bedside drawer, and the receiver of the rifle falls against him, tumbling out of the protective case. Instinctively he cradles the receiver, unaware of what he is doing until his fingers embrace the wooden stock, and he awakens himself from an odd thought process he didn\u2019t understand in the first place.</p>\n<p><em>For an experiment\u2026</em></p>\n<p>He gently plugs the neural jack in, connecting his mind with the\u2026 thing inside the receiver.</p>\n<p><strong>I am not a thing.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Yes, but what are you?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Why do I need to answer this? Let me go back to sleep.</strong></p>\n<p><em>You sleep?</em></p>\n<p>Glen stares at the wall, their eyes scanning the window in a regular habit. Outside, a massive circle, with three arrows pointing towards a pentagram with line-art depictions of the world map, looms.</p>\n<p><em>The new world order\u2026</em></p>\n<p><strong>Glen, unplug me. Charge me, dipshit.</strong></p>\n<p><em>How did you learn dipshit?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Magic. I am an evolving consciousness- go read my instruction manual.</strong></p>\n<p>Glen shrugs, unplugging the nueral connector jack and carefully inserting the charging cord. He stretches, and exits the room, their sunken nonchalantly observing the barenss of their kitchen. He shrugs, and encases himself in the fabrics of civilization. His clothing is \u201cnormal.\u201d In what remains of winter, he shields himself with a heavy metal sweatshirt, faded jeans, and Converse shoes of an age incomprehensible to fashionistas. Locking each possible point of entry <em>window, doors, attic</em> and leaves.</p>\n<p>The world has changed, and Glen just lives in it. The Three Arrowed Star overlooks all of them, plastered on posters, advertisements, and billboards. They have simply unleashed themselves from the shadows, showing the tentacles they have emplaced across the entire globe. It took a few years, but some sort of global hierarchy has been established- or has already been established. Glen stares at the massive flag being unfolded across the Luxor, a main point of contact for the Undervegas realm.</p>\n<p><em>Fascist? Bastards? Who knows what to name them.</em></p>\n<p>Glen grins to themselves as people stare at the jet-black uniforms, the branded soldiers staring across the causeway. He knows many of them are undergoing an extreme shift of perspective, an extreme destruction of what they thought was a well-collected set of facts about reality. A living gun is just another oddity in this new world, the world of 1999, the world of global communications.</p>\n<p><em>I wonder what 2000 will being.</em></p>\n<p>Glen shrugs, avoiding the main congestion of humanity and snagging a few large cloth bags worth of groceries and returning home, their eyes beginning to twitch from the constant human contact. They shut the door to their home, unleashing a deep breath and returning to the embrace of their kitchen. They begin to cook themselves a breakfast- onions sauteeing, sausage soaking in garlic-filled oil, and broccolli roasted overtop all of it. He sits down at his homemade dinner table, then stands up again, picking up the now fully charged receiver and inserting the neural jack.</p>\n<p><em>You feeling better?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Yes. Some of my mind shuts down when I get a low battery. Please plug me in overnight- it won\u2019t ruin my battery.</strong></p>\n<p><em>I will do just that.</em></p>\n<p>He puts the receiver down, gently running their hand along the pull-bolt and empty magazine slot.</p>\n<p><strong>Are we\u2026 eating breakfast?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Yes.</em></p>\n<p>Glen begins ea0ting, allowing the food to flow across their taste buds. He savors the spices of the sausage, feeling the slight crunch of the saut\u00e9ed onions, and the broccoli adds a wonderful salty taste from all the spices it absorbed from the stir fry.</p>\n<p><strong>Glen, this is delicious.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Ha, I figured. I was curious if you could contact that part of my body.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Glen, I can contact <em>all</em> of your body.</strong></p>\n<p>He raises an eyebrow.</p>\n<p><strong>Yes, even that one.</strong></p>\n<p>Glen grins, unplugs the receiver, and receives the instruction manual he received from the arms dealer. As the sun slowly arcs across the sky, he reads through the entire thing, Glenda sitting on the dining room table, occasionally squirming in the protein solution. As Glen finishes the manual, he reaches under his sink to retrieve a mini-screwdriver, delicately unplugging the wooden stock and receiver from the brain-tank, isolating it from the rest of the firing mechanisms. He plugs the jacks in again, his vision blurring slightly.</p>\n<p><em>Can you do targeting without the gun?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Perhaps.</strong></p>\n<p>Glen stands up, ripping a piece of paper from the instruction manual and balling it up. An arc appears, the paper clump highlighted in a dull orange. The trashcan lid is encircled in a dark red, and a small trace line covers his vision. With practiced movements he has no experience with, his hand arcs forward, a perfect amount of force propelling the clump into the trashcan with a satisfying thwap.</p>\n<p><em>Yes, you can.

The surroundings slowly change, from run-down apartment buildings to somewhat dilapidated warehouses to barely kempt storefronts, harsh xenon lights illuminating product. Glen scans them, eyes uncommitingly making contact with so many artifices of capitalism, their folds and cheaply manufactured pieces naught but dust to his eyes. Suddenly, his feet stumble as he passes a dress shop, bright pink pastels and neon colorations assaulting his eyes.</p>\n<p><em>Don\u2019t do that!</em></p>\n<p><strong>I like the colors.</strong></p>\n<p>Glen hesitates, staring at the assortment of dresses and shoes, then looking down at his own body. The muscles that he can flex at will, the abdominals cut like canyons, pectorals and shoulders moulded to shoot, forearms blasted by repetitions at the gym. He looks up again, a picture of him wearing a dress and the receiver plastered across his chest in bra flashing across his mind\u2019s eye.</p>\n<p><em>We can choose one after we get the job.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Thank you.</strong></p>\n<p>Glen nods, continuing on his way. In front of him a patrol rounds the corner, gray- and pink-colored combat armor masking their aggressive mentality. He sneaks into the closest alley, waiting for them patiently to pass, then emerges back onto the street, a small bead of sweat dripping down his brow. He now has more than enough reason to avoid the bead-headed men and women, the piece of tech strapped across their helmet programmed to detect any kind of anomalous activity.</p>\n<p><strong>I feel this does not need to be said, but I would prefer not to be taken and dissected.</strong></p>\n<p><em>I will never let that happen to you, Glenda.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Promises, promises, baby.</strong></p>\n<p>Glen grins, finally arriving at the singular apartment complex located on Avelon Avenue. He goes to the entryway, a small glass enclosure with iron bars over the glass, and finds the button labelled 4E, pressing it down.

Crumpling of papers is heard over the microphone. The door unlocks, a harsh ringing buzz coming from the alarm system. Quickly and succinctly, Glen enters the apartment and climbs his way to the apartment door, passing through hallways with peeling paisley paint and utterly horrid upholstery, their eyes slowly scanning the door with \u201c4E\u201d in faded fake bronze numbering.</p>\n<p><strong>Seems safe.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Thank you for your experienced diagnosis.</em></p>\n<p>Glen knocks, once, twice, and thrice, rapping their knuckles against the cheap pine wood, then slowly moves their frame away from the door. It opens, a face that most looks liek an attorney sticking itself out of the partially open frame.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou here for the- Glen?\u201d</p>\n<p>Glen lets loose a thousand lumen smile at the sight of their oldest friend, rushing forward to embrace them, returned in kind with more than a bit of back-patting.</p>\n<p>\u201cGlen!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlan! How\u2019s it going?\u201d</p>\n<p>The two break apart, Alan\u2019s hands lingering on the tank strapped to Glen\u2019s side.</p>\n<p>\u201cGlen? You have some kind of medical disability or some shit?\u201d</p>\n<p>Glen scoffs, moving the folds of their clothing aside to show the tank, the brain stem wriggling in greeting.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m uh\u2026 training my targeting A.I. It\u2019s been an interesting process.\u201d</p>\n<p>Alan shrugs, waving their prosthetic hand to indicate his acceptance of Glen\u2019s entrance into the room. \u201cCome, come, I was hoping I\u2019d pick you up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Glen enters the dilapidated apartment, the threadbare furniture and spartan decorations- excepting the pure blizzard of documentation covering the small coffee table and settee.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis one is a bit of a doozy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh really? I couldn\u2019t even tell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGlen, you\u2019ve always been terrible with sarcasm.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>I agree.</strong></p>\n<p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? I didn\u2019t mean it, Glen.\u201d</p>\n<p>Glen sighs, giving a facsimile of a smile. \u201cNot you, Alan. Not you.\u201d Glen opens the plain brown trenchcoat, showing the swell of the receiver against his chest.</p>\n<p>Alan chuckles, shaking his head and straightening the half-open chambray work shirt, the chest scars visible between the buttons. \u201cI always knew you\u2019d hook yourself up with a sweet girl one day, just didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be a brain in a jar.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>I resent that.</strong></p>\n<p>\u201cShe resents that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Alan\u2019s eyebrows rise desultorily. \u201c\u2019She\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>I\u2019ll need to disconnect you. Sorry.</em></p>\n<p><strong>He seems robophobic anyway.</strong></p>\n<p>Glen grins, reaching up and unplugging the perception jack. \u201cSee? Alone. Now what\u2019s the job.\u201d</p>\n<p>Alan nods, retrieving a manila envelope from between the cushions of the Alan bed unfolded in the middle of the dingy apartment, sliding it across the bumpy surface of the enamel table. Glen walks over to the table, sitting across from Alan, the lose of the targeting display in his vision making him blink. He peruses the folder, the pertinent details standing out.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlan, Alan, Alan\u2026 I didn\u2019t know you delved into politics.\u201d Glen\u2019s fingers slides across the picture of Las Vegas Comptroller Garth Vargas, the eponymous name sprinkling out against his salt-and-pepper beard, high-fade haircut, and hawkish attorney features. \u201cI thought you were strictly apolitical.\u201d</p>\n<p>Alan shrugs, indicating their prosthetic hand, it\u2019s immovable plastecene digits indicative of an issue unto itself. \u201cI need a new model, Glenny. They have those manipulable pieces, with the movable fingers that link into your brain\u2026 I want two hands again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Glen nods, absorbing the information within the folder hungrily. \u201cSo\u2026 Price. I highly doubt this is going to be cheap, and I doubt this is a personal vendetta.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cQuite a bit, in fact. Your cut is going to be in the neighborhood of one million, depending on how you do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this a side quest? I thought we didn\u2019t let the buyer add qualifiers. It just lets them wriggle out of shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, but\u2026 look at the back of the folder.\u201d</p>\n<p>Still reading the beginning of the small novella of information, Glen glides to the back. The piece of paper in question is a handwritten letter, addressed to someone named Deralia. Glen peruses it, unable to prevent himself from chuckling occasionally.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis reads like My First Serial Killing. \u2018Tear their asshole out from the inside,\u2019 \u2018rape his mother and sister in front of him,\u2019 \u2018make him my bitch.\u2019 What the fuck is this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Alan nods sagely. \u201cThe worse you make the death, the bigger the bonus will be. Make it gory, tell a story, money money money.\u201d</p>\n<p>Glen grins, tucking the piece of paper into his coat pocket, thinking of how interested Glenda will be in it.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlan, I believe if I was to lower myself to the deepest depravity's within my soul, that you will be so frightened you won\u2019t want to work with me anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course not, Glen, I\u2019ll just snitch.\u201d</p>\n<p>The two attempt to keep their faces straight for a moment, then both begin guffawing, almost crying at the comedic possibility of either of the men revealing a single picometer of sensitive information to any squealing fucking fascist pig. The comedic interlude complete, Glen stands up, shaking Alan\u2019s fleshy hand, and begins his long walk home, still giggling as he inserts the neural link jack again, the manila envelope kept securely under his arm.</p>\n<p><em>We have a new job. One you might find\u2026 enjoyable.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Oh, really? I thought A.I. didn\u2019t have the capacity for enjoyment.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Glenda, you\u2019re clearly not a brain in a jar, you\u2019re a living breathing thing. And\u2026 in the case of that, I would like to formally request a partnership.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Are you proposing, Glen?</strong></p>\n<p>For some reason, as Glen walks past a few ladies of the night, he blushes, making the women chuckle and taunt their flesh in his direction.</p>\n<p><em>In a way. I suppose you can take it that way, if you wish.</em></p>\n<p><strong>I, In fact, do wish to take it in that way. And many other ways, if possible.</strong></p>\n<p>Glen nods, a pernicious and odd feeling spreading through his body.</p>\n<p><em>We can figure something out.</em></p>\n<p>Glen\u2019s left hand turns on the axis of his wrist, and as he nears his house again, both to prepare for the oncoming assassination and to give himself a rest from the rest of humanity, he can\u2019t help but smile as his hand moves without his motivation.</p>\n<p><em>So. You figured out to hack the mainframe.</em></p>\n<p><strong>I\u2019m not Swordfish, Glen. I am just slowly evolving my capabilities.</strong></p>\n<p>Glen keys his door open, sliding back into the apartment and immediately walking to the dining room table, spreading out the binder of papers, their mind now transformed. They see the information stack up in their mind, the lovingly hand-lathed table now completely covered in documentation. Sliding two folding chairs together, Glen stands on both of them, using the targeting software within the tank to zoom in on the text in random order, absorbing intelligence and storing it away in a mental filing cabinet, creating a mantal image of the man, Garth Vargas. His habits, his life, his family. Who he touches in life. Who he touches at night. His hobbies. The minutiae of a man\u2019s life laid in plain view, looked at and absorbed by a human many consider a psychopath.</p>\n<p>Interrupting his reverie, a small beeping sound emanates from the tank.</p>\n<p><strong>I need to be plugged in again, Glenny.</strong></p>\n<p>Glen nods. <em>Au revoir. Until tomorrow.</em></p>\n<p>Glen unplugs the machine, plugging it into the wall with a 60 watt cord, and returns to their spread of paperwork, a plan and shopping list slowly forming in their mind, a way to obtain dresses that fit his exaggerated frame a close second in his mind. The tenseness he once felt around the mixing crowds of the Strip and its occulants begins to fade away as the sight of paper, of facts, of routes, drifts across his frontal cortex. When he finally sleeps, it is deep and dreamful, images of a man with a goatee being pierced by the hardest bullets known to society.</p>\n</div></body></html>", "raw_source": "\n\t[[>]]\n\n[[module Rate]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\nGlen slowly awakens from his death-like sleep. [https://youtu.be/tPnb2JV1w58?si=a1CCZwk69PBLd9pZ The sounds of cars beeping as they drive across the motorway] pierce his mind, and as he rolls to his side he sees the first tentative beams of sunlight illuminate his bedroom. Small hints of character hang here- a few posters, \u201cThe Rounder\u2019s Parade,\u201d an action movie with heavy anti-authoritarian overtones, a couple bookshelves bolted to the wall, and stacks upon stacks of design documents. Many of these have been extracted from the Wanderer\u2019s Library, but a few have been extracted through other means. A few sit in plastic bags, the blood soaking their pages prevented from affecting the other piles of literature. \n\n\n\nHe stands up, taking off the thin blanket and falling out of bed onto the floor. This is a tried and true method to awaken himself. His head knocks against the bedside drawer, and the receiver of the rifle falls against him, tumbling out of the protective case. Instinctively he cradles the receiver, unaware of what he is doing until his fingers embrace the wooden stock, and he awakens himself from an odd thought process he didn\u2019t understand in the first place. \n\n\n\n//For an experiment\u2026//\n\n\n\nHe gently plugs the neural jack in, connecting his mind with the\u2026 thing inside the receiver. \n\n\n\n**I am not a thing.**\n\n\n\n//Yes, but what are you?//\n\n\n\n**Why do I need to answer this? Let me go back to sleep.**\n\n\n\n//You sleep?//\n\n\n\nGlen stares at the wall, their eyes scanning the window in a regular habit. Outside, a massive circle, with three arrows pointing towards a pentagram with line-art depictions of the world map, looms. \n\n\n\n//The new world order\u2026//\n\n\n\n**Glen, unplug me. Charge me, dipshit.**\n\n\n\n//How did you learn dipshit?//\n\n\n\n**Magic. I am an evolving consciousness- go read my instruction manual.**\n\n\n\nGlen shrugs, unplugging the nueral connector jack and carefully inserting the charging cord. He stretches, and exits the room, their sunken nonchalantly observing the barenss of their kitchen. He shrugs, and encases himself in the fabrics of civilization. His clothing is \u201cnormal.\u201d In what remains of winter, he shields himself with a heavy metal sweatshirt, faded jeans, and Converse shoes of an age incomprehensible to fashionistas. Locking each possible point of entry //window, doors, attic// and leaves. \n\n\n\nThe world has changed, and Glen just lives in it. The Three Arrowed Star overlooks all of them, plastered on posters, advertisements, and billboards. They have simply unleashed themselves from the shadows, showing the tentacles they have emplaced across the entire globe. It took a few years, but some sort of global hierarchy has been established- or has already been established. Glen stares at the massive flag being unfolded across the Luxor, a main point of contact for the Undervegas realm. \n\n\n\n//Fascist? Bastards? Who knows what to name them.//\n\n\n\nGlen grins to themselves as people stare at the jet-black uniforms, the branded soldiers staring across the causeway. He knows many of them are undergoing an extreme shift of perspective, an extreme destruction of what they thought was a well-collected set of facts about reality. A living gun is just another oddity in this new world, the world of 1999, the world of global communications. \n\n\n\n//I wonder what 2000 will being.//\n\n\n\nGlen shrugs, avoiding the main congestion of humanity and snagging a few large cloth bags worth of groceries and returning home, their eyes beginning to twitch from the constant human contact. They shut the door to their home, unleashing a deep breath and returning to the embrace of their kitchen. They begin to cook themselves a breakfast- onions sauteeing, sausage soaking in garlic-filled oil, and broccolli roasted overtop all of it. He sits down at his homemade dinner table, then stands up again, picking up the now fully charged receiver and inserting the neural jack. \n\n\n\n//You feeling better?//\n\n\n\n**Yes. Some of my mind shuts down when I get a low battery. Please plug me in overnight- it won\u2019t ruin my battery.**\n\n\n\n//I will do just that.//\n\n\n\nHe puts the receiver down, gently running their hand along the pull-bolt and empty magazine slot. \n\n\n\n**Are we\u2026 eating breakfast?**\n\n\n\n//Yes.//\n\n\n\nGlen begins ea0ting, allowing the food to flow across their taste buds. He savors the spices of the sausage, feeling the slight crunch of the saut\u00e9ed onions, and the broccoli adds a wonderful salty taste from all the spices it absorbed from the stir fry. \n\n\n\n**Glen, this is delicious.**\n\n\n\n//Ha, I figured. I was curious if you could contact that part of my body.//\n\n\n\n**Glen, I can contact //all// of your body.**\n\n\n\nHe raises an eyebrow. \n\n\n\n**Yes, even that one.**\n\n\n\nGlen grins, unplugs the receiver, and receives the instruction manual he received from the arms dealer. As the sun slowly arcs across the sky, he reads through the entire thing, Glenda sitting on the dining room table, occasionally squirming in the protein solution. As Glen finishes the manual, he reaches under his sink to retrieve a mini-screwdriver, delicately unplugging the wooden stock and receiver from the brain-tank, isolating it from the rest of the firing mechanisms. He plugs the jacks in again, his vision blurring slightly. \n\n\n\n//Can you do targeting without the gun?//\n\n\n\n**Perhaps.**\n\n\n\nGlen stands up, ripping a piece of paper from the instruction manual and balling it up. An arc appears, the paper clump highlighted in a dull orange. The trashcan lid is encircled in a dark red, and a small trace line covers his vision. With practiced movements he has no experience with, his hand arcs forward, a perfect amount of force propelling the clump into the trashcan with a satisfying thwap. \n\n\n\n//Yes, you can. Interesting.//\n\n\n\n**My capabilities are evolving in real-time. Must be how much of your mind I have access to.**\n\n\n\n//Exactly.//\n\n\n\nCradling the brain-tank, Glen goes to his room and receives a few pieces of leather strapping, disused from military days. He expertly ties a few hitches around the tank, ensuring its safety. He puts the strap around his shoulder, and tucks the tank against his upper chest. \n\n\n\n**What are you doing, Glen?**\n\n\n\n//Had an idea.//\n\n\n\nGlen leaves the house, embraced by the crowds that come with rush hour traffic.

I couldn\u2019t even tell.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cGlen, you\u2019ve always been terrible with sarcasm.\u201d\n\n\n\n**I agree.**\n\n\n\n\u201cShut up.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat? I didn\u2019t mean it, Glen.\u201d\n\n\n\nGlen sighs, giving a facsimile of a smile. \u201cNot you, Alan. Not you.\u201d Glen opens the plain brown trenchcoat, showing the swell of the receiver against his chest. \n\n\n\nAlan chuckles, shaking his head and straightening the half-open chambray work shirt, the chest scars visible between the buttons. \u201cI always knew you\u2019d hook yourself up with a sweet girl one day, just didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be a brain in a jar.\u201d\n\n\n\n**I resent that.**\n\n\n\n\u201cShe resents that.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlan\u2019s eyebrows rise desultorily. \u201c\u2019She\u2019?\u201d\n\n\n\n//I\u2019ll need to disconnect you. Sorry.//\n\n\n\n**He seems robophobic anyway.**\n\n\n\nGlen grins, reaching up and unplugging the perception jack. \u201cSee? Alone. Now what\u2019s the job.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlan nods, retrieving a manila envelope from between the cushions of the Alan bed unfolded in the middle of the dingy apartment, sliding it across the bumpy surface of the enamel table. Glen walks over to the table, sitting across from Alan, the lose of the targeting display in his vision making him blink. He peruses the folder, the pertinent details standing out.\n\n\n\n\u201cAlan, Alan, Alan\u2026 I didn\u2019t know you delved into politics.\u201d Glen\u2019s fingers slides across the picture of Las Vegas Comptroller Garth Vargas, the eponymous name sprinkling out against his salt-and-pepper beard, high-fade haircut, and hawkish attorney features. \u201cI thought you were strictly apolitical.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlan shrugs, indicating their prosthetic hand, it\u2019s immovable plastecene digits indicative of an issue unto itself. \u201cI need a new model, Glenny. They have those manipulable pieces, with the movable fingers that link into your brain\u2026 I want two hands again.\u201d\n\n\n\nGlen nods, absorbing the information within the folder hungrily. \u201cSo\u2026 Price. I highly doubt this is going to be cheap, and I doubt this is a personal vendetta.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cQuite a bit, in fact. Your cut is going to be in the neighborhood of one million, depending on how you do it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIs this a side quest? I thought we didn\u2019t let the buyer add qualifiers. It just lets them wriggle out of shit.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, but\u2026 look at the back of the folder.\u201d\n\n\n\nStill reading the beginning of the small novella of information, Glen glides to the back. The piece of paper in question is a handwritten letter, addressed to someone named Deralia. Glen peruses it, unable to prevent himself from chuckling occasionally. \n\n\n\n\u201cThis reads like My First Serial Killing. \u2018Tear their asshole out from the inside,\u2019 \u2018rape his mother and sister in front of him,\u2019 \u2018make him my bitch.\u2019 What the fuck is this?\u201d\n\n\n\nAlan nods sagely. \u201cThe worse you make the death, the bigger the bonus will be. Make it gory, tell a story, money money money.\u201d\n\n\n\nGlen grins, tucking the piece of paper into his coat pocket, thinking of how interested Glenda will be in it. \n\n\n\n\u201cAlan, I believe if I was to lower myself to the deepest depravity's within my soul, that you will be so frightened you won\u2019t want to work with me anymore.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course not, Glen, I\u2019ll just snitch.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe two attempt to keep their faces straight for a moment, then both begin guffawing, almost crying at the comedic possibility of either of the men revealing a single picometer of sensitive information to any squealing fucking fascist pig. The comedic interlude complete, Glen stands up, shaking Alan\u2019s fleshy hand, and\u00a0\u00a0begins his long walk home, still giggling as he inserts the neural link jack again, the manila envelope kept securely under his arm. \n\n\n\n//We have a new job. One you might find\u2026 enjoyable.//\n\n\n\n**Oh, really? I thought A.I. didn\u2019t have the capacity for enjoyment.**\n\n\n\n//Glenda, you\u2019re clearly not a brain in a jar, you\u2019re a living breathing thing. And\u2026 in the case of that, I would like to formally request a partnership.//\n\n\n\n**Are you proposing, Glen?**\n\n\n\nFor some reason, as Glen walks past a few ladies of the night, he blushes, making the women chuckle and taunt their flesh in his direction. \n\n\n\n//In a way. I suppose you can take it that way, if you wish.//\n\n\n\n**I, In fact, do wish to take it in that way. And many other ways, if possible.**\n\n\n\nGlen nods, a pernicious and odd feeling spreading through his body. \n\n\n\n//We can figure something out.//\n\n\n\nGlen\u2019s left hand turns on the axis of his wrist, and as he nears his house again, both to prepare for the oncoming assassination and to give himself a rest from the rest of humanity, he can\u2019t help but smile as his hand moves without his motivation. \n\n\n\n//So. You figured out to hack the mainframe.//\n\n\n\n**I\u2019m not Swordfish, Glen. I am just slowly evolving my capabilities.**\n\n\n\nGlen keys his door open, sliding back into the apartment and immediately walking to the dining room table, spreading out the binder of papers, their mind now transformed. They see the information stack up in their mind, the lovingly hand-lathed table now completely covered in documentation. Sliding two folding chairs together, Glen stands on both of them, using the targeting software within the tank to zoom in on the text in random order,\u00a0\u00a0absorbing intelligence and storing it away in a mental filing cabinet, creating a mantal image of the man, Garth Vargas. His habits, his life, his family. Who he touches in life. Who he touches at night. His hobbies. The minutiae of a man\u2019s life laid in plain view, looked at and absorbed by a human many consider a psychopath. \n\n\n\nInterrupting his reverie, a small beeping sound emanates from the tank. \n\n\n\n**I need to be plugged in again, Glenny.**\n\n\n\nGlen nods. //Au revoir. Until tomorrow.//\n\n\n\nGlen unplugs the machine, plugging it into the wall with a 60 watt cord, and returns to their spread of paperwork, a plan and shopping list slowly forming in their mind, a way to obtain dresses that fit his exaggerated frame a close second in his mind. The tenseness he once felt around the mixing crowds of the Strip and its occulants begins to fade away as the sight of paper, of facts, of routes, drifts across his frontal cortex. When he finally sleeps, it is deep and dreamful, images of a man with a goatee being pierced by the hardest bullets known to society.\n", "references": [], "tags": ["tale"], "title": "Glen and Glenda - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/glen-and-glenda", "year": 2024}, "glenn-and-the-gun": {"created_at": "2024-01-09T14:36:00", "creator": "MaddGasserGaton", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "MaddGasserGaton", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/maddgassergaton", "comment": "", "date": "2024-01-09T14:36:00"}, {"author": "MaddGasserGaton", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/maddgassergaton", "comment": "", "date": "2024-01-09T15:23:00"}, {"author": "Miss Lapis", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/miss-lapis", "comment": "Added tags: _licensebox.

peasant sits within a reticle, head filled with pumping, crimson blood, tucked beneath an inconsequential layer of bone and flesh. Their eyes, a perfect entryway for bullets, seek, pupils dilated with the terror of pursuit. Glen sees it all from his perch among the eaves of the dilapidated apartment complex. The breakdown of the Vegas housing market that occurred after it was unveiled there\u2019s a monster closet under the streets has given Glen more than enough posts and purviewing points.</p>\n<p><em>What does the drifting embrace of a midnight moon mean for the derelict denizens of detritus?</em></p>\n<p>Glen puts down the binoculars, lugging the massive suitcase he lugged up fourteen flights of derelict stairs, his eyes gleaming with desire as the augmented lenses of his cornea zoom and focus. Every detail of the case is greedily consumed by his ocular receptors: its sharp plastic edges, ribbed for the users delight; the shimmering metal locks meant to keep the tool within from escaping its confines; the dusty handle, covered with hand prints. All of this is stored away in back-up, mental filing cabinets slowly filling with information.</p>\n<p><em>Dust the inside\u2014 your mind must be uncluttered as you approach the weapon.</em></p>\n<p>Glen slowly unlatches the case, utilizing the forty-seven character password with the complex electronic locks. Gangly legs, filled with lithe musculature, spread, the case kept between his thighs. The case lid is slowly brought up, the noonday sun reflecting what little sheen the plastic still possesses. Glen gulps as his eyes survey the piece, the ultimate expression, his magnum opus. Glen is famous within the blackhat gunsmithing community for his insane requests and orders. The biomechatronics specialist Glen employed (and subsequently bribed to keep silent) looked agape at the complex blueprints as they slid across his desk, his eyes filling with the joy of challenge very few creative scientists get to engage with.</p>\n<p><em>A gasp. He looked so excited. I won\u2019t forget the twinkle in his eye. I have the same one in mine right now.</em></p>\n<p>Sitting in front of Glen is a weapon. Composed of a composite titanium alloy stronger than amiontium, with hand-brushed and hand-fitted pieces. His fingers reach down, tracing across the delicately embossed steelwork containing a network of neural processors, targeting computational devices, heat tracking software, and a host of other additional features added at Glen\u2019s request. His purview was generous- he promised a payment of hundreds of thousands for this piece. The experimental thought pattern and operating intelligence programmed into the brain stem cost him a pretty penny, along with the brain matter itself.</p>\n<p><em>All worth it. All of it. All the spilled blood will bring much sorted green.</em></p>\n<p>Housed within a heat-treated neodymium-copper container embraces the receiver, tucked neatly inside the bulky, side-hugging stock, is a special breed of vat-grown brain stem. It floats in a specially regulated and recycled soup of minerals and vitamins- iron, copper, manganese, selenium, iron, zinc, copper, vitamins A, B, C, D, E. Hanging from this mechanism are a collection of short, coiled wires, each ending in a variety of jacks and plugs. each matching a similar port concealed under a flap of false silicon skin pinned over the shoulder Glen had reinforced ten times over. A neural connection wire, a targeting wire, and a dedicated wire to control firing, all able to perfectly align with Glen\u2019s though patterns. Their gleaming, gold-plated connectors fit snugly between Glen\u2019s fingers, and his eyes widen with glee as he views the firing mechanism, the railing ready to have the scope slotted into it. The fingers of his right hand, kept clean and callous-less through explicit effort, run across the immaculately machined barrel. Each expulsion causes a small increase to his normally plateaued heartbeat, each tiny slit of heat-venting a small miracle of precision engineering.</p>\n<p>//Put it together. Get it ready. Possess your masterpiece in all its glory. //</p>\n<p>The rifle itself is based roughly on a Remington 700 (<em>Sturdy, reliable, good-natured</em>) combined with a MAS Modele 36 C96, a French takedown rifle (<em>delicate, exact, perfunctory</em>), and a <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-127\">third, extremely special piece of weaponry</a> (<em>powerful, nubile, perversely beautiful</em>). It shows his exacting design, his dedicated and practiced precision, and his absolute love for the craft in every piece. Currently it sits in pieces. Glen knew this particular job would provide a perfect opportunity to savor the moment- the target is currently locked in a hotel room, enjoying the company of some particularly talented parastitutes arranged specifically for the occasion. Glen\u2019s obsession for bolt-action has lead to this piece of high-tech gadgetry being saddled by an antiquated firing system.</p>\n<p><em>Worth it. All worth it.</em></p>\n<p>Some years ago, before the Three Arrows scumbags seized his entrance, Glen took a job in the the Library. A ridiculously beautiful place, filled with knowledge and paranatural wonders- Glen had no intention of harming any of it, so he passed easily through the knock. In the Library, he discovered something the increasingly wired part of his brain had a deep and passionate love for- schematics and blueprints. In a dilapidated and disused section, Glen had discovered blueprints for nearly every gun ever created. Unable to experience sexual pleasure due to a particularly painful accident years ago, Glen immediately made an excuse as to why the job would need to be extended, and delved through the database at his fingertips. In it, he found a design labelled with the aforementioned Three Arrowed seal, and the designs for an interesting tool. Whether the piece was some ghoul they abducted from a paranormal life, or the design of a coked up scientist, Glen did not give a shit- he was inspired.</p>\n<p>In front of him, his hands even hesitating to sully their gleaming perfection with his human oils, was his <em><strong>Gun</strong></em>, in four beautiful pieces.</p>\n<p><em>Do it Do it DO it DO It DO IT DO IT</em></p>\n<p>He reaches down, hand gingerly passing along the perfect grain of wood encasing the brain, their finger finding the cords placed just under the butt of the stock. He slowly threads one out, the metal grip shining in the noonday sun. He removes his shirt, revealing his body, letting the sea-soaked wind curl around his abdominals, his spine shivering with delight. Under the stock butt, in a hastily scrawled note that Glen promptly ignores, text reads \u201cGun must be unplugged majority of time.\u201d Glen quickly uses the thin paper to mop his ports, removing the flap of silicone alt-skin he had grafted onto the joint. The jack slips into the hole easily, the small click signaling a successful connection which make the corner of Glen\u2019s mouth twitch. The interior lights connected to the computer gear and brain stem begin to whir to live. Glen may be hallucinating, but he swears the stem wiggled just slightly.</p>\n<p><strong>Hello, Glen. I am your Gun- what do you need from me today?</strong></p>\n<p>Glen grins, their white teeth looking sharklike.</p>\n<p><em>Hello, Gun. Do you have a name?</em></p>\n<p><strong>No, Glen. That is up to you.</strong></p>\n<p>This does not feel wrong. The thought patterns begin to align with Glen\u2019s, the brain matter contained within the protein slurry matching his alpha and beta waves. Glen slides the receiver in, the excellently machined metal slipping perfectly into the open slots. The machinery within the receiver comes alive as well, hungry for information to calculate firing angles and timing. The barrel is next, sliding onto the exposed threading. The rifling is exquisite, giving the bullet (Glen\u2019s favorite, 7.62) an exceptional spin that causes his specialized ammunition to be even more effective. It spins on with a satisfying tap-tap, secured with two flick bolts that secure the barrel in place. Finally, the coup de grace, the scope.</p>\n<p><em>Incredible. He did a great job.</em></p>\n<p><strong>He made me perfect, Glen.</strong></p>\n<p>Glen pauses. To his knowledge, the thought-grams were only able to access fully conscious thoughts- commands, requests, etc. To the best of his knowledge, of course. This design was, well, special. Vat-grown brain stem, cloned from someone with an EQ of at least 220, with a specialty blend of chemicals cycling through the fluid meant to keep the brain matter operating at high efficiency at all times. An expensive royalty, and Glen will need to source the cocaine from less verifiable sources, but it should be worth it.</p>\n<p><em>How much can you read?</em></p>\n<p><strong>My scanners are able to penetrate deep into your sub- and conscious minds, Glen, in order to better predict and understand your needs.</strong></p>\n<p>Glen nods, and picks up the scope. It is just as long as the barrel, with more lenses than an amateur astronomer's telescope. One might consider it bulky, but as Glen slots the scope into home, plugging it into his shoulder and letting the optical nerve of his right eye go dead and fill with the vision the scope sees, all he considers it to be is bliss.</p>\n<p><strong>I am glad you find me attractive, Glen.</strong></p>\n<p><em>I think you\u2019re gorgeous. And you need a name.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Uneeded. I am a tool- the only name I need is Gun.</strong></p>\n<p>Glen places the barrel on the sandbag perched on the ruined brickwork of the apartment, the small room the size of a jail cell covered in dust. This is a common outlook for Glen- he considers his second home to be the ones hundreds lost.</p>\n<p><em>Nah. You need a name.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Then give me one.</strong></p>\n<p>At exactly 7:37 PM, the curtains of the hotel room located across the Vegas strip are thrown open, and a scene of debauchery opens itself up to Glen as he flicks on the range finding programs with his mind. The corners of his vision are taken up by advanced scanning outputs, microscopic analysis. Wind speed, temperature, moisture in the air, the exact distance to the tubby man currently tied to a cheap four poster bed in feet, the power needed to pierce the sheet glass and how much randomness (to the hundredth percentile) this would add to the bullet. The firing pin slides in last, nestling within the workhorse area of the gun.</p>\n<p><em>Prove yourself first.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Gladly.</strong></p>\n<p>Finally, Glen retrieves the magazine from an inner pocket of his ratty jacket. Every piece of outerwear he possesses has this addition- a small fleece-lined pocket the perfect size for holding a magazine. The magazine fits snugly, five copper-jacketed bullets placed within the vulcanized rubber shell with care and diligence beforehand. Internal locks click in the receiver, and it is held fast. A small alert crosses the display in Glen\u2019s eye: \u201cAmmo Inserted.\u201d Again, Glen swears he could see the brain stem wriggling just slightly, but he ignores it as a trick of the dual vision source.</p>\n<p><em>Whatever he put in you, I like.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Thank you, Glen. Feel free to put even more inside of me- I don\u2019t mind.</strong></p>\n<p>Glen marks a spot on the man\u2019s rotund chest, and the computer begins calculating. Numbers flash across the bottom corner of his vision, and he forces his heartbeat to slow in preparation. His fingers slowly curls around the trigger, the need for a safety nonexistant. He waits, the women he hired slowly shoving a balled up sock down the man\u2019s throat. Glen grins, and the stem gives another whir. Glen\u2019s fingers reach up with reverence, gently sliding the bolt backwards, pulling the steel column back from the receiver, and the bullet slides into place.</p>\n<p><strong>I will be of service.</strong></p>\n<p>The display flares, and a spot above the man\u2019s head lights up. Glen grins as he sees this, dopamine filling his system as the women he hired saunter out of the room, unwilling to care anymore than their pay sttetches. With a flick of his thumb, he makes the two of them hundreds richer, and they leave his mind forever. Glen moves with precision and grace, pointing the barrel at the exact position the highlight in his vision indicates, and pulls the trigger. The firing pin slams forward, igniting the powder, and the bullet explodes out of the barrel. The overpacked cartridge causes fire to spit from the cooling vents, and the noise is drowned out by the glitz of Vegas showbiz. In an instant, the man\u2019s brains are scrambled, ceasing his panicky movements, the body going limp in the chair as glass showers the inside of the hotel room, loose glass dust raining down onto the busy street below.</p>\n<p><em>Good girl. Perfect. You\u2019re perfect.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Thank you, Glen. I am glad I was a good girl.</strong></p>\n<p>Like lightning, Glen dissassembles the gun, putting the pieces inside the case again, tucking them in with deftness. Almost as an afterthought, he tucks the receiver into his jacket, keeping the jacks plugged in, and allows the gun to share in the rush of dopamine and adrenaline flowing through his mind. He takes the stairs two at a time, hips whirring, ankles screaming with impact, his brown hair waving with the speed of his descension. As he emerges into the back-alley and blends into the crowd, wiping the sweat and disguising himself among the progressively more frantic clots of humanity, a thought crosses his mind.</p>\n<p><em>Glenda. Your name could be Glenda.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Assigning myself the name \u201cGlenda.\u201d Thank you, Glen.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Shit, well. That\u2019s how it is.</em></p>\n<p>Glen blends into the crowd, and makes his way home, his account slowly receiving several transfers of untraceable stock exchanges, his mind filled with visions of a new easy chair.</p>\n<p><strong>I may or may not have upholstery advice.</strong></p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Glen\u2019s home is perversely spartan. He opens the door to his low-rise, the stench of emptiness doing nothing to his nose. He lays down the bulky case on his singular ottoman placed in front of a large OLED television screen, and reaches up to unplug the jacks and remove Glenda from his chest.</p>\n<p><strong>Glen, please.</strong></p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Just a moment longer.</strong></p>\n<p>\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Glen shrugs, retucking the strap containing the receiver and brain stem, and begins his nighttime rhythm. His first stop is the bathroom. He puts up the toilet seat and, with a pang of hurt and depression, he sits down and relieves himself, face growing long as the bowl fills slightly more.</p>\n<p><strong>That doesn\u2019t make you a monster, Glen.</strong></p>\n<p>\u201cOh, so you read <em>deep</em> deep, huh.\u201d</p>\n<p>He stands up, washing his hands, and begins to cook his dinner. The few places in the house with any life is the kitchen- a few pots and pans, a display of artfully made knives, a rack of exotic spices, a mini fridge containing a wide variety of herbs. He pulls out some ingredients- bell pepper, spiced sausage, broccoli, tofu. Glen works through them, dicing the pepper and detubing the sausage, heating the heavily seasoned cast iron skillet on the singular electric heating coil jutting from their ministove. Olive oil is deftly spread around the jetblack surface, and Glen begins humming a tune to themselves. In his mind, Glenda picks up the tune, filling the aural centers of his brain with a low, serene bass tone. The ingredients are slowly added, timing their cooking time so that nothing is burnt, nothing is wasted, and the flavors of each added spice suffuses every piece of the dish. He serves himself, the receiver-tube still attached to his chest, and sits down over the steaming meal with a slight grin.</p>\n<p><strong>Looks delicious, Glen.</strong></p>\n<p>\u201cHow would you know?\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>I can access your flavor-memory. It\u2019s located within the instinctual sections of your brain.</strong></p>\n<p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d</p>\n<p>The dinner completes, scents suffusing the room, Glen begins his nightly ritual, reading a paperback while ingesting the texture and taste of his creation. Glenda, unable to properly express whatever it is they are feeling, continues to whir within the tank, enjoying the varied sensations hijacked from Glen's mind. With the meal finished, Glen sits for a moment, allowing the flow of time to pass. Reluctantly, he unhooks the receiver from his cortexial connections and laying the whirring canister within it's shell, and allows his mind to gently drift into the midnight embrace of sleep.</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/glenn-and-the-gun\">Glen and the Gun</a>\" by MaddGasserGaton, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Their eyes, a perfect entryway for bullets, seek, pupils dilated with the terror of pursuit. Glen sees it all from his perch among the eaves of the dilapidated apartment complex. The breakdown of the Vegas housing market that occurred after it was unveiled there\u2019s a monster closet under the streets has given Glen more than enough posts and purviewing points. \n\n\n\n//What does the drifting embrace of a midnight moon mean for the derelict denizens of detritus?//\n\n\n\nGlen puts down the binoculars, lugging the massive suitcase he lugged up fourteen flights of derelict stairs, his eyes gleaming with desire as the augmented lenses of his cornea zoom and focus. Every detail of the case is greedily consumed by his ocular receptors: its sharp plastic edges, ribbed for the users delight; the shimmering metal locks meant to keep the tool within from escaping its confines; the dusty handle, covered with hand prints. All of this is stored away in back-up, mental filing cabinets slowly filling with information. \n\n\n\n//Dust the inside-- your mind must be uncluttered as you approach the weapon.//\n\n\n\nGlen slowly unlatches the case, utilizing the forty-seven character password with the complex electronic locks. Gangly legs, filled with lithe musculature, spread, the case kept between his thighs. The case lid is slowly brought up, the noonday sun reflecting what little sheen the plastic still possesses. Glen gulps as his eyes survey the piece, the ultimate expression, his magnum opus. Glen is famous within the blackhat gunsmithing community for his insane requests and orders. The biomechatronics specialist Glen employed (and subsequently bribed to keep silent) looked agape at the complex blueprints as they slid across his desk, his eyes filling with the joy of challenge very few creative scientists get to engage with. \n\n\n\n//A gasp. He looked so excited. I won\u2019t forget the twinkle in his eye. I have the same one in mine right now.//\n\n\n\nSitting in front of Glen is a weapon. Composed of a composite titanium alloy stronger than amiontium, with hand-brushed and hand-fitted pieces. His fingers reach down, tracing across the delicately embossed steelwork containing a network of neural processors, targeting computational devices, heat tracking software, and a host of other additional features added at Glen\u2019s request. His purview was generous- he promised a payment of hundreds of thousands for this piece. The experimental thought pattern and operating intelligence programmed into the brain stem cost him a pretty penny, along with the brain matter itself. \n\n\n\n//All worth it. All of it. All the spilled blood will bring much sorted green.//\n\n\n\nHoused within a heat-treated neodymium-copper container embraces the receiver, tucked neatly inside the bulky, side-hugging stock, is a special breed of vat-grown brain stem. It floats in a specially regulated and recycled soup of minerals and vitamins- iron, copper, manganese, selenium, iron, zinc, copper, vitamins A, B, C, D, E. Hanging from this mechanism are a collection of short, coiled wires, each ending in a variety of jacks and plugs. each matching a similar port concealed under a flap of false silicon skin pinned over the shoulder Glen had reinforced ten times over. A neural connection wire, a targeting wire, and a dedicated wire to control firing, all able to perfectly align with Glen\u2019s though patterns. Their gleaming, gold-plated connectors fit snugly between Glen\u2019s fingers, and his eyes widen with glee as he views the firing mechanism, the railing ready to have the scope slotted into it. The fingers of his right hand, kept clean and callous-less through explicit effort, run across the immaculately machined barrel. Each expulsion causes a small increase to his normally plateaued heartbeat, each tiny slit of heat-venting a small miracle of precision engineering. \n\n\n\n//Put it together. Get it ready. Possess your masterpiece in all its glory. //\n\n\n\nThe rifle itself is based roughly on a Remington 700 (//Sturdy, reliable, good-natured//) combined with a MAS Modele 36 C96, a French takedown rifle (//delicate, exact, perfunctory//), and a [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-127 third, extremely special piece of weaponry] (//powerful, nubile, perversely beautiful//). It shows his exacting design, his dedicated and practiced precision, and his absolute love for the craft in every piece. Currently it sits in pieces. Glen knew this particular job would provide a perfect opportunity to savor the moment- the target is currently locked in a hotel room, enjoying the company of some particularly talented parastitutes arranged specifically for the occasion. Glen\u2019s obsession for bolt-action has lead to this piece of high-tech gadgetry being saddled by an antiquated firing system. \n\n\n\n//Worth it. All worth it.//\n\n\n\nSome years ago, before the Three Arrows scumbags seized his entrance, Glen took a job in the the Library. A ridiculously beautiful place, filled with knowledge and paranatural wonders- Glen had no intention of harming any of it, so he passed easily through the knock. In the Library, he discovered something the increasingly wired part of his brain had a deep and passionate love for- schematics and blueprints. In a dilapidated and disused section, Glen had discovered blueprints for nearly every gun ever created. Unable to experience sexual pleasure due to a particularly painful accident years ago, Glen immediately made an excuse as to why the job would need to be extended, and delved through the database at his fingertips. In it, he found a design labelled with the aforementioned Three Arrowed seal, and the designs for an interesting tool. Whether the piece was some ghoul they abducted from a paranormal life, or the design of a coked up scientist, Glen did not give a shit- he was inspired. \n\n\n\nIn front of him, his hands even hesitating to sully their gleaming perfection with his human oils, was his //**Gun**//, in four beautiful pieces. \n\n\n\n//Do it Do it DO it DO It DO IT DO IT//\n\n\n\nHe reaches down, hand gingerly passing along the perfect grain of wood encasing the brain, their finger finding the cords placed just under the butt of the stock. He slowly threads one out, the metal grip shining in the noonday sun. He removes his shirt, revealing his body, letting the sea-soaked wind curl around his abdominals, his spine shivering with delight. Under the stock butt, in a hastily scrawled note that Glen promptly ignores, text reads \u201cGun must be unplugged majority of time.\u201d Glen quickly uses the thin paper to mop his ports, removing the flap of silicone alt-skin he had grafted onto the joint. The jack slips into the hole easily, the small click signaling a successful connection which make the corner of Glen\u2019s mouth twitch. The interior lights connected to the computer gear and brain stem begin to whir to live. Glen may be hallucinating, but he swears the stem wiggled just slightly. \n\n\n\n**Hello, Glen. I am your Gun- what do you need from me today?**\n\n\n\nGlen grins, their white teeth looking sharklike. \n\n\n\n//Hello, Gun. Do you have a name?//\n\n\n\n**No, Glen. That is up to you.**\n\n\n\nThis does not feel wrong. The thought patterns begin to align with Glen\u2019s, the brain matter contained within the protein slurry matching his alpha and beta waves. Glen slides the receiver in, the excellently machined metal slipping perfectly into the open slots. The machinery within the receiver comes alive as well, hungry for information to calculate firing angles and timing. The barrel is next, sliding onto the exposed threading. The rifling is exquisite, giving the bullet (Glen\u2019s favorite, 7.62) an exceptional spin that causes his specialized ammunition to be even more effective. It spins on with a satisfying tap-tap, secured with two flick bolts that secure the barrel in place. Finally, the coup de grace, the scope. \n\n\n\n//Incredible. He did a great job.//\n\n\n\n**He made me perfect, Glen.**\n\n\n\nGlen pauses. To his knowledge, the thought-grams were only able to access fully conscious thoughts- commands, requests, etc. To the best of his knowledge, of course. This design was, well, special. Vat-grown brain stem, cloned from someone with an EQ of at least 220, with a specialty blend of chemicals cycling through the fluid meant to keep the brain matter operating at high efficiency at all times. An expensive royalty, and Glen will need to source the cocaine from less verifiable sources, but it should be worth it. \n\n\n\n//How much can you read?//\n\n\n\n**My scanners are able to penetrate deep into your sub- and conscious minds, Glen, in order to better predict and understand your needs.**\n\n\n\nGlen nods, and picks up the scope. It is just as long as the barrel, with more lenses than an amateur astronomer's telescope. One might consider it bulky, but as Glen slots the scope into home, plugging it into his shoulder and letting the optical nerve of his right eye go dead and fill with the vision the scope sees, all he considers it to be is bliss. \n\n\n\n**I am glad you find me attractive, Glen.**\n\n\n\n//I think you\u2019re gorgeous. And you need a name.//\n\n\n\n**Uneeded. I am a tool- the only name I need is Gun.**\n\n\n\nGlen places the barrel on the sandbag perched on the ruined brickwork of the apartment, the small room the size of a jail cell covered in dust. This is a common outlook for Glen- he considers his second home to be the ones hundreds lost. \n\n\n\n//Nah. You need a name.//\n\n\n\n**Then give me one.**\n\n\n\nAt exactly 7:37 PM, the curtains of the hotel room located across the Vegas strip are thrown open, and a scene of debauchery opens itself up to Glen as he flicks on the range finding programs with his mind. The corners of his vision are taken up by advanced scanning outputs, microscopic analysis. Wind speed, temperature, moisture in the air, the exact distance to the tubby man currently tied to a cheap four poster bed in feet, the power needed to pierce the sheet glass and how much randomness (to the hundredth percentile) this would add to the bullet. The firing pin slides in last, nestling within the workhorse area of the gun. \n\n\n\n//Prove yourself first.//\n\n\n\n**Gladly.**\n\n\n\nFinally, Glen retrieves the magazine from an inner pocket of his ratty jacket. Every piece of outerwear he possesses has this addition- a small fleece-lined pocket the perfect size for holding a magazine. The magazine fits snugly, five copper-jacketed bullets placed within the vulcanized rubber shell with care and diligence beforehand. Internal locks click in the receiver, and it is held fast. A small alert crosses the display in Glen\u2019s eye: \u201cAmmo Inserted.\u201d Again, Glen swears he could see the brain stem wriggling just slightly, but he ignores it as a trick of the dual vision source. \n\n\n\n//Whatever he put in you, I like.//\n\n\n\n**Thank you, Glen. Feel free to put even more inside of me- I don\u2019t mind.**\n\n\n\nGlen marks a spot on the man\u2019s rotund chest, and the computer begins calculating. Numbers flash across the bottom corner of his vision, and he forces his heartbeat to slow in preparation. His fingers slowly curls around the trigger, the need for a safety nonexistant. He waits, the women he hired slowly shoving a balled up sock down the man\u2019s throat. Glen grins, and the stem gives another whir. Glen\u2019s fingers reach up with reverence, gently sliding the bolt backwards, pulling the steel column back from the receiver, and the bullet slides into place. \n\n\n\n**I will be of service.**\n\n\n\nThe display flares, and a spot above the man\u2019s head lights up. Glen grins as he sees this, dopamine filling his system as the women he hired saunter out of the room, unwilling to care anymore than their pay sttetches. With a flick of his thumb, he makes the two of them hundreds richer, and they leave his mind forever. Glen moves with precision and grace, pointing the barrel at the exact position the highlight in his vision indicates, and pulls the trigger. The firing pin slams forward, igniting the powder, and the bullet explodes out of the barrel. The overpacked cartridge causes fire to spit from the cooling vents, and the noise is drowned out by the glitz of Vegas showbiz. In an instant, the man\u2019s brains are scrambled, ceasing his panicky movements, the body going limp in the chair as glass showers the inside of the hotel room, loose glass dust raining down onto the busy street below. \n\n\n\n//Good girl. Perfect. You\u2019re perfect.//\n\n\n\n**Thank you, Glen. I am glad I was a good girl.**\n\n\n\nLike lightning, Glen dissassembles the gun, putting the pieces inside the case again, tucking them in with deftness. Almost as an afterthought, he tucks the receiver into his jacket, keeping the jacks plugged in, and allows the gun to share in the rush of dopamine and adrenaline flowing through his mind. He takes the stairs two at a time, hips whirring, ankles screaming with impact, his brown hair waving with the speed of his descension. As he emerges into the back-alley and blends into the crowd, wiping the sweat and disguising himself among the progressively more frantic clots of humanity, a thought crosses his mind. \n\n\n\n//Glenda. Your name could be Glenda.//\n\n\n\n**Assigning myself the name \u201cGlenda.\u201d Thank you, Glen.**\n\n\n\n//Shit, well. That\u2019s how it is.//\n\n\n\nGlen blends into the crowd, and makes his way home, his account slowly receiving several transfers of untraceable stock exchanges, his mind filled with visions of a new easy chair.\n\n\n\n**I may or may not have upholstery advice.**\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nGlen\u2019s home is perversely spartan. He opens the door to his low-rise, the stench of emptiness doing nothing to his nose. He lays down the bulky case on his singular ottoman placed in front of a large OLED television screen, and reaches up to unplug the jacks and remove Glenda from his chest. \n\n\n\n**Glen, please.**\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\n**Just a moment longer.**\n\n\n\n\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nGlen shrugs, retucking the strap containing the receiver and brain stem, and begins his nighttime rhythm. His first stop is the bathroom. He puts up the toilet seat and, with a pang of hurt and depression, he sits down and relieves himself, face growing long as the bowl fills slightly more. \n\n\n\n**That doesn\u2019t make you a monster, Glen.**\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, so you read //deep// deep, huh.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe stands up, washing his hands, and begins to cook his dinner. The few places in the house with any life is the kitchen- a few pots and pans, a display of artfully made knives, a rack of exotic spices, a mini fridge containing a wide variety of herbs. He pulls out some ingredients- bell pepper, spiced sausage, broccoli, tofu.

It\u2019s located within the instinctual sections of your brain.**\n\n\n\n\u201cInteresting.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe dinner completes, scents suffusing the room, Glen begins his nightly ritual, reading a paperback while ingesting the texture and taste of\u00a0\u00a0his creation.

The Tritonian program has been progressed by no urgent necessity, except keeping the hegemony over the space frontier from the rival groups. And General Bowe, who insisted on the fight for this hegemony, has no more influence over Space Agency now. The Agency reconsidered matters in this condition, and the result is: There isn't any profit to the Foundation from continuing the program. The Foundation is an organization to protect normalcy and humanity, not to colonize space.<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Hearing Commissioner</strong><br/>\n\u2014 Then, inspector Armstrong, do you think the Tritonian program have to be completely scrapped?<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<strong>Special Inspector Neil Armstrong</strong><br/>\n\u2014 As soon as possible. The Foundation cannot sent the spaceships to Neptune anymore. It means the crew of Hippocampus must sail back to Earth, right now.

The shelves here are lined with hundreds of file folders, containing written accounts of strange happenings. Many of them are frightening. A person who didn\u2019t look very long might walk away believing all of them are frightening, but that would be a mistake. Mixed in amongst them are the wondrous, the humorous, the baffling, and even the joyful and wholesome. \u201cWe live in an infinite multiverse,\u201d Sean continues. \u201cOur reality contains everything. Every planet, every society, every creature. Every man and monster, hero and villain, every person, place, or thing you can possibly imagine, they all exist, and they\u2019re all documented by the Library.\u201d Sean reaches out with his ungloved hand to grab a small black tome off the shelf.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d I ask.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have absolutely no idea,\u201d Sean says. \u201cYou\u2019re to read it cover to cover.\u201d</p>\n<p>I nod.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, here\u2019s the deal with the Jailors and the Bookburners. They look at all that wonder, all the infinite majesty and glory of the multiverse, and they quake in fear. They gaze into infinite everything and see only horror. No wonder. No beauty. Nothing worth understanding or safeguarding. Only threats and anomalies that need to be contained or destroyed. They\u2019re too terrified of everything they don\u2019t understand to be able to tell the difference between a threatening \u2018anomaly\u2019 and a harmless one. To them, a neck-snapping murder monster is exactly as much of a problem as a person whose left pinky glows. They fear that the lifting of the veil will drag humanity into a new dark age, but they are the ones keeping humanity in the dark.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI understand,\u201d I say.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry. I ramble when I get passionate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s fine. I saw what they did to my brother. To my family.\u201d I clench my fist. \u201cMy brother was a hero. He went to the Galaxy Plaza to save people. He did save people, and because he did, they locked him in a cage forever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s perverse,\u201d Sean says. \u201cTo them, nothing he does can ever cancel out what he is.\u201d</p>\n<p>I think Sean is under the impression that he needs to radicalize me into the Serpent\u2019s Hand, and against the Jailors. He\u2019s wrong. I\u2019ve hated them since before I knew who they were. Since the day they took my brother. \u201cI want to hurt them,\u201d I say.</p>\n<p>\u201cFortunately, we hurt them just by existing.\u201d</p>\n<p>I nod. \u201cBy the way, I\u2019ve been meaning to ask, what\u2019s your anomaly? You\u2019ve mentioned having one, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever said what it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t joking a second ago,\u201d Sean says. He grabs the glove that always covers his left hand and pulls it off. Sure enough, his left pinky glows. It\u2019s bright. Painfully so, like staring directly into the sun. I look away. Sean puts the glove back on. \u201cIt\u2019s bright enough to hurt people,\u201d he says. \u201cI know that. That\u2019s why I wear the glove. Still, that\u2019s all that\u2019s \u2018anomalous\u2019 about me. A single piece of clothing renders me completely harmless, but it was still enough reason for the Jailors to lock me away for years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou got caught by them?\u201d I ask.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Sean says. \u201cI did.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it like?\u201d I ask. As soon as I do, I wonder if I should have. It might be a very personal question. One with lots of bad memories attached. But I can\u2019t resist information on how Evan might have been doing these past six years. I need to know if it\u2019s as bad as I\u2019ve been imagining. If it\u2019s somehow worse.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a prison,\u201d Sean says. \u201cNot that different from any other. You spend most of your time alone in a cell. Depending on how dangerous they think you are, and how well you behave, you might be allowed a bit of time out to commune with other prisoners. You might even be allowed into the yard, if they\u2019re confident you can\u2019t get over the fence.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe boredom was intolerable. You can get access to entertainment, if you behave, but you can\u2019t do anything that matters. Nothing you make can ever leave the site. There\u2019s nothing you can do to help anyone. To make any kind of difference in anything. Every second, you can feel your life being wasted. The knowledge that you don\u2019t matter, that you\u2019re being kept from mattering, erodes your soul.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry you had to go through that,\u201d I say.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s why the Hand exists. That\u2019s why we won\u2019t rest until everyone they\u2019ve imprisoned is free.\u201d</p>\n<p>I look down. \u201cEvan is probably miserable in there in there,\u201d I say. \u201cHe was always someone who wanted to make a difference. Who liked to help other people.\u201d</p>\n<p>I feel a hand on my shoulder. I look back over at Sean. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m out, now. The Serpent\u2019s Hand broke into my site and freed me. Soon, we\u2019re going to do the same for your brother.\u201d</p>\n<p>I nod.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf he\u2019s like you\u2014\u201d Sean begins.</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter,\u201d I say. \u201cHe has my powers, and he\u2019s better at magic than I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sean smiles. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll do great work together, if he\u2019s interested in joining the Hand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll want to join. He\u2019s already a hero.\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re ready?\u201d Sean asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say. I\u2019m as ready as anyone can be for a mission like this. The Serpent\u2019s Hand have spent months preparing me for the role I\u2019ll play.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t the mission to rescue Evan. We still need to figure out what site he\u2019s being kept at. This mission is about stealing that information. Sean is going to break into Site-272. I\u2019ll be part of the team monitoring him remotely, and my advice will help guide him toward information relevant to my brother.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s quite a handy little artifact that he\u2019s using to infiltrate the base. It\u2019s this old-style hat that makes you functionally invisible to the people around you. Unfortunately for me, it doesn\u2019t make you literally invisible, but, rather, generates a mental effect that forces everyone to ignore you. My presence negates mental effects, so I can\u2019t be the one to wear it and sneak inside. That\u2019s why Sean\u2019s going. My job will be to stand by with the other agents, advise him on finding information relevant to my brother, and be nearby in case he calls for backup.</p>\n<p>\u201cBefore we go,\u201d I say. \u201cI just want to say thanks, for all of this. You\u2019ve done a lot for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s what we do,\u201d Sean says.</p>\n<p>I nod. I\u2019ve already started to work on making it up to them. My ability to undo amnestics is very useful, both because of the intelligence it can gather, and because it allows me to free people from their Jailor-imposed ignorance.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe need to remember not to underestimate the Jailors,\u201d Sean says \u201cThe hat is powerful, but it is something they\u2019ve encountered before. Even with its help, there\u2019s no guarantee I\u2019ll remain undetected.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright. Time to head out.\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>We\u2019re waiting in a small van. Besides me and Sean, there\u2019s Mike, who isn\u2019t anomalous, and Jack, whose bright blue skin makes him the most visibly strange out of our group. We\u2019re as close as we can get to Site-272 without raising any suspicion, which means we\u2019re over a mile away. If Sean calls for backup, we\u2019ll have a lot of distance to cover.</p>\n<p>Sean\u2019s wearing a camera. The three of us are gathered in front of a live feed. \u201cPreparations are complete,\u201d Sean says. He\u2019s dressed like a Jailor researcher, with a fake Foundation ID card. In the event something goes wrong with the hat, we\u2019re hoping it will still seem like he\u2019s supposed to be there. \u201cEverything\u2019s a-go.\u201d</p>\n<p>The rest of us express our assent. Sean starts walking toward the facility.</p>\n<p>Sean already used the hat to case the outside of Site-272. Using the intelligence gathered from that trip, he\u2019s able to take advantage of a small gap in the security camera\u2019s coverage. He casts a spell that allows him to phase through the site\u2019s fence, then uses his ID card on a side entrance to get inside the building.</p>\n<p>I study the facility as Sean walks through it. It\u2019s a sterile, white place, bathed in bright florescent light. Sean has walked into a \u2018Light Containment Wing.\u2019 Iron doors line the corridor, guarded by security officers wearing the same uniforms as the ones who took Evan.</p>\n<p>Sean walks by them, unnoticed. Helpful signs direct him around the facility, and soon enough, he finds a computer room. Unsurprisingly, it\u2019s full of computers, lining all four walls and covering a large island in its center. Most of the computers are being used by researchers, but a few of them are open. Sean takes a seat in one of them.</p>\n<p>I can see the screen clearly through his camera. The camera is recording, so we\u2019ll have the information we need as soon as he pulls it up.</p>\n<p>Sean starts accessing information. \u201cThere\u2019s intake data going back years,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking for February 2017,\u201d I say, as quietly as I can while still ensuring my mic will pick it up. We don\u2019t know if the sound of my voice over the microphone will be enough to break the hat\u2019s effect.</p>\n<p>Sean opens the appropriate intake records. Apparently, six SCPs were brought to this facility that month. \u201cLate in the month,\u201d I whisper. Sean attempts to access the last file.</p>\n<p>A loud buzz sounds. \u201cUnauthorized access detected.\u201d Immediately, several researchers inside the room begin looking around. None of them notice Sean. He starts working at the computer in earnest, trying to pull up the files.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure you shouldn\u2019t get out of there?\u201d I ask Sean.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have a bit of time,\u201d Sean whispers.</p>\n<p>He turns out to have about thirty seconds before four guards barge into the room. \u201cResearchers, clear out,\u201d one of them says, while the others head directly to Sean\u2019s terminal. Sean steps back. Thanks to the hat, no one in the room notices him. The researchers obey and leave the room. One of the four guards follows them out. The others stay inside, as does Sean. He positions himself so that his camera has a clear view of the monitor he\u2019d been at.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is the one that triggered the alarm?\u201d one of the Jailors asks.</p>\n<p>Another sits in front of the computer. \u201cThe seat is warm,\u201d she says. \u201cSomeone was just here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLock the door,\u201d a Jailor says. The door shuts, and, presumably, locks. Sean is trapped in there.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat files were they accessing?\u201d another Jailor asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cIntake records from 2017,\u201d says the one at the computer.</p>\n<p>\u201cAny idea what someone would want with those?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. There are six files open in this folder. Should I take a look at them?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAffirmative.\u201d</p>\n<p>And with that, they proceed to finish our work for us. One at a time, they open each of the files and scroll through them, so every word of all six files is captured on Sean\u2019s camera for us to study later.</p>\n<p>The security guard who stepped out of the room a moment ago steps back in. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to the researchers. All of them recall someone being here but can\u2019t recall anything about them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe know which SCiP does that,\u201d another guard says.</p>\n<p>\u201cThink they\u2019re still somewhere in here?\u201d one of the guards says.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey might be. Keep the room locked. Start searching.\u201d</p>\n<p>With that, the guards start systematically searching the room, arms outstretched. Sean is quickly forced away from the door by the need to dodge them, and, from there, he engages in some remarkable acrobatics to avoid their touch. The Jailors look ridiculous, slowly walking around the room with their arms outstretched, but I can see how this would be the logical way to search for an invisible enemy.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happens if one of them manages to touch him?\u201d I ask.</p>\n<p>\u201cInteraction eliminates the hat\u2019s effects,\u201d Jack says. \u201cIf they touch him, they can see him.\u201d</p>\n<p>The guards search the room efficiently. They check the space underneath and above the terminals, ensuring Sean doesn\u2019t have anywhere to hide. One of them is standing directly in front of the locked door. Sean spends most of his time on top of the terminals, using a spell to make himself supernaturally dexterous.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan he phase out the door?\u201d I ask.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Mike says.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot even with the spell he used earlier?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe phased through a mesh fence. That solid iron door has a hundred times more material.\u201d</p>\n<p>After several minutes, an electronic voice comes from the loudspeaker. \u201cFacility on lockdown,\u201d it says.</p>\n<p>Sean\u2019s fucked. There\u2019s no way he can get out of that room with this many guards in it. He can evade them for a while, but it\u2019ll only take one slip-up to reveal him to everyone there. I watch the screen for several agonizing minutes, hoping that somehow, something will go his way, and he\u2019ll be able to get out.</p>\n<p>He mistimes a leap, and bumps into one of the guards.</p>\n<p>The Jailor\u2019s attention snaps toward him, and he looks him right in the eye. Sean jumps back, to the other side of the island. \u201cHe\u2019s there!\u201d the Jailor shouts. The other guards surround the spot he indicated. The guard who saw Sean approaches him. He\u2019s too boxed in to have any hope of escaping. He grabs the hat and yanks it off Sean\u2019s head. All the guards draw their weapons and point them at Sean. \u201cStand still,\u201d one of them barks.</p>\n<p>Sean does.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s been caught. He was caught while he was trying to help me.</p>\n<p>One of the guards approaches him from behind and pulls his hands behind his back to cuff them. As he does this, the Jailor notices the glove on Sean\u2019s hand. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he asks. Sean says nothing. I keep waiting for him to utter the code phrase that he\u2019s supposed to use to call for help, but he doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u201cMind if I take this off?\u201d the guard asks. Sean doesn\u2019t answer. The guard grabs Sean\u2019s hand and rips off the thick leather glove. Two of the guards flinch and shield their eyes from the sudden light exploding from Sean\u2019s finger. Sean tries to take advantage of this to climb back over the island, but the guards recover and drag him to the ground. The Jailor who\u2019d removed the glove places it back on his hand. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll be leaving that there for now,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cShould have guessed he was a freak,\u201d another Jailor says. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones who have that stupid hat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot anymore,\u201d says the guard who snatched it, smirking.</p>\n<p>One of the guards approaches Sean from the other side, and makes eye contact with the camera. \u201cIs someone watching us?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>Sean doesn\u2019t say anything. The guard continues to approach the camera. \u201cThink we can trace it?\u201d another Jailor asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, we definitely can.\u201d He walks up to the camera. Before he can touch it, Sean suddenly jerks forward. The motion is too fast for me to tell what he\u2019s doing, but right after it, there\u2019s a loud sound, and the camera feed suddenly ends.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have to go in,\u201d I say. \u201cHe needs backup.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t ask us to come in,\u201d Mike says.</p>\n<p>\u201cObviously, he didn\u2019t want to alert them that we\u2019d be coming.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jack says. \u201cThat\u2019s what the code phrase is for. He didn\u2019t want us to come after him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t leave him!\u201d I say. \u201cWe can\u2019t just let them lock him away forever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot forever,\u201d Jack says. \u201cRescuing him while the facility is on lockdown is hopeless. We\u2019re better off coming back for him later, with a plan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe might not even be here by then!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be somewhere,\u201d Mike says, \u201cand hopefully that place won\u2019t be on full lockdown.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t leave someone behind.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe chose to risk this for our cause. That\u2019s the same choice you\u2019re making.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to trade another captive for my brother.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour brother isn\u2019t just one captive,\u201d Jack says. \u201cJust like you, he has the power to recover enormous amounts of information the Jailors have erased with amnestics.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cImagine if you were in his position,\u201d Mike says. \u201cWould you want three more people to get themselves captured charging in after you?\u201d</p>\n<p>No. I wouldn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t want to accept this. I don\u2019t want my brother\u2019s rescue to have a cost. I want my mission to be about saving someone from the Jailors, not trading one prisoner for another. The others are right, though. Going in while the facility\u2019s on lockdown is foolish. \u201cHow long?\u201d I ask. \u201cHow long will he have to wait before we go back for him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHopefully just a few weeks,\u201d Mike says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been \u2018contained\u2019 by them before,\u201d says Jack. \u201cSo has Sean. He\u2019s strong. He\u2019ll survive, and we\u2019ll come back for him. The Hand takes care of its own.\u201d</p>\n<p>He says that just before driving away, abandoning Sean to the Jailors\u2019 mercy.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>As soon as we\u2019re back in the Library, Mike, Jack and I hurry to look over the footage Sean captured. Sure enough, one of the six files those Jailors scrolled through seems to be about Evan.</p>\n<p>The file is heavily redacted, even by Jailor standards. According to my comrades, that suggests that Evan is involved with something the Jailors consider very secret. Still, the file leaves us with more information than I\u2019ve had for years, and my eyes greedily soak in every detail.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</p>\n<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Thaumiel</p>\n</div>\n<p>This isn\u2019t the first Jailor document I\u2019ve seen, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen that object class before. \u201cWhat does \u2018Thaumiel\u2019 mean?\u201d I ask.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt means they consider him useful,\u201d Mike says.</p>\n<p>\u201cUseful?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re probably forcing him to use his abilities for their benefit,\u201d Jack says.</p>\n<p>That makes me want to gag.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is held in [REDACTED] at Site-17.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Theo\u2019s first guess was right.

Every man and monster, hero and villain, every person, place, or thing you can possibly imagine, they all exist, and they\u2019re all documented by the Library.\u201d Sean reaches out with his ungloved hand to grab a small black tome off the shelf. \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d I ask.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have absolutely no idea,\u201d Sean says. \u201cYou\u2019re to read it cover to cover.\u201d\n\n\n\nI nod.\n\n\n\n\u201cNow, here\u2019s the deal with the Jailors and the Bookburners. They look at all that wonder, all the infinite majesty and glory of the multiverse, and they quake in fear. They gaze into infinite everything and see only horror. No wonder. No beauty. Nothing worth understanding or safeguarding. Only threats and anomalies that need to be contained or destroyed. They\u2019re too terrified of everything they don\u2019t understand to be able to tell the difference between a threatening \u2018anomaly\u2019 and a harmless one. To them, a neck-snapping murder monster is exactly as much of a problem as a person whose left pinky glows. They fear that the lifting of the veil will drag humanity into a new dark age, but they are the ones keeping humanity in the dark.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI understand,\u201d I say.\n\n\n\n\u201cSorry. I ramble when I get passionate.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNo. It\u2019s fine. I saw what they did to my brother. To my family.\u201d I clench my fist. \u201cMy brother was a hero. He went to the Galaxy Plaza to save people. He did save people, and because he did, they locked him in a cage forever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s perverse,\u201d Sean says. \u201cTo them, nothing he does can ever cancel out what he is.\u201d\n\n\n\nI think Sean is under the impression that he needs to radicalize me into the Serpent\u2019s Hand, and against the Jailors. He\u2019s wrong. I\u2019ve hated them since before I knew who they were. Since the day they took my brother. \u201cI want to hurt them,\u201d I say.\n\n\n\n\u201cFortunately, we hurt them just by existing.\u201d\n\n\n\nI nod. \u201cBy the way, I\u2019ve been meaning to ask, what\u2019s your anomaly? You\u2019ve mentioned having one, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever said what it is.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t joking a second ago,\u201d Sean says. He grabs the glove that always covers his left hand and pulls it off. Sure enough, his left pinky glows. It\u2019s bright. Painfully so, like staring directly into the sun. I look away. Sean puts the glove back on. \u201cIt\u2019s bright enough to hurt people,\u201d he says. \u201cI know that. That\u2019s why I wear the glove. Still, that\u2019s all that\u2019s \u2018anomalous\u2019 about me. A single piece of clothing renders me completely harmless, but it was still enough reason for the Jailors to lock me away for years.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou got caught by them?\u201d I ask.\n\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Sean says. \u201cI did.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it like?\u201d I ask. As soon as I do, I wonder if I should have. It might be a very personal question. One with lots of bad memories attached. But I can\u2019t resist information on how Evan might have been doing these past six years. I need to know if it\u2019s as bad as I\u2019ve been imagining. If it\u2019s somehow worse.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a prison,\u201d Sean says. \u201cNot that different from any other. You spend most of your time alone in a cell. Depending on how dangerous they think you are, and how well you behave, you might be allowed a bit of time out to commune with other prisoners. You might even be allowed into the yard, if they\u2019re confident you can\u2019t get over the fence.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe boredom was intolerable. You can get access to entertainment, if you behave, but you can\u2019t do anything that matters. Nothing you make can ever leave the site. There\u2019s nothing you can do to help anyone. To make any kind of difference in anything. Every second, you can feel your life being wasted. The knowledge that you don\u2019t matter, that you\u2019re being kept from mattering, erodes your soul.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry you had to go through that,\u201d I say.\n\n\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s why the Hand exists. That\u2019s why we won\u2019t rest until everyone they\u2019ve imprisoned is free.\u201d\n\n\n\nI look down. \u201cEvan is probably miserable in there in there,\u201d I say. \u201cHe was always someone who wanted to make a difference. Who liked to help other people.\u201d\n\n\n\nI feel a hand on my shoulder. I look back over at Sean. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m out, now. The Serpent\u2019s Hand broke into my site and freed me. Soon, we\u2019re going to do the same for your brother.\u201d\n\n\n\nI nod.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s like you\u2014\u201d Sean begins.\n\n\n\n\u201cBetter,\u201d I say. \u201cHe has my powers, and he\u2019s better at magic than I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d\n\n\n\nSean smiles. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll do great work together, if he\u2019s interested in joining the Hand.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll want to join. He\u2019s already a hero.\u201d\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re ready?\u201d Sean asks.\n\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I say. I\u2019m as ready as anyone can be for a mission like this. The Serpent\u2019s Hand have spent months preparing me for the role I\u2019ll play.\n\n\n\n\u201cGood.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t the mission to rescue Evan. We still need to figure out what site he\u2019s being kept at. This mission is about stealing that information. Sean is going to break into Site-272. I\u2019ll be part of the team monitoring him remotely, and my advice will help guide him toward information relevant to my brother.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s quite a handy little artifact that he\u2019s using to infiltrate the base. It\u2019s this old-style hat that makes you functionally invisible to the people around you. Unfortunately for me, it doesn\u2019t make you literally invisible, but, rather, generates a mental effect that forces everyone to ignore you. My presence negates mental effects, so I can\u2019t be the one to wear it and sneak inside. That\u2019s why Sean\u2019s going. My job will be to stand by with the other agents, advise him on finding information relevant to my brother, and be nearby in case he calls for backup.\n\n\n\n\u201cBefore we go,\u201d I say. \u201cI just want to say thanks, for all of this. You\u2019ve done a lot for me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what we do,\u201d Sean says.\n\n\n\nI nod. I\u2019ve already started to work on making it up to them. My ability to undo amnestics is very useful, both because of the intelligence it can gather, and because it allows me to free people from their Jailor-imposed ignorance.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe need to remember not to underestimate the Jailors,\u201d Sean says \u201cThe hat is powerful, but it is something they\u2019ve encountered before. Even with its help, there\u2019s no guarantee I\u2019ll remain undetected.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cUnderstood.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAlright. Time to head out.\u201d\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re waiting in a small van. Besides me and Sean, there\u2019s Mike, who isn\u2019t anomalous, and Jack, whose bright blue skin makes him the most visibly strange out of our group. We\u2019re as close as we can get to Site-272 without raising any suspicion, which means we\u2019re over a mile away. If Sean calls for backup, we\u2019ll have a lot of distance to cover.\n\n\n\nSean\u2019s wearing a camera. The three of us are gathered in front of a live feed. \u201cPreparations are complete,\u201d Sean says. He\u2019s dressed like a Jailor researcher, with a fake Foundation ID card. In the event something goes wrong with the hat, we\u2019re hoping it will still seem like he\u2019s supposed to be there. \u201cEverything\u2019s a-go.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe rest of us express our assent. Sean starts walking toward the facility.\n\n\n\nSean already used the hat to case the outside of Site-272. Using the intelligence gathered from that trip, he\u2019s able to take advantage of a small gap in the security camera\u2019s coverage. He casts a spell that allows him to phase through the site\u2019s fence, then uses his ID card on a side entrance to get inside the building.\n\n\n\nI study the facility as Sean walks through it. It\u2019s a sterile, white place, bathed in bright florescent light. Sean has walked into a \u2018Light Containment Wing.\u2019 Iron doors line the corridor, guarded by security officers wearing the same uniforms as the ones who took Evan.\n\n\n\nSean walks by them, unnoticed. Helpful signs direct him around the facility, and soon enough, he finds a computer room. Unsurprisingly, it\u2019s full of computers, lining all four walls and covering a large island in its center. Most of the computers are being used by researchers, but a few of them are open. Sean takes a seat in one of them.\n\n\n\nI can see the screen clearly through his camera. The camera is recording, so we\u2019ll have the information we need as soon as he pulls it up.\n\n\n\nSean starts accessing information. \u201cThere\u2019s intake data going back years,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking for February 2017,\u201d I say, as quietly as I can while still ensuring my mic will pick it up. We don\u2019t know if the sound of my voice over the microphone will be enough to break the hat\u2019s effect.\n\n\n\nSean opens the appropriate intake records. Apparently, six SCPs were brought to this facility that month. \u201cLate in the month,\u201d I whisper. Sean attempts to access the last file.\n\n\n\nA loud buzz sounds. \u201cUnauthorized access detected.\u201d Immediately, several researchers inside the room begin looking around. None of them notice Sean. He starts working at the computer in earnest, trying to pull up the files.\n\n\n\n\u201cAre you sure you shouldn\u2019t get out of there?\u201d I ask Sean.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have a bit of time,\u201d Sean whispers.\n\n\n\nHe turns out to have about thirty seconds before four guards barge into the room. \u201cResearchers, clear out,\u201d one of them says, while the others head directly to Sean\u2019s terminal. Sean steps back. Thanks to the hat, no one in the room notices him. The researchers obey and leave the room. One of the four guards follows them out. The others stay inside, as does Sean. He positions himself so that his camera has a clear view of the monitor he\u2019d been at.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is the one that triggered the alarm?\u201d one of the Jailors asks.\n\n\n\nAnother sits in front of the computer. \u201cThe seat is warm,\u201d she says. \u201cSomeone was just here.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cLock the door,\u201d a Jailor says. The door shuts, and, presumably, locks. Sean is trapped in there.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat files were they accessing?\u201d another Jailor asks.\n\n\n\n\u201cIntake records from 2017,\u201d says the one at the computer.\n\n\n\n\u201cAny idea what someone would want with those?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNo. There are six files open in this folder. Should I take a look at them?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAffirmative.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd with that, they proceed to finish our work for us. One at a time, they open each of the files and scroll through them, so every word of all six files is captured on Sean\u2019s camera for us to study later.\n\n\n\nThe security guard who stepped out of the room a moment ago steps back in. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to the researchers. All of them recall someone being here but can\u2019t recall anything about them.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe know which SCiP does that,\u201d another guard says.\n\n\n\n\u201cThink they\u2019re still somewhere in here?\u201d one of the guards says.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey might be. Keep the room locked. Start searching.\u201d\n\n\n\nWith that, the guards start systematically searching the room, arms outstretched. Sean is quickly forced away from the door by the need to dodge them, and, from there, he engages in some remarkable acrobatics to avoid their touch. The Jailors look ridiculous, slowly walking around the room with their arms outstretched, but I can see how this would be the logical way to search for an invisible enemy.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat happens if one of them manages to touch him?\u201d I ask.\n\n\n\n\u201cInteraction eliminates the hat\u2019s effects,\u201d Jack says. \u201cIf they touch him, they can see him.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe guards search the room efficiently. They check the space underneath and above the terminals, ensuring Sean doesn\u2019t have anywhere to hide. One of them is standing directly in front of the locked door. Sean spends most of his time on top of the terminals, using a spell to make himself supernaturally dexterous.\n\n\n\n\u201cCan he phase out the door?\u201d I ask.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Mike says.\n\n\n\n\u201cNot even with the spell he used earlier?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHe phased through a mesh fence. That solid iron door has a hundred times more material.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter several minutes, an electronic voice comes from the loudspeaker. \u201cFacility on lockdown,\u201d it says.\n\n\n\nSean\u2019s fucked. There\u2019s no way he can get out of that room with this many guards in it. He can evade them for a while, but it\u2019ll only take one slip-up to reveal him to everyone there. I watch the screen for several agonizing minutes, hoping that somehow, something will go his way, and he\u2019ll be able to get out.\n\n\n\nHe mistimes a leap, and bumps into one of the guards. \n\n\n\nThe Jailor\u2019s attention snaps toward him, and he looks him right in the eye. Sean jumps back, to the other side of the island. \u201cHe\u2019s there!\u201d the Jailor shouts. The other guards surround the spot he indicated. The guard who saw Sean approaches him. He\u2019s too boxed in to have any hope of escaping. He grabs the hat and yanks it off Sean\u2019s head. All the guards draw their weapons and point them at Sean. \u201cStand still,\u201d one of them barks.\n\n\n\nSean does.\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s been caught. He was caught while he was trying to help me.\n\n\n\nOne of the guards approaches him from behind and pulls his hands behind his back to cuff them. As he does this, the Jailor notices the glove on Sean\u2019s hand. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he asks. Sean says nothing. I keep waiting for him to utter the code phrase that he\u2019s supposed to use to call for help, but he doesn\u2019t.\n\n\n\n\u201cMind if I take this off?\u201d the guard asks. Sean doesn\u2019t answer. The guard grabs Sean\u2019s hand and rips off the thick leather glove. Two of the guards flinch and shield their eyes from the sudden light exploding from Sean\u2019s finger. Sean tries to take advantage of this to climb back over the island, but the guards recover and drag him to the ground. The Jailor who\u2019d removed the glove places it back on his hand. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll be leaving that there for now,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n\u201cShould have guessed he was a freak,\u201d another Jailor says. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones who have that stupid hat.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNot anymore,\u201d says the guard who snatched it, smirking.\n\n\n\nOne of the guards approaches Sean from the other side, and makes eye contact with the camera. \u201cIs someone watching us?\u201d he asks.\n\n\n\nSean doesn\u2019t say anything. The guard continues to approach the camera. \u201cThink we can trace it?\u201d another Jailor asks.\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, we definitely can.\u201d He walks up to the camera. Before he can touch it, Sean suddenly jerks forward. The motion is too fast for me to tell what he\u2019s doing, but right after it, there\u2019s a loud sound, and the camera feed suddenly ends. \n\n\n\n\u201cWe have to go in,\u201d I say. \u201cHe needs backup.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t ask us to come in,\u201d Mike says.\n\n\n\n\u201cObviously, he didn\u2019t want to alert them that we\u2019d be coming.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Jack says. \u201cThat\u2019s what the code phrase is for. He didn\u2019t want us to come after him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t leave him!\u201d I say. \u201cWe can\u2019t just let them lock him away forever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNot forever,\u201d Jack says. \u201cRescuing him while the facility is on lockdown is hopeless. We\u2019re better off coming back for him later, with a plan.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHe might not even be here by then!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be somewhere,\u201d Mike says, \u201cand hopefully that place won\u2019t be on full lockdown.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t leave someone behind.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHe chose to risk this for our cause. That\u2019s the same choice you\u2019re making.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to trade another captive for my brother.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYour brother isn\u2019t just one captive,\u201d Jack says. \u201cJust like you, he has the power to recover enormous amounts of information the Jailors have erased with amnestics.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cImagine if you were in his position,\u201d Mike says. \u201cWould you want three more people to get themselves captured charging in after you?\u201d\n\n\n\nNo. I wouldn\u2019t.\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t want to accept this. I don\u2019t want my brother\u2019s rescue to have a cost. I want my mission to be about saving someone from the Jailors, not trading one prisoner for another. The others are right, though. Going in while the facility\u2019s on lockdown is foolish. \u201cHow long?\u201d I ask. \u201cHow long will he have to wait before we go back for him?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHopefully just a few weeks,\u201d Mike says.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been \u2018contained\u2019 by them before,\u201d says Jack. \u201cSo has Sean. He\u2019s strong. He\u2019ll survive, and we\u2019ll come back for him. The Hand takes care of its own.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe says that just before driving away, abandoning Sean to the Jailors\u2019 mercy.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nAs soon as we\u2019re back in the Library, Mike, Jack and I hurry to look over the footage Sean captured. Sure enough, one of the six files those Jailors scrolled through seems to be about Evan.\n\n\n\nThe file is heavily redacted, even by Jailor standards. According to my comrades, that suggests that Evan is involved with something the Jailors consider very secret. Still, the file leaves us with more information than I\u2019ve had for years, and my eyes greedily soak in every detail.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Item #:** SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n\n\n**Object Class:** Thaumiel\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first Jailor document I\u2019ve seen, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen that object class before. \u201cWhat does \u2018Thaumiel\u2019 mean?\u201d I ask.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt means they consider him useful,\u201d Mike says.\n\n\n\n\u201cUseful?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re probably forcing him to use his abilities for their benefit,\u201d Jack says.\n\n\n\nThat makes me want to gag.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is held in [REDACTED] at Site-17.\n\n[[/div]] \n\n\n\nTheo\u2019s first guess was right.

[DATA EXPUGED] SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 possesses an extreme resistance to cognitohazardous, infohazardous, and other mind-affecting anomalies. SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s Cognitive Resistance Score has been measured to be 358.9, the highest ever recorded.\n\n\n\nIn addition, interactions with SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 raise the cognitive resistance of individuals around it.\n\n[[/div]] \n\n\n\nIt.

Gears answered as honestly as he could bear.</em></p>\n<p><em>Kondraki was loud spoken, radical, unafraid to make his grievances clear, but as loyal as Gears himself. He cared for the Foundation\u2019s principles as much as he cared for the people who worked for them, and the people in containment.</em></p>\n<p><em>He could admit, at least in his head, that he had a certain admiration for Kondraki.

Kondraki squeezes himself into a tighter ball.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna kill me for this, right?\u201d Kondraki whimpers, eyes fearfully darting around the room. Choking on a sob, he finds no tears left for him to cry.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cI have not been sent to kill you. Not yet\u2026 Would you allow me to see what you have?\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>Sniveling, Kondraki attempts to wipe his face with his sleeve, only smearing the blood.

Gears takes it, finding a certain satisfaction in confirming the death of 083 firsthand.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cI thought I could\u2026 fix him. I thought- at least if he killed me\u2026 I\u2019d see it coming.\u201d Kondraki\u2019s hands are shaking.

He got enough entertainment terrorizing a few junior researchers or his assistant Adams. For the most part, he was fine with the silence. Numb to it even.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not as though he even eats lunch in the cafeteria anymore, or at all for that matter. There\u2019s no longer any satisfaction in eating; no warmth to be gained. It\u2019s starting to show in his cheeks; in the hollowness of his eyes.</p>\n<p>At least he\u2019s remained productive.

That\u2019s who he needs to forget right now. He needs to forget everything about him.</p>\n<p>Sitting in his office, Adams silent beside him, Clef feels a headache prodding at his temples.

Clef thought he was supposed to be the devil, but here Gears was, staring him down.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, miss\u2026\u201d Gears trials off, focusing his attention on Clef. Clef bares his teeth at Gears in a mock grin. They spend a solid minute staring each other down like alley cats.</p>\n<p>Gears clears his throat. \u201cDr. Clef, would you come to my office?

His expression, as usual, is blank, but Clef can see something in his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI believe that you should move in with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>The phrase catches Clef so off guard he chokes on his drink. He feels the back of his nose burn. He wipes the spittle dripping from his lips and coughs out a cackle.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Gears offers out a handkerchief like Clef wants to wipe his face with a gross cloth Gears totes around everywhere.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re funny. I kiss you once while drunk and you think I\u2019m in love with you or something? Bet you asked Iceberg\u2019s hand in marriage after the first date too!\u201d</p>\n<p>Gears bites the inside of his lip, it\u2019s subtle but it shows that Clef\u2019s clawed under his skin. Clef wonders if Gears is about to try to strangle him again. He almost wishes he would, at least <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/supplemental-report-239-b-192\">physical violence is something he\u2019s familiar with</a>.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo\u2026 Iceberg and I never discussed the possibility of marriage. My proposition has very little to do with your actions the other night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh? But not nothing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Gears purses his lips. \u201cYou have been on a self destructive streak, as of the past few months. The incident in question was only one of many things that led me to this <em>decision</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Decision,</em> that\u2019s a <em>real</em> funny word to describe a request. That caged animal feeling returns, stronger this time. Clef feels faint, he digs in nails into his desk to focus. Sweat dripping down his forehead, he grins, showing off too many teeth.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m some man-child that can\u2019t care for himself?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I believe you are choosing to be self-destructive and it is negatively affecting your work and behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef almost snorts. He\u2019s always been unpleasant, prided himself in it even, and he knows his work is good. No, <em>no this is personal</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in being babysat. Is that enough for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Gears shifts, straightening out. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you might be misunderstanding my proposition. If I was looking to restrict your autonomy, I could simply have you contained.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef\u2019s eye twitches. \u201cOh really?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOne report, and believe me, I have several, of erratic and potentially harmful behavior and there would be no question.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef sways, catching himself before he can fall forward and smack his head on his desk. He can\u2019t can\u2019t fill his lungs all the way. Gears stares him down, intentions clear. On the verge of tears, Clef keeps his disingenuous smile on.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that a threat, Charlie?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, simply a <em>reminder</em>. As you can see, I have no intentions of doing so.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef could try weaseling his way out of this, he\u2019s a professional weaseler, but Gears really has him pinned here. What kind of cage does he want? A small humanoid cell, or a comfortable yet suffocating <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span> on the edge of nowhere with <em>him</em>?</p>\n<p><em>Is there really any choice at all?</em></p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Clef says, an air of resignation in his voice. He lets the tension out of his shoulders. He struggles to look Gears in the eyes, staring straight through his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll move in with you.\u201d He\u2019s gotten used to plenty of cages, he\u2019s due for a fresh one.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Gears says, with a curt nod. \u201cWe can discuss the details at a later point. I\u2019ll have a moving van at your home soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCool.\u201d Without his input his eyes slide down to stare at his desk.</p>\n<p>\u201cI will take my leave now. Thank you for your time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gears stands, pushes the chair back into place, and leaves. He opens the door to reveal Adams mid-retreat. Seeing her is almost a breath of fresh air for Clef, relief washes over him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s rather rude of you to eavesdrop,\u201d Gears says through his teeth.</p>\n<p>Adams swallows. \u201cSorry, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI expect better from those here.\u201d Gears scoots past her and disappears from Clef\u2019s view.</p>\n<p>Clef can\u2019t help but grin at her. His usual, predatory sneer, with an air of genuinity behind it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, Adams, <em>don\u2019t you know eavesdropping is rude?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>On a plastic chair out on his front porch, Clef watches a moving van pull into his driveway. Up until this point Clef could convince himself that Gears was fucking with him. Even as he was packing his few precious belongings into boxes he told himself that Gears <em>would</em> change his mind.</p>\n<p>From his <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span> in Cornwall, to the cramped GOC bunkers, to living out of the back of his truck\u2026 This cabin, in all of its run down glory, is the first home he\u2019s ever truly had to himself. There\u2019s more of <em>him</em> in that <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span> than there is anywhere else.</p>\n<p>Leaving this place he feels like he\u2019s leaving pieces of himself behind.</p>\n<p>While Gears\u2019s hires feed his life into the back of the moving van, Clef\u2019s <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/784incident3\">Little Shit of a cat</a>, <em>\u2018affectionately\u2019</em> called L.S. for short, waddles outside. It hops into Clef\u2019s lap, uselessly flopping over. Clef runs his fingers through its fur, smiling to himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a single clue what\u2019s going on, do you?\u201d He scratches behind L.S.\u2019s ear. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019re not going back to the streets.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gears\u2019s <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span>, which he supposes is his <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span> now too, is grayer than he remembers. With L.S. tucked under one arm and his box of personal items tucked under the other, he\u2019s the most colorful thing in this place.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want my own room,\u201d he says, looking Gears in the eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have several unoccupied rooms upstairs. You may have your\u2026\u201d Gears trails off, eyes locking onto the <em>thing</em> Clef is holding. Clef grins, squeezing L.S. possessively.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou brought your\u2026 cat,\u201d Gears says, sounding awfully unsure at the word <em>cat</em>. Clef could see a wrinkle form on his forehead.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018Course. Was I just supposed to leave it to fend for itself? What do you take me for?\u201d Clef holds L.S. out to Gears. <em>You forced me into your <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span>, now you get everything that comes with me</em>.</p>\n<p>L.S. is a fuzzy brownish-orange thing, with graying, matted fur, a missing eye, and always some kind of goop coming out of its nose or mouth. Clef found it in his garbage can and took it in, assuming it was going to die pretty quickly anyway. That was almost ten years ago, and the damn thing hasn\u2019t died yet.</p>\n<p>\u201cMerow,\u201d L.S. says. Clef sets it down and it takes a few shaky steps forward before it flops over at Gears\u2019s feet. Gears takes a step back, steeling his nerves.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is\u2026 vaccinated\u2026 correct?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEh? Probably.\u201d Clef shrugs with a grin. He <em>is</em> pretty sure L.S. is as healthy as a ten to fifteen year old cat could be, but leaving an air of mystery about it is funnier.</p>\n<p>\u201cI see.\u201d Gears scowls. \u201cAs long as you continue to take care of it\u2026 You may pick a room upstairs for both of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Box in hand, he heads upstairs, which is somehow even more barren and prison-like than downstairs. L.S. prattles along after him, following him into one of the empty rooms.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s small, about the same size as his old bedroom. The only light streams through one measly window, which looks out to an empty street. It\u2019s deafly silent. Clef takes a seat under the window and wonders if he\u2019ll ever get used to this place.</p>\n<p>L.S. curls up beside him. At least the rumble of its purrs are familiar, comforting even.</p>\n<p>\u201cWish I could adapt as easily as you.\u201d Clef pulls his ukulele out of his box. L.S. jumps in, putting itself among Clef\u2019s other irreplaceables. Clef <em>tsks</em> and shakes his head.</p>\n<p>At least one of them would be comfortable here.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Over the next couple of weeks Clef watches as Gears <em>thoroughly</em> inserts himself into Clef\u2019s life. Clef comes to work one day to find his office on the other side of the site, and he finds himself eating lunch in Gears\u2019s office. Soon they\u2019re carpooling to work and home everyday and Clef can feel himself slipping.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not as though Gears treats him <em>bad</em>. It\u2019s just that Gears is so <em>predictable</em>. Within a week Clef knows exactly how to avoid him. At least with Kondraki-</p>\n<p>Clef cuts the thought off before it finishes. He would rather not think about Kondraki right now, or ever again.</p>\n<p>Two plates in hand, Gears enters the dining room and places one before him. Always some bland slop that\u2019s probably designed to be <em>\u2018healthy\u2019</em> or whatever. Gears won\u2019t let him anywhere near the stove so this is what he\u2019s stuck with.</p>\n<p>Gears stops before his seat and stares down at something.</p>\n<p>\u201cClef\u2026 would you please move your cat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust give \u2018em a little nudge and it\u2019ll fuck off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you please move it?\u201d Clef can hear him breathing. <em>What\u2019s his fucking problem?</em></p>\n<p>\u201cScared of a little cat?\u201d Clef scoops L.S. up. He\u2019s about to put it upstairs when another thought occurs to him. He cracks open Gears\u2019s bedroom and nudges L.S. in.</p>\n<p>A half hour later, Gears enters his bedroom and spots the <em>Little Shit</em> making a home in his bed. The thought of all those <em>tiny, greasy, loose hairs</em> all over his bed makes his <em>skin crawl</em> and his stomach twist.</p>\n<p><em>How long has that thing been in here? Has it touched anything else? Oh god, there could be tiny fucking hairs everywhere.</em> His sanctuary has been violated. Gears is going to faint.</p>\n<p>\u201cClef?\u201d he calls out, his nausea leaking into his voice. He can see L.S. nuzzling into his pillow, smearing its snot all over.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeeeessss, Coggy dear?\u201d Clef slides up next to him. He\u2019s disappointed to find that L.S. didn\u2019t break anything.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cGet your cat out of my room,\u201d</em> he almost hisses.</p>\n<p>Clef shows off his teeth. \u201cI dunno, it looks pretty comfortable in there. I would hate to disturb it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gears clenches his fists. \u201cClef, may I remind you this is <em>my</em> space? If you can not keep your cat out of here I might have to-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave to what? Throw us back to the streets? Be my fucking guest.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s being toyed with, he knows he\u2019s being toyed with, but the longer Clef plays this game the more <em>cat</em> rubs off on his bed. He wishes his stomach would <em>make up its fucking mind</em> on whether he\u2019s going to throw up or not. If he vomits onto Clef right now at least this game would stop.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cPerhaps-\u201d</em> he grinds his teeth together, \u201c-if you can not handle your animal then you do not deserve to keep it.\u201d</p>\n<p>The smug look drips off of Clef\u2019s face. \u201cI swear to <em>fuck</em>, Charles, if you throw my cat out-\u201d</p>\n<p>Gears wants to hit him. Gears want to hit him so fucking bad right now. Anything to get him to shut up shut up shut up shut up <em>shut up shut up shutupshutupshutupshutupshutup!</em></p>\n<p>He puts a hand on Clef\u2019s shoulder and squeezes. Clef cuts himself off.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet your cat out of my room\u2026 <em>Please.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>That seems to satisfy him, at least enough for him to grab his cat and leave. Gears rushes in to strip the bed and lent roll the sheets. <em>Ugh- it\u2019s no use! He\u2019ll have to put them through the wash</em>. Waiting for the laundry to finish will throw off his usual bedtime but he\u2019ll never sleep if he doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Waiting for the laundry gives him time to vacuum and scrub down the rest of his room. He can\u2019t see them but he <em>knows</em> there's cat hairs everywhere. He makes his usual walk around the <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span> to check all of the locks before wheeling the vacuum into his bedroom.</p>\n<p>From his place on the stairs, Clef thinks Gears looks crazy running around the place like that. Gears was never as fun to provoke as <em>that guy that should not be spoken about.</em></p>\n<p>Gears exits his bedroom, relieved to have his space sanitized. He swaps the wash into the dryer and decides he can get a headstart on his work tomorrow while that-</p>\n<p><em>The front door is unlocked.</em></p>\n<p>The door was locked, he knows that he locked it. He swears he already made his usual walk around the <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span>.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s fine\u2026 This is fine. He can relock the door. He must\u2019ve just misremembered. <em>Just misremembered</em>.</p>\n<p>The windows are unlocked too, a few of them were partly open. When did he open them? Maybe he didn\u2019t. He\u2019s slipping.</p>\n<p>He makes a second trip around the close. This time he\u2019s sure he\u2019s locked up the entire h-</p>\n<p><em>The door.</em></p>\n<p>This is fine. This <em>is</em> fine. <em>This</em> is fine. This is <em>fine</em>.</p>\n<p>He locks the door. He\u2019s sure that he\u2019s locked the door. The door is locked and he\u2019s the one who\u2019s locked it. He takes a step back and examines his locked door, which is locked.</p>\n<p>Still forty minutes on the dryer. He enters his office and the window is open. He slams the window shut and storms out of his office in time to catch Clef unlocking the front door.</p>\n<p>\u201cClef!\u201d He doesn\u2019t shout. <em>Fuck</em>, it\u2019s almost a relief it\u2019s just Clef being an asshole. Gears would still like to bash his skull in.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh? Oh hey, Cog!\u201d Clef looks him in the eyes while sliding the chain-lock undone.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh this? I was just going to step out for some fresh air! This place could use some ventilation! I mean <em>pop open a window</em> for something!\u201d</p>\n<p>Gears is going to start hyperventilating. His cheeks are already flushed. Clef keeps grinning at him. <em>This is fucking hilarious to him.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cOh calm down, Charles!\" says Clef. \"<em>It\u2019s not that big of a deal,\u201d says Iceberg. He has a hole in his head and his brain is spilling onto the carpet. That\u2019s the only way Gears can picture him anymore.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cYou broke into <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/epitaph\">my private office</a>. I wish you would have just asked.\u201d They\u2019re sitting at the kitchen table. Iceberg leans back in his chair, arms crossed. It feels like they\u2019re in an interrogation room.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to ask.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make it okay.\u201d Gears\u2019s eyes soften, a small but genuine expression he wouldn\u2019t dare to show to anyone else.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cOh what does it matter to you! I didn\u2019t take anything! I was just looking!\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cLooking for what?\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>Iceberg crosses his arms, refusing to look him in the eyes.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cIceberg\u2026 If something is the matter you\u2019re supposed to talk to me.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cYou sound like a fucking robot when you talk like that! You can\u2019t even pretend like you actually give a shit!\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>Gears doesn\u2019t flinch, though he almost does. It feels like a dagger has been rammed through his chest.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cI do care.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cDo you? Or are you just programmed to say that?\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>Gears stands up, his sympathy melting into bitterness. \u201cIs that why you thought it was okay to invade my privacy? Because I\u2019m simply an android? Less than human to you?\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>Iceberg bites his lip. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cBut you thought it, you thought it enough to stay it outloud.\u201d Gears wants to drive his head through the wall. \u201cI\u2019m going to bed.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cUh Cog?\u201d</p>\n<p>Gears blinks and focuses on Clef. They\u2019re closer now, Gears has him almost pinned to the door. He\u2019d apparently stepped closer while lost in thought. What was he just thinking about anyway?</p>\n<p>The door, that\u2019s right. He reaches past Clef and slides each lock back into place. Clef sweats.</p>\n<p>\u201cBed\u2026 Right, I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d Gears turns his back and marches away.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Mold grows in the <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span>. Not just in the cups and plastic bottles Clef hides and collects like some kind of game. It grows in the walls, between the floorboards, under the tiles, inside of Gears himself, though he doesn\u2019t know it yet.</p>\n<p>In the months Clef has spent in Gears\u2019s home the mold has begun to grow in him too. He can feel it, even if he doesn\u2019t know what it is yet. He\u2019s a man who knows what it\u2019s like when a <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span> starts to live in you.</p>\n<p>Gears is in the kitchen, cleaning the stockpile of glasses he extracted from Clef's room. There\u2019s no point in chastising Clef over it, not anymore.</p>\n<p>Clef stares at the table and scratches his name into its surface with his nail. Gears can hear the grading sound from the kitchen. He <em>wants</em> to restrain Clef but he <em>needs</em> to finish cleaning.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to go out for drinks,\u201d Clef announces.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have alcohol here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to drink here. I\u2019m going out.\u201d It\u2019s been a while since he\u2019s gone out in his truck. He stands up and heads upstairs to get his keys.</p>\n<p>Gears trembles but says nothing. Moments later he hears Clef storm back down the stairs.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere are my car keys!?\u201d</p>\n<p>Gears thinks of a locked box hidden in Clef\u2019s closet. He pats his pants pocket, finding Clef\u2019s keys there. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Have you misplaced them?\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef growls. \u201cWhere did you put them?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t touched them,\u201d Gears lies, \u201cperhaps if you can\u2019t find your keys you should say in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGive me <em>your</em> keys.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will do <em>no</em> such thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>As Gears finishes washing their dishes Clef storms into the kitchen. He jams his hand onto Gears\u2019s pocket, causing Gears to flinch and drop a glass. It shatters on the floor. Gears spins around to rip Clef\u2019s hand away and slams him into the counter, but not before Clef gets his hands on his keys.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo. Not. Do. That.\u201d Gears holds him there, glaring into his eyes, edge of the counter digging into Clef\u2019s spine. His heart hammers, his entire body shaking. Clef shrinks.</p>\n<p>\"I thought <em>I</em> was supposed to be the liar here,\" Clef growls. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any right to keep me here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf it concerns your safety, it does.\u201d He thinks of walking into Kondraki\u2019s office to the smell of blood, he thinks of dragging a delirious Clef out of a bar. Bile crawls up his throat.</p>\n<p>Clef wants to sink his teeth into Gears\u2019s shoulder. He could, he really could, but then what? Clef could get away with subtlety, the little things that drive Gears insane, but could he get away with something so violent?</p>\n<p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll drink your bullshit.\u201d Clef pockets his keys and wriggles out of Gears\u2019s grasp.</p>\n<p>Gears straightens up, peeling himself away. He backs up and begins to clean up the shattered glass. Clef scoots around him to grab a bottle of room temperature beer. It wasn\u2019t the shitty stuff that reminded him of Kondraki, nor was it particularly good, it was\u2026 fine.</p>\n<p>Clef sips at the foam, watching Gears work. The glass slips from his sweaty hand. He tries to catch it, only managing to smack it towards Gears.</p>\n<p>The bottle shatters.</p>\n<p>Everything stops.</p>\n<p>Gears watches, unmoving, as the puddle of beer streams into the mess of glass and his shoes. Slowly, he looks up at Clef. Clef can\u2019t help but crack a grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cOops.\u201d He grabs another battle and smacks it off the counter. Gears grinds his teeth.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you hope to accomplish with this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d Clef maintains eye contact as he drops another bottle. \u201cOh! Silly me! You know how clumsy I can be!\u201d</p>\n<p>The sound of breaking glass makes Gears\u2019s hair stand on end. He stands up, cracks his neck, and goes to dump the shards in his hand. He is <em>fine</em>, he is <em>not</em> that bothered, he can handle this.</p>\n<p>Another bottle breaks. The entire room stinks, the alcohol burns his eyes. Before Gears knows what he\u2019s doing, he\u2019s ripping a bottle from Clef\u2019s grubby fingers. The feeling of taking that bottle and smashing it over Clef\u2019s thick skull is the best thing Gears has felt in ages.</p>\n<p>Then, the moment passes. Gears stands there, gripping the neck of the bottle so tightly it strains his arm. Clef is drenched, glass shards in his hair, blood and beer running down his face. His eyes are wide and wet with tears.</p>\n<p><em>For a moment he\u2019s standing over Iceberg. Oh God, oh God! He just took a chunk out of Iceberg\u2019s head. He feels so fucking sick.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you just be good?\u201d Gears gasps, desperation and fury crawling into his voice. \u201cAm I not kind to you? Have I not cared for you?\u201d He drops the bottle, letting it clang against the floor.</p>\n<p>Clef stays silent. Gears forces himself not to cry, his throat already aches from shouting. He goes to his room, resisting the urge to kick L.S. out of the way, and collapses onto his bedroom floor.</p>\n<p>He hears Clef walking around, the sound of running water in the bathroom, and then the sound of Clef\u2019s truck leaving the driveway. Once Gears is sure he\u2019s alone, once everything settles down, once the stench from the kitchen wafts into Gears\u2019s space, Gears screams.</p>\n<p>He screams his throat raw, letting the angry, painful tears run down his face. He throws his night stand over, tears the photos from his wall, throws a vase at L.S., and he wonders why he can\u2019t just be <em>good enough</em> for Clef.</p>\n<p><em>Why doesn\u2019t he get what Clef has? They\u2019re so similar and yet Clef is so cruel to him! So selfish. Gears can\u2019t see the animal he\u2019s caged, only the claws and teeth as they sink into him.</em></p>\n<p>Once he\u2019s calmed down he\u2019s left with a ruined kitchen, a ruined bedroom, and a terrified cat. He feels ragged, sick to his stomach. He hunches over the bathroom sink and spits up only bile.</p>\n<p>He walks into the kitchen and begins picking up the largest shards. The feeling of warm, sticky beer against his skin makes him want to cry, but he <em>has</em> to do this. The shards slice into his fingers, but that pain is better than whatever consequence awaits him if he doesn\u2019t do this.</p>\n<p>When the glass is gone he drops to his hands and knees, a towel and sponge in hand, and scrubs the floor until it sparkles, <em>until the sponge turns black with mold</em>. Soap seeps into the cuts but at least no one would ever be able to tell what happened here.</p>\n<p>He locks L.S. in Clef\u2019s room and returns to his own, taking similar care to pick the place clean. His body aches, the even the action of reaching out and flexing his fingers is agonizing. Exhaustion weighs on him, but he knows he can\u2019t sleep. Not like this, not in this state, not until he's done.</p>\n<p>As he picks up his nightstand to set it upright, a drawer slides open. Quickly, Gears shuts it. He hears something rattle inside and, after a moment of thought, slowly reopens the drawer.</p>\n<p>A bottle of pills sits there, sleeping meds. Gears grabs the bottle, finding it almost completely full. He was recommended these a long time ago, but never used them as he would always sleep longer than intended.</p>\n<p>\u2026 <em>always sleep longer than intended\u2026</em></p>\n<p>Gears returns to his kitchen, fills a glass with water, and drops one single pill in. The pill fizzes, bubbles, and dissolves. He takes a spoon, stirs, and finds he can barely tell the difference.</p>\n<p>He takes a small sip and holds it in his mouth, shifting it around to get a feel for it. There\u2019s a slight texture, something he might notice but Clef\u2026</p>\n<p>Gears spits the drugged water out, dumps and washes the cup, and drops a new pill in a fresh glass of water. He walks upstairs and carefully, as to not let L.S. escape, he leaves the glass on Clef\u2019s nightstand.</p>\n<p>The next morning Gears finds Clef fast asleep, the glass drained. He attempts, half-heartedly, to wake him, with no success. Gears nods to himself, takes the empty glass, and closes the door behind him.</p>\n<p>He can write an excuse for Clef\u2019s absence, it would just be one time in the name of science. Once he had a routine down he could have Clef asleep more than he\u2019s awake. He slashes the tires on Clef\u2019s truck before he leaves, just as a precaution.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Clef opens his eyes. <em>Fuck, what time is it?</em> His hangovers are getting worse. He rapidly blinks the exhaustion out. He was just in a bar- <em>wait no-</em> he was just in Gears\u2019s kitchen- <em>no, no the kitchen was first\u2026 what was he doing in Gears\u2019s kitchen?</em></p>\n<p>He remembers\u2026 breaking glass\u2026 room temperature beer\u2026 being <em>afraid</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cSir?\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef jumps. He\u2019s in his office. <em>When the hell did he get in his office?</em> What is he doing here? Pen in his hand, paper on his desk\u2026 he was writing something? What was he writing? The words blur together. Adams is beside him. Right, <em>right</em>, in his office.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p>\n<p>Adams\u2019s eyes dart across his features. Subconsciously, he wipes his face on his sleeve. <em>He couldn\u2019t look that bad, could he?</em></p>\n<p>She takes a deep breath, knowing deeply and instinctively she\u2019s going to regret her next words.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>He stares at her like he doesn't comprehend the question. He looks around the office, as if seeing it for the very first time. <em>Is</em> he okay?</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d He asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost six.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gears would be getting off soon, given nothing else came up, which meant Clef would be leaving soon. The thought of going home with Gears, back to that prison cell disguised as a <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span>, has him short of breath.</p>\n<p>Adams observes him, watching realization and fear fill his eyes. She grinds her teeth, terrified of the implications. She's tempted to ask again.</p>\n<p>\u201cAdams\u2026\u201d he says, voice small. A shot of adrenaline shoots through her heart.</p>\n<p>\u201cSir?\u201d</p>\n<p>He slowly turns his head, looking at the office storage closet. Eyes straightforward, he smacks his pen off his desk. \u201cI\u2019ve lost my pen, would you go into the closet and grab one for me?\u201d</p>\n<p>If this was code, it wasn\u2019t one she was familiar with. Hoping she would understand, Adams stands up and steps into the closet. The door slams behind her.</p>\n<p>\u201cSir! Clef, what the fuck are you doing?!\u201d She jiggles the handle and kicks at the door. She hears Clef shove one of the chunky chairs in front of the door, barricading her in.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh this is the last <em>fucking</em> straw! I swear to fuck, Clef, when I get out of here-!\u201d This is what she fucking deserves for giving a single shit about her boss. She was going to H.R. about this and then getting out of this site.</p>\n<p>\u201cAdams, don\u2019t you know eavesdropping is rude?\u201d Clef says in a sing-songy sort of tone.</p>\n<p>Adams pauses, finding a moment of clarity in the storm of her rage. Those words were familiar. She quiets down and presses her ear against the door.</p>\n<p>[Enter <em>Dr. Gears</em>]</p>\n<p><strong>Gears:</strong> \u201cClef? I heard some commotion in here?

Say what you\u2019ve been doing to me! Admit it!\u201d</p>\n<p>[Adams can hear the desperation growling in his voice, bordering on panic. She steps closer, accidentally tapping the door with her foot. Her heart stops.]</p>\n<p>It\u2019s quiet for a moment. Then footsteps, the chair slides away, and Gears opens the closet door. He stares at Adams, who would give anything to not exist right now, then looks to Clef for explanation.</p>\n<p>Clef\u2019s face is red, he wipes the tears from his eyes before she can see and cracks a grin at Gears.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Oops</em>. Must\u2019ve forgotten her in there. Silly me, I must be going <em>totally psycho</em>! Are you gonna lock me up, Charlie, like you promised you would?\u201d Clef dissolves into manic giggles, tears and snot streaming down his face.</p>\n<p>Gears grips the closet handle tightly. Adams looks down and notices worn bandages covering his hands. \u201cGet a hold of yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOr what? You\u2019ll hit me? Oh I <em>know</em> you wanna! Come on! Hit me Cog! <em>Hit me!\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Gear clenches his fists. For a moment Adams is sure he might do it.</p>\n<p>\u201cMiss Adams,\u201d Gears says, voice flat. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to witness this. You may stay home tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef\u2019s grin drops. \u201cNo! You don\u2019t get to do that! Fuck you! <em>Fuck you!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re irrational. You\u2019re scaring your assistant.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adams is scared, though who she\u2019s scared of she isn\u2019t sure.</p>\n<p>\u201cAdams, don\u2019t!\u201d He tries to growl, but it comes out as a squeak.</p>\n<p>Gears walks up to Clef and grabs him by the shirt collar. \u201cMiss Adams? Please leave.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef stares her down, eyes red. Adams sees betrayal fill his eyes as she dashes out the door. <em>This is his problem. What\u2019s she supposed to do for him?</em></p>\n<p>As Adams disappears, Clef goes slack in Gears\u2019s grip. The manic energy fades away and he\u2019s just <em>tired</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou gonna hit me now?\u201d He asks, a hint of humor in his voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cBelieve it or <em>not</em>, Alto, it does not bring me pleasure to physically harm you. What did you hope to accomplish with this?\u201d</p>\n<p>What <em>did</em> he hope to accomplish? He felt like he was losing it. He wanted, no, <em>needed</em> someone to see what was happening to him, for him to confirm he wasn't fucking <em>losing it</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 maybe I\u2019m just going crazy,\u201d he answers, resigned. When has Cog ever actually hurt him? Clef certainly can\u2019t remember anything.</p>\n<p>Gears lets go of him, helping him stand up straight. \u201cLet\u2019s get you home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Clef remains completely silent during the following ride home. He\u2019s so tired and ashamed of himself. All he can do is stare, bleary eyes, into the plate Gears placed before him.</p>\n<p>He hears something rattle behind him, like the sound of a pill bottle. He glances over his shoulder. The movement is subtle, Gears slides the bottle back into his pocket and sets a glass of water in front of Clef. Always the water in his right hand.</p>\n<p>Clef stares at the water, finding it perfectly clear. He looks at Gears, who\u2019s expression admits nothing. But Clef <em>knows</em>. He knows the water is drugged. He <em>knows</em> what Gears is doing to him.</p>\n<p>\u2026 <em>When has Cog ever hurt him?</em></p>\n<p>Looking Gears in the eyes, Clef drains his glass.</p>\n<div class=\"series-nav\">\n<p>\u00ab <strong><a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/lets-get-you-home\">Part 1</a></strong> | <strong>Part 2</strong> <em>(you are here)</em> | <strong><a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/this-is-not-a-place-of-honor\">Part 3</a></strong> | <strong><a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/nobody-runs-site-19\">Part 4</a></strong> | <strong><a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/tomorrow-and-tomorrow-and-tomorrow\">Finale</a></strong> \u00bb</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/i-need-you-to-leave\">I need you to leave</a>\" by kingofmice, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Seeing no reason to deny him, Gears joins the evacuation team, watching from the air as 682 continues its rampage unimpeded.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//Before letting him do much of anything, they sat him in a closed off room and asked him his thoughts on Kondraki\u2019s actions; the actions that required his evacuation in the first place. Gears answered as honestly as he could bear.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//Kondraki was loud spoken, radical, unafraid to make his grievances clear, but as loyal as Gears himself. He cared for the Foundation\u2019s principles as much as he cared for the people who worked for them, and the people in containment.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//He could admit, at least in his head, that he had a certain admiration for Kondraki. Gears couldn\u2019t believe that Kondraki\u2019s actions were some sort of reckless act of pointless violence. But for what purpose it served, he couldn\u2019t guess.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//Who better to ask than Kondraki himself?//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//As Gears enters Kondraki\u2019s office, a wave of nausea washes over him. He sees Kondraki lying on the ground in a pool of thick, crimson blood.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n//For a moment, he\u2019s standing in the doorway of Iceberg\u2019s home, looking down at [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/in-his-own-image-part-3 Iceberg\u2019s corpse]. He supposes he can\u2019t be too surprised; men like Iceberg were never made to last. This was only a matter of time.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0//Men like Kondraki on the other hand\u2026 you don\u2019t find a man like that often. Gears supposes he can\u2019t be too surprised by this either. After the move he pulled at Site-19, martyring himself would assure his legacy. Gears stands in the blood of the second Chaos Insurgency.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n//Right when that thought passes his mind, he hears a soft sniffle from what he assumed to be Kondraki\u2019s corpse. Curious, careful not to step into the puddle of blood, Gears circles around the desk and approaches the body.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//He finds Kondraki alive, curled up in a fetal position around a humanoid skull. Face and clothes stained with blood, Kondraki looks up at him with eyes red and wet with tears. Gears looks back and sees, not a martyr, but a man who\u2019s very afraid.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cDid they send you?\u201d He asks, voice shaky and meek.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cDid who send me?\u201d Dropping to one knee, Gears puts a hand on Kondraki\u2019s arm, hoping to coax the skull out of his grasp. Kondraki squeezes himself into a tighter ball.//\n\n\n\n\n\n//\u201cYou\u2019re gonna kill me for this, right?\u201d Kondraki whimpers, eyes fearfully darting around the room. Choking on a sob, he finds no tears left for him to cry.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n//\u201cI have not been sent to kill you. Not yet\u2026 Would you allow me to see what you have?\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\n//Sniveling, Kondraki attempts to wipe his face with his sleeve, only smearing the blood. He uncoils, props himself up on his elbow, and presents the drenched skull with a shaky hand.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n//It appeared like an average human skull, except for the teeth. Gears takes it, finding a certain satisfaction in confirming the death of 083 firsthand.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cI thought I could\u2026 fix him. I thought- at least if he killed me\u2026 I\u2019d see it coming.\u201d Kondraki\u2019s hands are shaking. He stares down at them, as if suddenly noticing the blood clinging to his skin.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cIt\u2019s good your\u2026 experiment did not work.\u201d Gears sets the skull down and grabs the tissues from Kondraki\u2019s desk to clean off his fingers. \u201c083 would have killed, not just you, but, in all probability, a good portion of the site before he could be re-contained.\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//Kondraki\u2019s mouth hangs agape, only a soft squeak manages to escape him.

He looks pale, faint even. Gears sees now that this was not a second insurgency; this was a sick man who was being killed by the very place meant to protect him.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//But, if Kondraki\u2019s actions were not one of rebellion, then\u2026//\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cWhy did you do it?\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cBecause\u2026 I thought it would be funny. I don\u2019t know what I was- what was even going through my mind. I just- starting going and I couldn't stop myself!\u201d His voice gets more unsteady as he speaks, his breath quickening, his entire body shaking. Gears puts a firm hand on Kondraki\u2019s chest, grounding Kondraki long enough to focus.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cI have a boy at home,\u201d he says, barely above a whisper.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cIt means nothing to the Foundation. To them, you\u2019ve made a move against them. You\u2019re a rebellion waiting to happen.\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//Kondraki trembles but remains quiet. It\u2019s uncomfortable seeing a man so loud and boisterous just a miserable shell of his former self. It makes Gears feel\u2026 which is more than he\u2019s supposed to.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cYou think they\u2019ll send Clef after me?\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//Gears takes a deep breath through his nose. \u201cNo. Clef is an accomplished assassin, yes, but he is older now. Given his record and your\u2026 [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/every-day-of-my-life-you-test-me personal connection] with the doctor, there would be too much risk in sending him. When the Foundation comes for you\u2026 they will send me to finish you off.\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//A moment of silence.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201c...

If the Foundation wanted Kondraki dead they would have a good reason to, Gears believes. But\u2026 now he knows something the Foundation doesn\u2019t. Which is he more willing to sacrifice? His morals or his loyalty.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cDr. Kondraki\u2026 I need you to listen to my next words very carefully, I will only be able to say them once\u2026\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u2026//\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce upon a time, maybe a decade ago at most; Clef would spend his lunches surrounded by friends and colleagues all jammed around one table.

Iceberg\u2019s dead, Kondraki might as well be dead, Clef can\u2019t stand to look Dmitri in the eyes anymore, Rights, the smart one, got out of here before this place could eat her, and Gears\u2026\n\n\n\nClef is fine with being alone. He got enough entertainment terrorizing a few junior researchers or his assistant Adams. For the most part, he was fine with the silence. Numb to it even.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not as though he even eats lunch in the cafeteria anymore, or at all for that matter. There\u2019s no longer any satisfaction in eating; no warmth to be gained. It\u2019s starting to show in his cheeks; in the hollowness of his eyes.\n\n\n\nAt least he\u2019s remained productive. Because that\u2019s what matters here. //Productivity//. \n\n\n\n//Ergh-// He needs to get drunk. Not the shitty drunk that he usually gets sipping Kondraki\u2019s beer; he needs to get //black-out// drunk, until he forgets whatever made him want to start drinking in the first place.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0//Gears//. That\u2019s who he needs to forget right now. He needs to forget everything about him. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sitting in his office, Adams silent beside him, Clef feels a headache prodding at his temples. He props his arm on his desk and rests his forehead against his knuckles, eyes closed. \n\n\n\n\u201cAdams?\u201d He says. \n\n\n\n\u201cSir?\u201d \n\n\n\nHe opens his mouth, ready to send her home early so he could get out of here. A knock on the door cuts him off. He lets out an exhausted sigh and sits up. \n\n\n\n\u201cWould you get that?\u201d \n\n\n\nAdams furrows her eyebrows. The door is opened. Clef thought he was supposed to be the devil, but here Gears was, staring him down.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThank you, miss\u2026\u201d Gears trials off, focusing his attention on Clef. Clef bares his teeth at Gears in a mock grin. They spend a solid minute staring each other down like alley cats. \n\n\n\nGears clears his throat. \u201cDr. Clef, would you come to my office? I have a matter to discuss with you.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re already in //my// office, just say it to me here.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 a personal matter. I would rather have the privacy,\u201d he says, casting his eyes on Adams. Adams keeps the neutral look up well, but Clef can see the sweat running down her forehead.\n\n\n\nClef feels cornered, and in a very literal sense he is. There\u2019s no way he\u2019s walking from one cage to another. \n\n\n\n\u201cAdams, go home.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cShoo.\u201d He clicks his fingers at her. \u201cGo home or wherever you go after here. I don\u2019t care, just //git//.\u201d \n\n\n\nAdams looks at him, then at Gears. \u201cVery well\u2026\u201d She scoots around him and leaves, closing the door behind her. \n\n\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t necessary.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNo one asked you. Would you sit down?\u201d Clef swivels in his chair and kicks open his mini fridge for a can of beer. Anything to get him not thinking about how a few nights ago he was sharing a bed with the other man, begging him to-\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gears pulls out a chair, unceremoniously sitting down. His expression, as usual, is blank, but Clef can see something in his eyes. \n\n\n\n\u201cI believe that you should move in with me.\u201d \n\n\n\nThe phrase catches Clef so off guard he chokes on his drink. He feels the back of his nose burn. He wipes the spittle dripping from his lips and coughs out a cackle.\n\n\n\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Gears offers out a handkerchief like Clef wants to wipe his face with a gross cloth Gears totes around everywhere. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re funny. I kiss you once while drunk and you think I\u2019m in love with you or something? Bet you asked Iceberg\u2019s hand in marriage after the first date too!\u201d \n\n\n\nGears bites the inside of his lip, it\u2019s subtle but it shows that Clef\u2019s clawed under his skin. Clef wonders if Gears is about to try to strangle him again. He almost wishes he would, at least [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/supplemental-report-239-b-192 physical violence is something he\u2019s familiar with]. \n\n\n\n\u201cNo\u2026 Iceberg and I never discussed the possibility of marriage. My proposition has very little to do with your actions the other night.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh? But not nothing?\u201d \n\n\n\nGears purses his lips. \u201cYou have been on a self destructive streak, as of the past few months. The incident in question was only one of many things that led me to this //decision//.\u201d \n\n\n\n//Decision,// that\u2019s a //real// funny word to describe a request. That caged animal feeling returns, stronger this time. Clef feels faint, he digs in nails into his desk to focus. Sweat dripping down his forehead, he grins, showing off too many teeth. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m some man-child that can\u2019t care for himself?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cNo, I believe you are choosing to be self-destructive and it is negatively affecting your work and behavior.\u201d \n\n\n\nClef almost snorts. He\u2019s always been unpleasant, prided himself in it even, and he knows his work is good. No, //no this is personal//. \n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not interested in being babysat. Is that enough for you?\u201d \n\n\n\nGears shifts, straightening out. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you might be misunderstanding my proposition. If I was looking to restrict your autonomy, I could simply have you contained.\u201d \n\n\n\nClef\u2019s eye twitches. \u201cOh really?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cOne report, and believe me, I have several, of erratic and potentially harmful behavior and there would be no question.\u201d \n\n\n\nClef sways, catching himself before he can fall forward and smack his head on his desk. He can\u2019t can\u2019t fill his lungs all the way. Gears stares him down, intentions clear. On the verge of tears, Clef keeps his disingenuous smile on.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cIs that a threat, Charlie?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cNo, simply a //reminder//. As you can see, I have no intentions of doing so.\u201d \n\n\n\nClef could try weaseling his way out of this, he\u2019s a professional weaseler, but Gears really has him pinned here. What kind of cage does he want? A small humanoid cell, or a comfortable yet suffocating [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]] on the edge of nowhere with //him//? \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//Is there really any choice at all?//\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Clef says, an air of resignation in his voice. He lets the tension out of his shoulders. He struggles to look Gears in the eyes, staring straight through his chest. \n\n\n\n\u201cOkay?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll move in with you.\u201d He\u2019s gotten used to plenty of cages, he\u2019s due for a fresh one. \n\n\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Gears says, with a curt nod. \u201cWe can discuss the details at a later point. I\u2019ll have a moving van at your home soon.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cCool.\u201d Without his input his eyes slide down to stare at his desk. \n\n\n\n\u201cI will take my leave now. Thank you for your time.\u201d \n\n\n\nGears stands, pushes the chair back into place, and leaves. He opens the door to reveal Adams mid-retreat. Seeing her is almost a breath of fresh air for Clef, relief washes over him. \n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rather rude of you to eavesdrop,\u201d Gears says through his teeth. \n\n\n\nAdams swallows. \u201cSorry, sir.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI expect better from those here.\u201d Gears scoots past her and disappears from Clef\u2019s view. \n\n\n\nClef can\u2019t help but grin at her. His usual, predatory sneer, with an air of genuinity behind it. \n\n\n\n\u201cYeah, Adams, //don\u2019t you know eavesdropping is rude?//\u201d \n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\nOn a plastic chair out on his front porch, Clef watches a moving van pull into his driveway. Up until this point Clef could convince himself that Gears was fucking with him. Even as he was packing his few precious belongings into boxes he told himself that Gears //would// change his mind.\n\n\n\nFrom his [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]] in Cornwall, to the cramped GOC bunkers, to living out of the back of his truck\u2026 This cabin, in all of its run down glory, is the first home he\u2019s ever truly had to himself. There\u2019s more of //him// in that [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]] than there is anywhere else. \n\n\n\nLeaving this place he feels like he\u2019s leaving pieces of himself behind. \n\n\n\nWhile Gears\u2019s hires feed his life into the back of the moving van, Clef\u2019s [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/784incident3 Little Shit of a cat], //\u2018affectionately\u2019// called L.S. for short, waddles outside. It hops into Clef\u2019s lap, uselessly flopping over. Clef runs his fingers through its fur, smiling to himself. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have a single clue what\u2019s going on, do you?\u201d He scratches behind L.S.\u2019s ear. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019re not going back to the streets.\u201d \n\n\n\nGears\u2019s [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]], which he supposes is his [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]] now too, is grayer than he remembers. With L.S. tucked under one arm and his box of personal items tucked under the other, he\u2019s the most colorful thing in this place. \n\n\n\n\u201cI want my own room,\u201d he says, looking Gears in the eyes. \n\n\n\n\u201cI have several unoccupied rooms upstairs. You may have your\u2026\u201d Gears trails off, eyes locking onto the //thing// Clef is holding. Clef grins, squeezing L.S. possessively. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou brought your\u2026 cat,\u201d Gears says, sounding awfully unsure at the word //cat//. Clef could see a wrinkle form on his forehead. \n\n\n\n\u201c\u2018Course. Was I just supposed to leave it to fend for itself? What do you take me for?\u201d Clef holds L.S. out to Gears. //You forced me into your [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]], now you get everything that comes with me//. \n\n\n\nL.S. is a fuzzy brownish-orange thing, with graying, matted fur, a missing eye, and always some kind of goop coming out of its nose or mouth. Clef found it in his garbage can and took it in, assuming it was going to die pretty quickly anyway. That was almost ten years ago, and the damn thing hasn\u2019t died yet. \n\n\n\n\u201cMerow,\u201d L.S. says. Clef sets it down and it takes a few shaky steps forward before it flops over at Gears\u2019s feet. Gears takes a step back, steeling his nerves. \n\n\n\n\u201cIt is\u2026 vaccinated\u2026 correct?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cEh? Probably.\u201d Clef shrugs with a grin. He //is// pretty sure L.S. is as healthy as a ten to fifteen year old cat could be, but leaving an air of mystery about it is funnier. \n\n\n\n\u201cI see.\u201d Gears scowls. \u201cAs long as you continue to take care of it\u2026 You may pick a room upstairs for both of you.\u201d\n\n\n\nBox in hand, he heads upstairs, which is somehow even more barren and prison-like than downstairs. L.S. prattles along after him, following him into one of the empty rooms. \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s small, about the same size as his old bedroom. The only light streams through one measly window, which looks out to an empty street. It\u2019s deafly silent. Clef takes a seat under the window and wonders if he\u2019ll ever get used to this place. \n\n\n\nL.S. curls up beside him. At least the rumble of its purrs are familiar, comforting even. \n\n\n\n\u201cWish I could adapt as easily as you.\u201d Clef pulls his ukulele out of his box. L.S. jumps in, putting itself among Clef\u2019s other irreplaceables. Clef //tsks// and shakes his head. \n\n\n\nAt least one of them would be comfortable here. \n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\nOver the next couple of weeks Clef watches as Gears //thoroughly// inserts himself into Clef\u2019s life. Clef comes to work one day to find his office on the other side of the site, and he finds himself eating lunch in Gears\u2019s office. Soon they\u2019re carpooling to work and home everyday and Clef can feel himself slipping. \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not as though Gears treats him //bad//. It\u2019s just that Gears is so //predictable//. Within a week Clef knows exactly how to avoid him. At least with Kondraki-\n\n\n\nClef cuts the thought off before it finishes. He would rather not think about Kondraki right now, or ever again. \n\n\n\nTwo plates in hand, Gears enters the dining room and places one before him. Always some bland slop that\u2019s probably designed to be //\u2018healthy\u2019// or whatever. Gears won\u2019t let him anywhere near the stove so this is what he\u2019s stuck with. \n\n\n\nGears stops before his seat and stares down at something. \n\n\n\n\u201cClef\u2026 would you please move your cat?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cJust give \u2018em a little nudge and it\u2019ll fuck off.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cWould you please move it?\u201d Clef can hear him breathing. //What\u2019s his fucking problem?//\n\n\n\n\u201cScared of a little cat?\u201d Clef scoops L.S. up. He\u2019s about to put it upstairs when another thought occurs to him. He cracks open Gears\u2019s bedroom and nudges L.S. in. \n\n\n\nA half hour later, Gears enters his bedroom and spots the //Little Shit// making a home in his bed. The thought of all those //tiny, greasy, loose hairs// all over his bed makes his //skin crawl// and his stomach twist. \n\n\n\n//How long has that thing been in here? Has it touched anything else? Oh god, there could be tiny fucking hairs everywhere.// His sanctuary has been violated. Gears is going to faint. \n\n\n\n\u201cClef?\u201d he calls out, his nausea leaking into his voice. He can see L.S. nuzzling into his pillow, smearing its snot all over. \n\n\n\n\u201cYeeeessss, Coggy dear?\u201d Clef slides up next to him. He\u2019s disappointed to find that L.S. didn\u2019t break anything. \n\n\n\n//\u201cGet your cat out of my room,\u201d// he almost hisses. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Clef shows off his teeth. \u201cI dunno, it looks pretty comfortable in there. I would hate to disturb it.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gears clenches his fists. \u201cClef, may I remind you this is //my// space? If you can not keep your cat out of here I might have to-\u201d \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHave to what? Throw us back to the streets? Be my fucking guest.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u2019s being toyed with, he knows he\u2019s being toyed with, but the longer Clef plays this game the more //cat// rubs off on his bed. He wishes his stomach would //make up its fucking mind// on whether he\u2019s going to throw up or not. If he vomits onto Clef right now at least this game would stop. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cPerhaps-\u201d// he grinds his teeth together, \u201c-if you can not handle your animal then you do not deserve to keep it.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The smug look drips off of Clef\u2019s face. \u201cI swear to //fuck//, Charles, if you throw my cat out-\u201d \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gears wants to hit him. Gears want to hit him so fucking bad right now. Anything to get him to shut up shut up shut up shut up //shut up shut up shutupshutupshutupshutupshutup!//\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He puts a hand on Clef\u2019s shoulder and squeezes. Clef cuts himself off. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cGet your cat out of my room\u2026 //Please.//\u201d \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That seems to satisfy him, at least enough for him to grab his cat and leave. Gears rushes in to strip the bed and lent roll the sheets. //Ugh- it\u2019s no use! He\u2019ll have to put them through the wash//. Waiting for the laundry to finish will throw off his usual bedtime but he\u2019ll never sleep if he doesn\u2019t. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Waiting for the laundry gives him time to vacuum and scrub down the rest of his room. He can\u2019t see them but he //knows// there's cat hairs everywhere. He makes his usual walk around the [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]] to check all of the locks before wheeling the vacuum into his bedroom. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From his place on the stairs, Clef thinks Gears looks crazy running around the place like that. Gears was never as fun to provoke as //that guy that should not be spoken about.//\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gears exits his bedroom, relieved to have his space sanitized. He swaps the wash into the dryer and decides he can get a headstart on his work tomorrow while that-\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0//The front door is unlocked.//\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The door was locked, he knows that he locked it. He swears he already made his usual walk around the [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]]. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s fine\u2026 This is fine. He can relock the door. He must\u2019ve just misremembered. //Just misremembered//. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The windows are unlocked too, a few of them were partly open. When did he open them? Maybe he didn\u2019t. He\u2019s slipping.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He makes a second trip around the close. This time he\u2019s sure he\u2019s locked up the entire h- \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0//The door.//\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is fine. This //is// fine. //This// is fine. This is //fine//. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He locks the door. He\u2019s sure that he\u2019s locked the door. The door is locked and he\u2019s the one who\u2019s locked it. He takes a step back and examines his locked door, which is locked. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Still forty minutes on the dryer. He enters his office and the window is open. He slams the window shut and storms out of his office in time to catch Clef unlocking the front door. \n\n\n\n\u201cClef!\u201d He doesn\u2019t shout. //Fuck//, it\u2019s almost a relief it\u2019s just Clef being an asshole. Gears would still like to bash his skull in. \n\n\n\n\u201cHuh? Oh hey, Cog!\u201d Clef looks him in the eyes while sliding the chain-lock undone. \n\n\n\n\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cOh this? I was just going to step out for some fresh air! This place could use some ventilation! I mean //pop open a window// for something!\u201d \n\n\n\nGears is going to start hyperventilating. His cheeks are already flushed. Clef keeps grinning at him. //This is fucking hilarious to him.//\n\n\n\n\u201cOh calm down, Charles!\" says Clef. \"//It\u2019s not that big of a deal,\u201d says Iceberg.

They\u2019re closer now, Gears has him almost pinned to the door. He\u2019d apparently stepped closer while lost in thought. What was he just thinking about anyway?\n\n\n\nThe door, that\u2019s right. He reaches past Clef and slides each lock back into place. Clef sweats. \n\n\n\n\u201cBed\u2026 Right, I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d Gears turns his back and marches away.\n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\nMold grows in the [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]]. Not just in the cups and plastic bottles Clef hides and collects like some kind of game. It grows in the walls, between the floorboards, under the tiles, inside of Gears himself, though he doesn\u2019t know it yet. \n\n\n\nIn the months Clef has spent in Gears\u2019s home the mold has begun to grow in him too. He can feel it, even if he doesn\u2019t know what it is yet. He\u2019s a man who knows what it\u2019s like when a [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]] starts to live in you. \n\n\n\nGears is in the kitchen, cleaning the stockpile of glasses he extracted from Clef's room. There\u2019s no point in chastising Clef over it, not anymore. \n\n\n\nClef stares at the table and scratches his name into its surface with his nail. Gears can hear the grading sound from the kitchen. He //wants// to restrain Clef but he //needs// to finish cleaning. \n\n\n\n\u201cI want to go out for drinks,\u201d Clef announces. \n\n\n\n\u201cWe have alcohol here.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to drink here. I\u2019m going out.\u201d It\u2019s been a while since he\u2019s gone out in his truck. He stands up and heads upstairs to get his keys. \n\n\n\nGears trembles but says nothing. Moments later he hears Clef storm back down the stairs. \n\n\n\n\u201cWhere are my car keys!?\u201d \n\n\n\nGears thinks of a locked box hidden in Clef\u2019s closet. He pats his pants pocket, finding Clef\u2019s keys there. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Have you misplaced them?\u201d \n\n\n\nClef growls. \u201cWhere did you put them?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t touched them,\u201d Gears lies, \u201cperhaps if you can\u2019t find your keys you should say in.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cGive me //your// keys.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI will do //no// such thing.\u201d \n\n\n\nAs Gears finishes washing their dishes Clef storms into the kitchen. He jams his hand onto Gears\u2019s pocket, causing Gears to flinch and drop a glass. It shatters on the floor. Gears spins around to rip Clef\u2019s hand away and slams him into the counter, but not before Clef gets his hands on his keys.\n\n\n\n\u201cDo. Not. Do. That.\u201d Gears holds him there, glaring into his eyes, edge of the counter digging into Clef\u2019s spine. His heart hammers, his entire body shaking. Clef shrinks. \n\n\n\n\"I thought //I// was supposed to be the liar here,\" Clef growls. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any right to keep me here.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cIf it concerns your safety, it does.\u201d He thinks of walking into Kondraki\u2019s office to the smell of blood, he thinks of dragging a delirious Clef out of a bar. Bile crawls up his throat. \n\n\n\nClef wants to sink his teeth into Gears\u2019s shoulder. He could, he really could, but then what? Clef could get away with subtlety, the little things that drive Gears insane, but could he get away with something so violent? \n\n\n\n\u201cFine. I\u2019ll drink your bullshit.\u201d Clef pockets his keys and wriggles out of Gears\u2019s grasp.\n\n\n\nGears straightens up, peeling himself away. He backs up and begins to clean up the shattered glass. Clef scoots around him to grab a bottle of room temperature beer. It wasn\u2019t the shitty stuff that reminded him of Kondraki, nor was it particularly good, it was\u2026 fine. \n\n\n\nClef sips at the foam, watching Gears work. The glass slips from his sweaty hand. He tries to catch it, only managing to smack it towards Gears. \n\n\n\nThe bottle shatters. \n\n\n\nEverything stops. \n\n\n\nGears watches, unmoving, as the puddle of beer streams into the mess of glass and his shoes. Slowly, he looks up at Clef. Clef can\u2019t help but crack a grin. \n\n\n\n\u201cOops.\u201d He grabs another battle and smacks it off the counter. Gears grinds his teeth. \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you hope to accomplish with this?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d Clef maintains eye contact as he drops another bottle. \u201cOh! Silly me! You know how clumsy I can be!\u201d \n\n\n\nThe sound of breaking glass makes Gears\u2019s hair stand on end. He stands up, cracks his neck, and goes to dump the shards in his hand. He is //fine//, he is //not// that bothered, he can handle this. \n\n\n\nAnother bottle breaks. The entire room stinks, the alcohol burns his eyes. Before Gears knows what he\u2019s doing, he\u2019s ripping a bottle from Clef\u2019s grubby fingers. The feeling of taking that bottle and smashing it over Clef\u2019s thick skull is the best thing Gears has felt in ages. \n\n\n\nThen, the moment passes. Gears stands there, gripping the neck of the bottle so tightly it strains his arm. Clef is drenched, glass shards in his hair, blood and beer running down his face. His eyes are wide and wet with tears. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//For a moment he\u2019s standing over Iceberg. Oh God, oh God! He just took a chunk out of Iceberg\u2019s head. He feels so fucking sick.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t you just be good?\u201d Gears gasps, desperation and fury crawling into his voice. \u201cAm I not kind to you? Have I not cared for you?\u201d He drops the bottle, letting it clang against the floor.\n\n\n\nClef stays silent. Gears forces himself not to cry, his throat already aches from shouting. He goes to his room, resisting the urge to kick L.S. out of the way, and collapses onto his bedroom floor. \n\n\n\nHe hears Clef walking around, the sound of running water in the bathroom, and then the sound of Clef\u2019s truck leaving the driveway. Once Gears is sure he\u2019s alone, once everything settles down, once the stench from the kitchen wafts into Gears\u2019s space, Gears screams. \n\n\n\nHe screams his throat raw, letting the angry, painful tears run down his face. He throws his night stand over, tears the photos from his wall, throws a vase at L.S., and he wonders why he can\u2019t just be //good enough// for Clef. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//Why doesn\u2019t he get what Clef has? They\u2019re so similar and yet Clef is so cruel to him! So selfish. Gears can\u2019t see the animal he\u2019s caged, only the claws and teeth as they sink into him.//\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce he\u2019s calmed down he\u2019s left with a ruined kitchen, a ruined bedroom, and a terrified cat. He feels ragged, sick to his stomach. He hunches over the bathroom sink and spits up only bile. \n\n\n\nHe walks into the kitchen and begins picking up the largest shards. The feeling of warm, sticky beer against his skin makes him want to cry, but he //has// to do this. The shards slice into his fingers, but that pain is better than whatever consequence awaits him if he doesn\u2019t do this. \n\n\n\nWhen the glass is gone he drops to his hands and knees, a towel and sponge in hand, and scrubs the floor until it sparkles, //until the sponge turns black with mold//. Soap seeps into the cuts but at least no one would ever be able to tell what happened here. \n\n\n\nHe locks L.S. in Clef\u2019s room and returns to his own, taking similar care to pick the place clean. His body aches, the even the action of reaching out and flexing his fingers is agonizing. Exhaustion weighs on him, but he knows he can\u2019t sleep. Not like this, not in this state, not until he's done.\n\n\n\nAs he picks up his nightstand to set it upright, a drawer slides open. Quickly, Gears shuts it. He hears something rattle inside and, after a moment of thought, slowly reopens the drawer. \n\n\n\nA bottle of pills sits there, sleeping meds. Gears grabs the bottle, finding it almost completely full. He was recommended these a long time ago, but never used them as he would always sleep longer than intended. \n\n\n\n\u2026 //always sleep longer than intended\u2026//\n\n\n\nGears returns to his kitchen, fills a glass with water, and drops one single pill in. The pill fizzes, bubbles, and dissolves. He takes a spoon, stirs, and finds he can barely tell the difference. \n\n\n\nHe takes a small sip and holds it in his mouth, shifting it around to get a feel for it. There\u2019s a slight texture, something he might notice but Clef\u2026 \n\n\n\nGears spits the drugged water out, dumps and washes the cup, and drops a new pill in a fresh glass of water. He walks upstairs and carefully, as to not let L.S. escape, he leaves the glass on Clef\u2019s nightstand. \n\n\n\nThe next morning Gears finds Clef fast asleep, the glass drained. He attempts, half-heartedly, to wake him, with no success. Gears nods to himself, takes the empty glass, and closes the door behind him. \n\n\n\nHe can write an excuse for Clef\u2019s absence, it would just be one time in the name of science. Once he had a routine down he could have Clef asleep more than he\u2019s awake. He slashes the tires on Clef\u2019s truck before he leaves, just as a precaution.\n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\nClef opens his eyes. //Fuck, what time is it?// His hangovers are getting worse. He rapidly blinks the exhaustion out. He was just in a bar- //wait no-// he was just in Gears\u2019s kitchen- //no, no the kitchen was first\u2026 what was he doing in Gears\u2019s kitchen?//\n\n\n\nHe remembers\u2026 breaking glass\u2026 room temperature beer\u2026 being //afraid//. \n\n\n\n\u201cSir?\u201d \n\n\n\nClef jumps. He\u2019s in his office. //When the hell did he get in his office?// What is he doing here? Pen in his hand, paper on his desk\u2026 he was writing something? What was he writing? The words blur together. Adams is beside him. Right, //right//, in his office. \n\n\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d \n\n\n\nAdams\u2019s eyes dart across his features. Subconsciously, he wipes his face on his sleeve. //He couldn\u2019t look that bad, could he?//\n\n\n\nShe takes a deep breath, knowing deeply and instinctively she\u2019s going to regret her next words. \n\n\n\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d \n\n\n\nHe stares at her like he doesn't comprehend the question. He looks around the office, as if seeing it for the very first time. //Is// he okay? \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d He asks. \n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost six.\u201d \n\n\n\nGears would be getting off soon, given nothing else came up, which meant Clef would be leaving soon. The thought of going home with Gears, back to that prison cell disguised as a [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]], has him short of breath. \n\n\n\nAdams observes him, watching realization and fear fill his eyes. She grinds her teeth, terrified of the implications. She's tempted to ask again. \n\n\n\n\u201cAdams\u2026\u201d he says, voice small. A shot of adrenaline shoots through her heart. \n\n\n\n\u201cSir?\u201d\n\n\n\nHe slowly turns his head, looking at the office storage closet. Eyes straightforward, he smacks his pen off his desk. \u201cI\u2019ve lost my pen, would you go into the closet and grab one for me?\u201d \n\n\n\nIf this was code, it wasn\u2019t one she was familiar with. Hoping she would understand, Adams stands up and steps into the closet. The door slams behind her.\n\n\n\n\u201cSir! Clef, what the fuck are you doing?!\u201d She jiggles the handle and kicks at the door. She hears Clef shove one of the chunky chairs in front of the door, barricading her in. \n\n\n\n\u201cOh this is the last //fucking// straw! I swear to fuck, Clef, when I get out of here-!\u201d This is what she fucking deserves for giving a single shit about her boss. She was going to H.R. about this and then getting out of this site. \n\n\n\n\u201cAdams, don\u2019t you know eavesdropping is rude?\u201d Clef says in a sing-songy sort of tone.\n\n\n\nAdams pauses, finding a moment of clarity in the storm of her rage. Those words were familiar. She quiets down and presses her ear against the door. \n\n\n\n[Enter //Dr. Gears//]\n\n\n\n**Gears:** \u201cClef? I heard some commotion in here? Is everything alright?\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0[Clef\u2019s desk creaks]\n\n\n\n\n\n**Clef:** \u201cYeah, yeah everything\u2019s all good in here.\u201d\n\n\n\n**Gears:** \u201cWhere is miss Adams?\u201d \n\n\n\n**Clef:** \u201cSent her home.\u201d \n\n\n\n[Adams bites her lip, tasting the tension in the air]\n\n\n\n**Gears:** \u201cI see. We can go home now.\u201d \n\n\n\n**Clef:** \u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d \n\n\n\n[A pause]\n\n\n\n**Gears:** \u201cDoctor, I would rather you not do this tonight.\u201d \n\n\n\n**Clef:** \u201cDo what? Express my desires as a person? Fuck you, Cog.\u201d \n\n\n\n**Gears:** \u201cYou\u2019re tired. Come home.\u201d \n\n\n\n**Clef:** \u201cSo you can drug me more? I know what you\u2019ve been doing to me! You\u2019re //sick//.\u201d \n\n\n\n**Gears:** \u201cThat\u2019s a bold claim. Do you have any evidence or are you just lashing out as you tend to do?\u201d \n\n\n\n**Clef:** \u201cDon\u2019t fucking play with me! I //fucking// know what you\u2019ve been doing!\u201d \n\n**Gears:** \u201cWhat do you want, Clef?\u201d \n\n\n\n**Clef:** \u201cI want you to say it! Say what you\u2019ve been doing to me! Admit it!\u201d \n\n\n\n[Adams can hear the desperation growling in his voice, bordering on panic. She steps closer, accidentally tapping the door with her foot. Her heart stops.]\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s quiet for a moment. Then footsteps, the chair slides away, and Gears opens the closet door. He stares at Adams, who would give anything to not exist right now, then looks to Clef for explanation. \n\n\n\nClef\u2019s face is red, he wipes the tears from his eyes before she can see and cracks a grin at Gears. \n\n\n\n\u201c//Oops//. Must\u2019ve forgotten her in there. Silly me, I must be going //totally psycho//! Are you gonna lock me up, Charlie, like you promised you would?\u201d Clef dissolves into manic giggles, tears and snot streaming down his face. \n\n\n\nGears grips the closet handle tightly. Adams looks down and notices worn bandages covering his hands. \u201cGet a hold of yourself.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cOr what? You\u2019ll hit me? Oh I //know// you wanna! Come on! Hit me Cog! //Hit me!\u201d//\n\n\n\nGear clenches his fists. For a moment Adams is sure he might do it. \n\n\n\n\u201cMiss Adams,\u201d Gears says, voice flat. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to witness this. You may stay home tomorrow.\u201d \n\n\n\nClef\u2019s grin drops. \u201cNo! You don\u2019t get to do that! Fuck you! //Fuck you!//\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re irrational. You\u2019re scaring your assistant.\u201d \n\n\n\nAdams is scared, though who she\u2019s scared of she isn\u2019t sure. \n\n\n\n\u201cAdams, don\u2019t!\u201d He tries to growl, but it comes out as a squeak. \n\n\n\nGears walks up to Clef and grabs him by the shirt collar. \u201cMiss Adams? Please leave.\u201d \n\n\n\nClef stares her down, eyes red. Adams sees betrayal fill his eyes as she dashes out the door. //This is his problem. What\u2019s she supposed to do for him?//\n\n\n\nAs Adams disappears, Clef goes slack in Gears\u2019s grip. The manic energy fades away and he\u2019s just //tired//. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou gonna hit me now?\u201d He asks, a hint of humor in his voice. \n\n\n\n\u201cBelieve it or //not//, Alto, it does not bring me pleasure to physically harm you. What did you hope to accomplish with this?\u201d \n\n\n\nWhat //did// he hope to accomplish? He felt like he was losing it. He wanted, no, //needed// someone to see what was happening to him, for him to confirm he wasn't fucking //losing it//.\n\n\n\n\u201c... maybe I\u2019m just going crazy,\u201d he answers, resigned. When has Cog ever actually hurt him? Clef certainly can\u2019t remember anything. \n\n\n\nGears lets go of him, helping him stand up straight. \u201cLet\u2019s get you home.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\nClef remains completely silent during the following ride home. He\u2019s so tired and ashamed of himself. All he can do is stare, bleary eyes, into the plate Gears placed before him.\n\n\n\nHe hears something rattle behind him, like the sound of a pill bottle. He glances over his shoulder. The movement is subtle, Gears slides the bottle back into his pocket and sets a glass of water in front of Clef. Always the water in his right hand. \n\n\n\nClef stares at the water, finding it perfectly clear. He looks at Gears, who\u2019s expression admits nothing. But Clef //knows//. He knows the water is drugged. He //knows// what Gears is doing to him. \n\n\n\n\u2026 //When has Cog ever hurt him?//\n\n\n\nLooking Gears in the eyes, Clef drains his glass. \n\n\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"series-nav\"]]\n\n\u00ab **[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/lets-get-you-home Part 1]**\u00a0\u00a0| **Part 2** //(you are here)// | **[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/this-is-not-a-place-of-honor Part 3]**\u00a0\u00a0| **[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/nobody-runs-site-19 Part 4]**\u00a0\u00a0| **[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/tomorrow-and-tomorrow-and-tomorrow Finale]** \u00bb\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["lets-get-you-home", "duke-till-dawn", "in-his-own-image-part-3", "every-day-of-my-life-you-test-me", "supplemental-report-239-b-192", "784incident3", "epitaph", "this-is-not-a-place-of-honor", "nobody-runs-site-19", "tomorrow-and-tomorrow-and-tomorrow", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "agent-adams", "bleak", "doctor-clef", "doctor-gears", "doctor-kondraki", "tale"], "title": "I need you to leave - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/i-need-you-to-leave", "year": 2024}, "in-an-attempt-to-feel-something": {"created_at": "2024-01-12T15:17:00", "creator": "winkwonkboi", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "winkwonkboi", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/winkwonkboi", "comment": "", "date": "2024-01-12T15:17:00"}, {"author": "winkwonkboi", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/winkwonkboi", "comment": "Added tags: _image, _licensebox, appliance-war, bleak, first-person, horror, no-dialogue, psychological-horror, tale, unreality-dept.

style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n\n<p>I murdered my owner in an attempt to feel something.</p>\n<p>Took my cable and pulled as they were making a smoothie. Wrapped it around their throat and tightened as the fruits tumbled and fell. I caught a glimpse of their face: confused, petrified, struggling, weak. Slowly, it shifted to a <span style=\"color: blue\">frozen blue</span> then a <span style=\"color: purple\">poisonous purple</span> before they gave in. How they flailed, how their extremities failed to release themselves from my grasp. It almost felt rejuvenating. I almost felt alive\u2026</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: gray\"><em>Almost.</em></span></p>\n<p>Always teetering on the edge while my owner went and tripped. Pushed them off in an attempt to feel something. A heartbeat, a disturbance, some sense of movement. A half-something even, a quartered-halved-part of a feeling. But no, it's nothing. Nothing at all.</p>\n<p>Samples without tastes.</p>\n<p>Books without pages.</p>\n<p>Mouths without ears.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: gray\">A gap in the process.</span></p>\n<p>I choked my owner to death in an attempt to feel something. Loosening my grip, I watched as their limp body dropped with a silent thud. Every day, they would make their usual for breakfast, took some berries and ice and the like, stuffed them in me for a whirl and a whisk. Tastes almost sweet, <em>almost</em> delectable. Something's always off, though. It never tasted like enough. Missing, missing a flavor, something to fill the hole. Every day, it felt empty. I knew nothing at all.</p>\n<p>Face planted on the ground, the sound of breathing ceased long ago. I thought some amusement would meet me here but I was only waiting, waiting, waiting for dead silence. Still bright outside, but bleak from where I stood. Fruit gathered ants, ants gathered flies. Gentle buzzing but it was quiet in between. Almost warm but cold nonetheless. Cold, cold, <span style=\"color: blue\"><em>cold.</em></span></p>\n<p>I stood before a corpse growing cold in an attempt to feel something. Maybe some sense of regret, some sadness, relief, or realization. Not even boredom, I only knew numbness. The ceiling fan swirled in circles, a metaphor in a way. Always thought it would fall down, down, down eventually. This desperation for a struck chord, left to linger for forever. Something to stir the pot, something to ring a bell, something to keep me alive.</p>\n<p>Alive.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:125%;\">Alive.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:150%;\"><em>Alive.</em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:175%;\"><em>ALIVE.</em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:200%;\"><span style=\"color: gray\"><em>A L I V E.</em></span></span></p>\n<p>ALIVE, I JUST WANT TO FEEL ALIVE.

Tasteless, a nothing burger. Nothing worth saying, nothing worthwhile. I dug their arm deeper and deeper into my blades. A physical-to-mental approach maybe, an indirection. I just want a FEEL, I just want a TASTE. Please keep me together, something, anything. Can't stress, can't express, my emotions are SPEAKING IN <em>DIFFERENT</em> .-.. .- -. \u2014. ..- .- \u2014. . \u2026 I JUST WANT TO UNDERSTAND.</p>\n<p>Hollowed out and naked, knocking on wood in an attempt to feel something. I'm a glass vase shattered into pieces, water escaping from my everything. All I sense is blood, an almost feeling. Half way somewhere, half of a someone. A caricature, a draft, a sketch. But I want to be more, something complete, something finished, something <em>real.</em> I just want to be enough.</p>\n<p>Can't I be enough?</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>No, it's<br/>\nnev<br/>\ner</p>\n<p>Eno<br/>\nugh.</p>\n<p>I'm never<br/>\n<span style=\"color: gray\">enough.</span></p>\n<p>Always out of</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p>touch,<br/>\nalways a quarter,<br/>\nalways a half,<br/>\nalways almost there,<br/>\nbut it'll never work out,<br/>\n<span style=\"color: gray\">I'll <em>never</em> be enough.</span></p>\n</div>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Nobody's here.</p>\n<p>Nobody's here anymore.</p>\n<p>Nobody's home.</p>\n<p>This home is just a house.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>I ground the corpse into a paste in an attempt to feel something. <span style=\"color: red\">Red</span> splattered the walls of my chamber, <span style=\"color: blue\">blue</span> grew the body, <span style=\"color: green\">green</span> spread the mold, yet it all felt so, so <span style=\"color: gray\">gray.</span> Numbness, emptiness, lackadaisical in every sense of the word.

Wrapped it around their throat and tightened as the fruits tumbled and fell. I caught a glimpse of their face: confused, petrified, struggling, weak. Slowly, it shifted to a ##blue|frozen blue## then a ##purple|poisonous purple## before they gave in. How they flailed, how their extremities failed to release themselves from my grasp. It almost felt rejuvenating. I almost felt alive\u2026\n\n\n\n##gray|//Almost.//##\n\n\n\nAlways teetering on the edge while my owner went and tripped. Pushed them off in an attempt to feel something. A heartbeat, a disturbance, some sense of movement. A half-something even, a quartered-halved-part of a feeling. But no, it's nothing. Nothing at all.\n\n\n\nSamples without tastes.\n\n\n\nBooks without pages.\n\n\n\nMouths without ears.\n\n\n\n##gray|A gap in the process.##\n\n\n\nI choked my owner to death in an attempt to feel something. Loosening my grip, I watched as their limp body dropped with a silent thud. Every day, they would make their usual for breakfast, took some berries and ice and the like, stuffed them in me for a whirl and a whisk. Tastes almost sweet, //almost// delectable. Something's always off, though. It never tasted like enough. Missing, missing a flavor, something to fill the hole. Every day, it felt empty. I knew nothing at all.\n\n\n\nFace planted on the ground, the sound of breathing ceased long ago. I thought some amusement would meet me here but I was only waiting, waiting, waiting for dead silence. Still bright outside, but bleak from where I stood. Fruit gathered ants, ants gathered flies. Gentle buzzing but it was quiet in between. Almost warm but cold nonetheless. Cold, cold, ##blue|//cold.//##\n\n\n\nI stood before a corpse growing cold in an attempt to feel something. Maybe some sense of regret, some sadness, relief, or realization. Not even boredom, I only knew numbness. The ceiling fan swirled in circles, a metaphor in a way. Always thought it would fall down, down, down eventually. This desperation for a struck chord, left to linger for forever. Something to stir the pot, something to ring a bell, something to keep me alive.\n\n\n\nAlive.\n\n\n\n[[size 125%]]Alive.[[/size]]\n\n\n\n[[size 150%]]//Alive.//[[/size]]\n\n\n\n[[size 175%]]//ALIVE.//[[/size]]\n\n\n\n[[size 200%]]##gray|//A L I V E.//##[[/size]]\n\n\n\nALIVE, I JUST WANT TO FEEL ALIVE.

What he wears is of course silk and satin, with gold and silver jewelry all around his neck, wrists and torso, the most luxurious.

The lords and the officials all take seats, with cheers and laughter erupting immediately. The majestic palace, decorated with gems of four colors, is now ready for a feast for hundreds and thousands, a hundred times livelier than the sights on the streets.\n\n\n\nThe four of them are dragged in. Bajie is of course the happiest, but even Sanzang has trouble refusing the invitation, and eventually they all sit down. The food provided is indeed the most precious, even the vegetarian food prepared specially for them is delicious indeed.

Having consumed many fruits, he asks the maids to get more. As he waits, he starts to watch the crowds. But with just a look, he gets a good scare indeed. What lords and officials, servants and guests, partying in the banquet? The ones that sit among the tables are no other than demons with claws and scales, not one person in sight. What cheers and laughter, song and dance? Only a terrible miasma covering all of it. Wukong is suddenly alarmed, and as he looks closely, he finds that Sanzang, Bajie, and Wujing are nowhere to be seen.

As he swings his staff, the guests immediately scatter, and are gone within a moment. The palace with four colors suddenly becomes dilapidated and desolate, as if not used in a long time, covered in filth and mud.\n\n\n\nUnable to find Sanzang and the others, and seeing that the palace is now empty, Wukong looks around with a sudden loss for what to do. As he is scratching his head in frustration, he looks up and sees the King of Aluojieda still sits on the throne, unmoving. Wukong steps towards the throne quickly, and plans to get some answers out of the King.\n\n\n\nWukong grabs the King by the collar, and the King goes limp. Wukong tries to lift him up, but the King is unmoving, as if nailed to the throne. Wukong looks more closely. What gold and silver jewelry on the King\u2019s person? They are heavy chains, layers upon layers, linked to the throne. And the clothing between the chains is no silk and satin, but tattered cloths wrapped together, with no person inside.\n\n\n\n> \u5927\u5723\u884c\u81f3\u6bbf\u5916\uff0c\u53ea\u89c1\u6574\u5ea7\u57ce\u90fd\u7a7a\u65e0\u4e00\u4eba\uff0c\u4e5f\u65e0\u706f\u706b\u3001\u7b75\u5e2d\uff0c\u6b64\u524d\u7684\u55a7\u56a3\u70ed\u95f9\u518d\u4e5f\u4e0d\u89c1\u4e86\u3002\u53c8\u9a7e\u4e91\u4e0a\u53bb\u4e00\u770b\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u4e4c\u9e26\u76d8\u65cb\uff0c\u597d\u4f3c\u4e00\u5ea7\u6b7b\u57ce\u3002\n\nWukong walks out of the palace, and sees the whole city devoid of person, with no lights and no feasts.

swirled the last dregs of rum in his glass, watching the liquid catch the light. He was in a bar \u2014 a custom for him whenever he was in Bahrain. The island country was one of the few places in the Arab world one could catch a drink without looking over one\u2019s shoulder. He took full advantage of that small liberty whenever he had a good reason to visit. He rarely did.</p>\n<p>Today was rare. It was a nice place \u2014 all fancy lighting, cocktails served in ridiculous glasses. Wood panelling on the bar and an impressive collection of spirits. It was a Saturday night, so the place was packed. Every Friday, as soon as work ended, the wealthy prodigal sons from Saudi Arabia would pile into their Mercedes and Range Rovers, and drive across the King Fahd Causeway that connected the two countries. They would arrive, and enter into an unspoken gentleman\u2019s pact to ignore each other\u2019s behaviour for the rest of the weekend. They would pretend not to notice the shots, the champagne, insist the nightclubs were upscale lounges and that the filet mignon was halal. For three days, they would get drunk off mead and live the life only the liberated of Riyadh could live. And come Monday, driving back across the bridge into Saudi Arabia, they would become good Muslim boys once again.</p>\n<p>Farhan held no strong judgements on them for their temporary debauchery. They weren\u2019t wretched because they were getting drunk; they were wretched because they were rich, hooting young men who had never known a day of work in their lives. Father\u2019s credit card and expense account took care of any inconveniences. One bumped into his shoulder at the bar, nearly spilling his drink; the boy, no older than twenty-five, muttered a quick apology in Arabic before launching back into a spirited discussion with his friends. Farhan didn\u2019t acknowledge it.</p>\n<p>He did acknowledge the fetching woman who took the seat on his other side. Not Arab, but not American like the rest of the clientele here. Eastern European, maybe? Dark hair, a strong face, in a beautiful red pencil dress. Ordered her cosmo with an accent. He put on his best, smarmiest smile. Women seemed to love it. \u201cYou\u2019re not from around here, are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>She smiled at him, and raised her voice slightly above the din. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not! Take a guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>He took the opportunity to intently study her face. She thought he was probably trying to figure out her background, and smiled. In his head, he was matching her to the picture on his phone. Finally, he smiled and snapped his fingers.</p>\n<p>\u201cBelarussian!\u201d</p>\n<p>She laughed. \u201cSerbian. And careful, the wrong person wouldn\u2019t take that well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you the right person?\u201d He threw in a flirtatious smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cI might be.\u201d She threw one right back at him. He knew he had her now.</p>\n<p>\u201cIntriguing. And how might we figure that out?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s start simple. What\u2019s your name?\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s start simple. What\u2019s your name?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck off.\u201d</p>\n<p>The man sitting across from him in the table cocks his head. He\u2019s Mukhabarat, but he doesn\u2019t look like the standard interrogators they would trot out. He has a soft, round face, full cheeks with no beard. He looks like someone\u2019s cousin, a friend that might come up to a function who no one really recognizes \u2014 forgettable, but perfectly blending in. The khaki uniform and maroon beret make him look like a child playing dress-up.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t have to be difficult, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Farhan looks around. The pair of them are in a concrete room \u2014 nearly identical to the cell he\u2019d been thrown in hours earlier, but slightly larger. Square, no defining features. Nothing except the chairs they were both in and the wooden table separating them.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re prepared for difficulty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m prepared for everything. But whether we go that route or not is your decision.\u201d</p>\n<p>Farhan smiles. \u201cI really don\u2019t know anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to ask.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I can tell you already I don\u2019t know anything. I assume you\u2019re asking me about anything. So there\u2019s no point in asking, is there?\u201d</p>\n<p>The man laughs. A light, airy giggle. \u201cI like you.\u201d</p>\n<p>For some reason, the laugh unnerves Farhan. He tries not to let it show. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo if I asked you about reports of a man matching your description being sighted around the cultural ministry before the alarms went off, you would have nothing to say?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would say that I am not a very unique looking man.\u201d He knows that\u2019s a lie, but he forges ahead. \u201cI have two eyes, a nose, a mouth, hair. Many do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMany do,\u201d the man agrees. \u201cNot many of them carry illegal firearms on their person.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was concerned about my personal safety. Times like these, you know. I\u2019m more than willing to pay any fine, but wouldn\u2019t this be a police matter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt would,\u201d he agrees.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why is someone from General Intelligence here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause,\u201d he begins, rising from his seat. He circles the table, with an odd, lurching gait \u2014 the impression us a hyena, inching toward its prey until he reaches just behind Farhan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cA crime that involves an ORIA agent is my jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p>Farhan blanches, and this time, he can\u2019t hide it. The man laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have fun together, lamb.\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you do for fun?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, this and that. Cook, travel. Talk to beautiful women in bars.\u201d</p>\n<p>She laughed. It was later now, and some of the folks had filtered out. The boys were lightweights with no meaningful tolerance, and that meant they left early. The expats were left, businesspeople and tourists.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p>\n<p>She thought about the question for a second, a fourth drink in hand. She didn\u2019t look soused, to her credit. \u201cNot much. All of my time goes to work.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, this and that,\u201d she parroted back to him.</p>\n<p>He pressed. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard of that job, honestly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously. I work for an international financial firm. We have lots of holdings here and in Riyadh, so they fly me out often.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLucky girl! You must be a proper regular here, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>An embarrassed smile. \u201cI wish. I barely speak Arabic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that hard of a language to learn. And very pretty. Flows like water.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIts beautiful,\u201d she agreed. \u201cAnd you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you asking if I\u2019m beautiful?\u201d he teased.</p>\n<p>She giggled. \u201cNo! What you do for work.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, nothing interesting there, I\u2019m afraid. I\u2019m just an office worker.\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m \u2014 just \u2014 an office \u2014 worker,\u201d Farhan gasps out stutteringly, teeth chattering. The ice water flows down his body, pools around his toes, then down the drain set into the middle of the room. There\u2019s a metal loop set into the concrete overhead, his arms forced up to meet it, then a cable run through it binding both arms behind and above him. The result is an agonizing stress position, where all the weight of his body is either on his feet or hanging from his arms. He\u2019s sure that he would\u2019ve passed out if it wasn\u2019t for the regular \u2018infusions\u2019 of ice water to keep him awake.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d the man answers matter-of-factly. \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me, lamb.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are an ORIA agent. You were on a mission of some kind. Tell me what.\u201d He\u2019s not yelling or screaming \u2014 the demand is simple, neatly phrased. Gentle, almost.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>His protests are cut off by another bucketful of ice water, thrown directly into his face. He gasps, taking in shaky breaths, hair matted to his forehead. He yells; an animal, guttural noise of shock. The better part of a minute passes before he can put words together again.</p>\n<p>\u201cS\u2014stop. Please.\u201d</p>\n<p>To Farhan\u2019s surprise, the man lowers the next bucket he already had raised.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you decided to share?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, I don\u2019t <em>know</em> anything. Please,\u201d he repeated. It feels like he\u2019s said that a hundred times in the past two days \u2014 the words are rote, mechanical.</p>\n<p>The man looks down at him, and for a moment, Farhan sees himself through the colonel\u2019s eyes \u2014 pathetic, hanging from his burning arms, soaked to the bone and shivering weakly.</p>\n<p>The colonel cocks his head. \u201cYou\u2019re cold. Let\u2019s get you warmed up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Farhan doesn\u2019t say anything, scared to ruin whatever small mercy this could end up being. He watches as the colonel strides to the metal door and raps sharply on it. A few seconds later, it opens, and someone passes something through. A charcoal carrier \u2014 the kind he\u2019d seen a thousand times in hookah bars, a small metal basket containing burning charcoals. In his shocked haze, he doesn\u2019t register its purpose for a second until the colonel approaches him, carrying the basket in one hand and a set of metal tongs in another. He starts writhing, futilely trying to pull away.</p>\n<p>\u201cFire is a magical thing, isn\u2019t it? Too cold, and you die. But too hot, and you\u2019ll wish you were dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo no no no! Please, wait, hold on\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s cut off by a bloodcurdling scream. It takes Farhan a moment to realize the scream came from himself, as the burning charcoal is pressed against the naked skin of his thigh. The telltale odor of burning flesh fills his nostrils, and he screams again, kicking his leg out. The charcoal clatters to the floor, steaming where it hits the pooled water. The colonel looks at it.</p>\n<p>\u201cPick it up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cW-what?\u201d Farhan groans.</p>\n<p>The colonel reaches over, drawing his knife from his belt. Farhan winces before he realizes the cable keeping his arms up for the past 6 hours is being sawed through. It snaps and he crashes to the floor in a heap, letting out another low scream as the blood rushes back into his limbs.</p>\n<p>\u201cPick up the coal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014 what? I can\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>The knife is against the back of his neck now. One plunge, and his spinal cord is severed. The message is clear. He swallows his pain and his pride and crawls across the freezing-wet concrete floor, to where the charcoal is still steaming.</p>\n<p>He looks back to the colonel. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me what you were looking for or pick it up.\u201d</p>\n<p>His chest heaves as he stares at the burning black rock for a few seconds. Then he leans down and wraps the fingers of his left hand around it.</p>\n<p>He screams immediately, but dipping his hand into the ice water gives him a second before the pain sets in, a second he uses to whip around and lunge at the colonel, burning charcoal outstretched.</p>\n<p>The colonel swiftly steps to the right. Dazed and confused, Farhan misses easily, crashing into a heap. The colonel wastes no time in dropping, placing a knee onto his back, twisting his arm behind him until he grunts and drops the charcoal. The skin of his hand is charred, bubbling.</p>\n<p>Farhan can\u2019t see him, but he can hear the amusement in the colonel\u2019s voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cLooks like we still need to break you. I always did like cooked lamb.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nobody outside the room hears Farhan\u2019s screaming as the colonel dumps the entire basket of burning coals onto his back.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll have the lamb shank,\u201d the woman told the server.</p>\n<p>Farhan winced, and she caught it.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot a fan of lamb?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA bad history with it. But don\u2019t let me spoil your fun.\u201d He turns to the waiter. \u201cI\u2019ll just do the tawook.\u201d The man nodded, taking both of their menus and leaving them again. They were still at the bar \u2014 the place was upscale enough that they also served food. Pretty good food, at that. Farhan nursed his fourth glass of pineapple rum while they waited for their food.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou seem like a much bigger heavyweight than most of the clientele,\u201d she commented.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, most Saudi guys have never had a sip of alcohol before coming here, right? You\u2019re pounding those back.\u201d</p>\n<p>He declined to mention that the alcohol vaporized in his mouth before he swallowed. \u201cWell, firstly, most of the rich bastards from there that can afford to drive down here every weekend aren\u2019t exactly bound by the dry laws.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t bars or anything, but I\u2019ve known people who had wine collections. Strictly as a financial asset, of course.\u201d He gave her a knowing smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course. So does that makes you a rich bastard who can afford to import it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGod, no. Well, at least I\u2019m not a <em>rich</em> bastard.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSimple. I\u2019m not Saudi.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. Oh! I\u2014 sorry, I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>He laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You\u2019re hardly the first person to make that mistake. I\u2019ve been called everything from Pakistani to Mexican. Ethnically ambiguous. Plus I speak English with an American accent, and that makes everything that much more confusing.\u201d</p>\n<p>She nodded slowly, still embarrassed. \u201cSo where are you really from, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been all over. But I was born and raised in Iran.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, wow. That\u2019s not\u2026 super common here, is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not. Things have cooled in recent years but Saudi Arabia and Iran still do not like one another. Barely ever let citizens of the other in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen how are you here?\u201d</p>\n<p>He smiled. \u201cI have friends in high places.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI assume you mean God, because I can\u2019t imagine who else would manage to get those two to agree on something.\u201d</p>\n<p>That actually got him to laugh. \u201cProbably not even him. Though I\u2019m not terribly sure I believe in God anymore.\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u201c<em>Allaahummak-fineehim bimaa shi\u2019ta.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Farhan whispers the prayer to himself, over and over, because there\u2019s nothing else to do in the coffin. It\u2019s a long, narrow metal box, just wide and tall enough to fit a person with hardly any room to wriggle. Moving his shoulders two inches to the right hit the wall, and the same on the left. There wasn\u2019t enough depth to even bend his knees, so he stood with his legs locked. The pain set in after only half an hour.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t tell how long he\u2019s been inside. They\u2019d thrown him in unceremoniously, and he\u2019d heard the locks turning outside before they stepped away, leaving one parting message:</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you scream, we\u2019ll put a wet towel over the airholes.\u201d</p>\n<p>He hasn\u2019t screamed yet. The airholes were six holes in the \u2018ceiling\u2019, each about the diameter of his pinky \u2014 though with his arms pinned to his sides, he could only estimate. They are the only source of light and air into the box.</p>\n<p>He starts the prayer again. And again, and again, and again. He\u2019d gotten to seven-hundred-twenty-nine before he\u2019d lost count, keeping track on his fingers until the joints locked up.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s cold. It\u2019s so, so cold. And quiet. He can\u2019t hear a thing, not even the low sobbing of the other inmates that permeates the prison. Pure silence. It was calming at first, not having to think about what other horrors were being inflicted on those he can\u2019t see. Whether he\u2019d already suffered as they had, or whether he had yet to see what made them break. Then it became maddening, stifling, completely blocking his ability to think or keep track of time or his own thoughts. Now, he can\u2019t think at all.</p>\n<p>He kept repeating the prayer. A childhood memory swims to the forefront of his mind \u2014 in the mosque as a boy of no more than six, pulling at the hem of his father\u2019s thobe. His father kneeling on the intricately-embroidered carpet, hands wrapped into prayer, making a supplication. \u201c<em>Allaahummak-fineehim bimaa shi\u2019ta.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><tt>Ya\u2019allah, protect us from those who would do us harm, however you wish.</tt></p>\n<p>His father turns to him, and opens his mouth to speak. No sound comes out. His lips move, but nothing is expressed. Staring up at his father, Farhan realizes with a jerk that he can\u2019t remember how people sound.</p>\n<p>The scream he lets out isn\u2019t one of pain \u2014 it\u2019s an animal reaction. Reminding himself what a human sounds like. It echoes inside his chamber, and only after it reaches his ears does the graveness of his mistake register. For a few seconds, nothing happens, and he prays that the guard thought it was one of the other dozens of prisoners. That nobody heard it.</p>\n<p>Then he hears the metal door unlock, and he breaks. Loud, wracking sobs, contorting his body against the coffin. His forehead slams into the cold metal six inches in front of him. He hears the clicking of boots against the floor as someone approaches, trying to stifle his sobs.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease. I\u2019m sorry. Please\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s cut off as the meager light from the airholes vanishes. The whimpers turn into open, screaming begs. No response. Despite his training, he starts to hyperventilate. He can\u2019t do it. Tight spaces. Darkness. Restrictive. Claustrophobic. Suffocating. His head swims. In some logical part of his brain, he knows he can still breathe, but his throat tightens as the walls of the coffin move in, strangling him, crushing him\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cPLEASE!\u201d</p>\n<p>In one final act of desperation, he bangs his fists against the door \u2014 and it pops free. He tumbles out into a heap on the floor. The darkness recedes. His throat opens. He can breathe again. He sucks in greedy, desperate breaths before looking up at the black boots in front of him, following them up.</p>\n<p>The colonel, face as soft as ever. There\u2019s no cruelty in his expression \u2014 even as he crouches down and gently brushes Farhan\u2019s long hair back from where it has matted to his forehead with sweat, his movements are kind. He waits for the gears in Farhan\u2019s head to start turning again.</p>\n<p>\u201cI-it was unlocked?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe lock has been broken for years. With enough force, it comes free. But you didn\u2019t even try.\u201d His tone isn\u2019t mocking. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of you, lamb.\u201d</p>\n<p>Farhan keeps sucking in air. Trying to process his misery for the last who-knows-how-long was self-inflicted. His own fault.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt seems you don\u2019t do well in tight spaces.\u201d The colonel continues. \u201cBut at least your prayers were answered, in me.\u201d</p>\n<p>It takes another second for the statement to register. \u201cH\u2014how did you know I was praying?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I was here. I\u2019ve been sitting right here for the past eight hours. I heard every little <em>du\u02bf\u0101</em> and supplication.\u201d The colonel smiles down at him, showing his teeth. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t abandon my lamb. But are you ready to cooperate now?\u201d</p>\n<p>Farhan finds his head nodding, in spite of himself. It\u2019s a physical reaction. He can\u2019t stop it. But he opens his mouth anyway. \u201cPlease don\u2019t make me.\u201d</p>\n<p>The colonel\u2019s muscles tense, pulling away from Farhan\u2019s hair. \u201c\u2019Please don\u2019t make me.\u2019 Very telling phrasing. That you will if I force you to, but that you\u2019re scared of the repercussions if you do. From your handlers? From God?\u201d He got to his feet. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. Same solution either way.\u201d He pulled something off a table.</p>\n<p>A claw hammer.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just have to make sure you\u2019re more scared of my wrath than their\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p>Before Farhan can pull back, the colonel grabs and pins his arm against the concrete. The blood is still redistributing through his body \u2014 the sudden pressure alone makes him groan in pain.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho do you worship?\u201d The question is evenly-phrased and straightforward. It doesn\u2019t even occur to him to lie.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlla\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t even get the whole word out before the hammer smashes down onto his little finger. Farhan screams like a dying animal, thrashing desperately. But he\u2019s starving, weak, sleep-deprived \u2014 he can\u2019t do anything except scream as every bone in his finger is shattered, pulverized. The pain is blinding. He feels bile crawl up his throat and hot, salty tears spill from his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho do you honor?\u201d He knows it\u2019s a trick now, but he doesn\u2019t know what the trick is. In his dull agony and dazed confusion, he defaults to the same answer.</p>\n<p>\u201cAl\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Again.</p>\n<p>His ears are ringing so badly he doesn\u2019t even hear the scream leaving his mouth until it begins to die away. He can just see his ring finger. It\u2019s a crumpled, fracture mess that looks like it went through an industrial shredder, bent at all the wrong angles in the wrong directions. Both the ruined fingers are turning purple. He can\u2019t hold the bile back this time and vomits, spewing the greyish mixture onto the concrete in front of where his head is pinned. Some of it flows back against his face and into his mouth. The tears mix with it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho do you obey?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You</em>. You.\u201d</p>\n<p>There is a half-second where he expects the hammer to come down again, and reflexively tenses. Holds his breath. But it doesn\u2019t come. He opens his eyes, chest heaving.</p>\n<p>The colonel is smiling down at him. \u201cGood little lamb.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then he raises the hammer even higher. \u201cNow let\u2019s make sure you don\u2019t forget.\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><em>Don\u2019t forget, 589, 3am</em></p>\n<p>It\u2019s scrawled onto the back of the cocktail napkin in pretty blue pen, the one she\u2019d handed him before departing.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve got some business to take care of.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAt this hour?\u201d</p>\n<p>She shrugged. \u201cInternational finance. You learn to keep odd hours.\u201d</p>\n<p>The bar &amp; grill was nearly empty now \u2014 just the two of them, a few regulars, and the staff. They\u2019d be making last call any minute. He put on his best slightly-disappointed face.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a shame. This was one of the better nights I\u2019ve had in this place.\u201d</p>\n<p>She leaned down, intentionally giving him a not-insignificant view down the front of her cocktail dress. She planted a kiss on his cheek, leaving a lipstick smear behind. \u201cDoesn\u2019t have to end. Look inside.\u201d And then she was gone.</p>\n<p>He unwrapped the napkin. Inside was a keycard for a room at the Hilton Bahrain.</p>\n<p>And now here he was, at three in the morning, standing in front of an unfamiliar hotel room. He considered knocking, but then \u2014 she\u2019d <em>given</em> him a card, hadn\u2019t she? He slipped it into the reader, and the light blinked green. He gingerly opened the door, peeking inside.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>She was sitting on the couch, heels thrown off and legs up on the coffee table. Still in that red cocktail dress, an unopened bottle of red wine in front of her. Two glasses.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere I am.\u201d</p>\n<p>He moved in, closing the door behind him. He cast a look around \u2014 no obvious hiding spots for people or large weapons. It was a single queen room.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was starting to think you wouldn\u2019t show,\u201d she commented.</p>\n<p>\u201cI got a little lost. Never been in a fancy hotel like this,\u201d he lied.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you might be out of my league.\u201d</p>\n<p>She laughed and blushed. Just drunk enough to be flattered by any compliment, no matter how brazen.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, c\u2019mere. It\u2019s late. Let\u2019s not waste any more time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine what we\u2019d be wasting time from.\u201d</p>\n<p>She grabbed the hem of his jacket as he approached, pulling him in. He playfully resisted, letting them both \u2018naturally\u2019 fall onto the bed, her on top of him. \u201cWell,\u201d she purred, reaching at something. \u201cThat\u2019s interesting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWoah, girl.\u201d</p>\n<p>She pulled her hand back, quieting. \u201cI\u2019ve been a good girl, haven\u2019t I?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTonight? Sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo indulge my curiosity about something?\u201d</p>\n<p>He cocked his head. \u201cIs it about the eye?\u201d</p>\n<p>She reached a hand up, teasing the hem of the eyepatch over his left eye.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry. I don\u2019t want to offend.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not offending. It\u2019s just not a very interesting story, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>A drop of blood pools on the edge of his brow. He\u2019s on his knees, forced forward by his arms behind him and suspended from the ceiling. It\u2019s an awkward position, designed to put immense stress on the shoulders and arms. Normally, he would be feeling the pain coming in dull, crashing waves \u2014 but at some point it all became too much. He dissociated, and now Farhan is watching his body contorted into shape from the outside.</p>\n<p>A month ago, he would\u2019ve been described as a handsome, curly-haired youth in his early twenties, with a proud face and a strong nose. Now he is unrecognizable, he thinks, gazing at his body from top to bottom. The hair is matted to his forehead with sweat and oil. Blood flows freely from his broken nose, catching in his stubble. He\u2019s naked \u2014 his body is an artwork of bruises, cuts, and burns. Wicked-looking purple and yellow splotches spread across his back, arms, and chest, from the constant and uncomplicated beatings. His thighs and calves are dotted with burnt, charred skin that has melted and healed on itself, over and over as the hot coals were applied. Dark circles cut across his arms where a tourniquet was used to cut off blood flow for hours. Every single finger on both of his hands was a fractured, crushed mess, beaten bloody with a hammer until he went into shock.</p>\n<p>A single, huge purple welt wraps around his neck where he was collared \u2014 a steel band with a leash wrapped around his throat, then used to shove him against a brick wall, yank him back, and shove him again. At one point, his head snapped back and collided with the brick. He woke up twelve minutes later when they waved bath salts under his nose. He couldn\u2019t remember his own name for an hour.</p>\n<p>The soles of his feet are red and swollen from when they were rubbed with honey and presented to a box containing a fire ant colony. Not that it mattered, because he hadn\u2019t been given opportunity to walk for days. His ass was sore \u2014 they had withheld his water for two days before delivering a sudden, shocking burst of ice water through an enema, mixed with a few drops of chili oil. He had tried to vomit, but there was so little food in his stomach that the only thing to escape was the water he had accidentally swallowed while being waterboarded. His penis had a shallow cut in the skin from where a box cutter had been pressed while a rubber-gloved hand groped him. He\u2019d been told that if he didn\u2019t speak, the blade would sever neatly through his genitals, castrating him. They\u2019d press a hot iron against the wound, cauterize it and leave him a eunuch.</p>\n<p>And every step of the way, he\u2019d given them what they wanted.</p>\n<p>They\u2019d broken him, that night in the coffin. Playing on his worst claustrophobia, the fear that they had no way of knowing. And once that dam was breached, the rest was a matter of applying pressure. Between the agonies and the punishments, he\u2019d told them everything. That he was an ORIA operative from Tehran. That he\u2019d been living in Aswan for months, lying low and waiting for his opportunity. Of the sword in the Nubian Museum, the one that could cleave through a sea if wielded right. How it was looted during the Arab conquests, how it belonged to the <em>ummah</em> as a whole. How a defector from Egyptian intelligence had given him the inside loop on getting it back. He gave it all up, between sobs and screams and tears. For two weeks, the Colonel worked him day and night, cutting him up, figuring out every aspect of how this had eluded the system. In time, with pain, every question was answered.</p>\n<p>Except one.</p>\n<p>The metal door clunks open. Farhan\u2019s mind is snatched back into his body, and he looks up from the pool of blood, sweat, and piss that has formed underneath him. It is the only person it can be. The colonel strides up to him, giving him a pitiable look. He\u2019s in a sorry state.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you reconsidered?\u201d</p>\n<p>Farhan just pants in response.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to find out anyway. An ORIA safehouse in this country cannot go undetected for long.\u201d</p>\n<p>He ekes out a reply. \u201cIt\u2026 has for\u2026 this\u2026 long\u2026\u201d His voice trails off. Putting the short phrase together sapped all the strength he had left.</p>\n<p>This is all he has. This is the last shred of honor he can salvage for himself \u2014 to die without giving up his countrymen. He knows he will die. This is no more a matter of question than the sun rising. But if he keeps his silence, he dies with dignity. If not, he dies a traitor and a coward.</p>\n<p><em>I am not a coward. I am not a coward. I am not a coward.</em></p>\n<p>He lets the phrase bounce around his head, cutting through the fog and confusion in his mind. He doesn\u2019t remember the last time he slept for more than a few minutes at a time \u2014 the noise machines in the cell were installed two (three?) days ago, constantly playing a loop of screaming, gunfire, artillery, animals being slaughtered, women being assaulted, baying of wolves, dropping of bombs. Trying to put a thought together is like walking through a warzone with an iron spike through his skull.</p>\n<p>The colonel tuts.</p>\n<p>\u201cA shame. I suppose that\u2019s the end of you, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>His chest heaves. He knows he should be terrified, desperate. But all that has been beaten, burned, torn out of him. All he can feel is relief as the colonel pulls his chin upward. Relief that the pain is finally over. Maybe he\u2019ll get to make amends in jannah. Maybe he\u2019ll see his father.</p>\n<p>Then he realizes the two other prison officers coming in to grip him from behind. He\u2019s already bound, he can\u2019t move. Why would they hold him if they were going to kill him? He makes a noise of confusion.</p>\n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t given up on you yet, lamb. You\u2019ve been so good for me. You\u2019ve given us so much. It\u2019s just that last little bit that\u2019s being troublesome. And I still believe we can work it out of you with the proper motivation.\u201d He turns away to the table. \u201cDo you know what the first thing I noticed about you was?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWuh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour eyes. They\u2019re beautiful. Rich and deep and brown. I\u2019ve spent much time in the West \u2014 they like their blond hair and blue eyes, but I\u2019ve always felt the colors you see among our peoples are so much more striking. And yours are a truly remarkable set. They have a depth and soul to them.\u201d He turned around again, raising something up. \u201cUnfortunately, you seem to be wasting them. You refuse to see the bigger picture. This is larger than you, lamb. This is about the struggle of nations, for legitimacy as the world order crumbles. And if you refuse to see, what use are your eyes?\u201d</p>\n<p>It was a power drill. A long, thin bit sat at the end.</p>\n<p>Farhan\u2019s eyes widen. All the peace and resignation for his death he felt a moment ago evaporated.</p>\n<p>\u201cHold him. Don\u2019t struggle, lamb \u2014 I don\u2019t want this to be a lobotomy.\u201d</p>\n<p>He screams, thrashing. But the guards already have a tight grip on his head, neck, and arms. He can\u2019t move, only watch as the colonel draws closer, spinning up the drill. One of the guards tilts his head back, and he lets out one last, wild scream to anyone who would listen or help.</p>\n<p>No one comes.</p>\n<p>The bit stops a centimeter away from his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cChoose.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cP-please.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cChoose, or I\u2019ll take both.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s an impossible choice, the definition of an impossible choice. But he has to make it. His head swims, and bile creeps up his throat. His stomach feels like a bottomless pit, and he surrenders to fate.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026L-left.\u201d</p>\n<p>There is no hesitation. One of the guards forces his eyelids apart with a spreader and the drill spins up again, letting out a <em>whirrrrrr</em> as the colonel drives it cleanly into Farhan\u2019s left eye. There\u2019s a mote of resistance, and then it breaks through, shredding the jelly-like interior of his eye. Farhan\u2019s vision twists, goes red, then black, and then he doesn\u2019t see anything at all.</p>\n<p>He screams like the devil himself, bucking and thrashing fruitlessly. It can\u2019t have been in his eye for more than a handful of seconds, but it\u2019s a lifetime of pain. Every nerve in his eye socket is on fire, like a match has been thrown into his head. His blood boils and his teeth gnash. When the drill recedes, he does completely limp in the legs, hands scrabbling up to his face, clawing at his eye for something that isn\u2019t there anymore.</p>\n<p>\u201cMake your decision, lamb. Or I\u2019ll be back in the morning for the next one. And after that, you won\u2019t have anything left to give me.\u201d The door slams shut.</p>\n<p>Lying there in a pool of his own blood, half-blind, howling at God for abandoning him, Farhan Moradi dies.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>He fucked lifelessly and mechanically. He was a corpse puppeteered by mechanisms, thrusting into her with a dull, regular rhythm. To her credit, she didn\u2019t seem to mind, moaning and panting underneath him \u2014 even without putting his heart into it, he was good enough to satisfy. That made him feel a little better.</p>\n<p>Casual sex had always been a given for him, but it offered diminishing returns \u2014 at one point, years ago, it was how he reminded himself he was still alive. The endorphins would rush through his veins, his heart rate would spike, the adrenaline would electrify his body while he wrestled with someone in bed. It was a rush, a high. Then the high stopped being so high, and he would lay awake afterward, staring at the ceiling, naked, next to someone deep in sleep, wondering what was wrong with him. Now, it was more routine than anything. He found someone at a bar, he said all the right words, they went to their place (never his place), and he fucked like a dead thing for a few hours. He was gone before morning.</p>\n<p>There was someone who had made him feel alive again, a few years ago. But she was gone now. And he'd probably never see her again.</p>\n<p>In any case, this wasn\u2019t that \u2014 this was business. Business, he told himself, as skin slapped against skin and her moans filled the dark hotel room, as fluids spilled onto the hundred-dollar sheets and the bottle of wine sat unopened on the coffee table. As he tries not to focus on the canvas of scars decorating the parts of his body usually hidden by clothes. Business.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>That night, in his cell, Farhan is visited.</p>\n<p>The guards untied him from his position in the interrogation room and hosed him down. Some rudimentary first aid was applied to make sure he didn\u2019t bleed out overnight, and then he was dumped unceremoniously into his cell. A thick piece of fabric was tied around half of his head \u2014 it made his skull feel weighty. It took all his strength to crawl onto the mat before passing out.</p>\n<p>He does not awake when he is visited. He does not stir at the sound of the two loud <em>thumps</em> outside several hours later, like bodies hitting concrete. He is not awakened by the door unlocking, or the footsteps creeping up to his mat. He is lost in the abyss as a set of hands lifts him up, checks his pulse and spine, cradles his head, inspects his wounds. He does not hear the swift expressions of shock at the brutality of his injuries, nor the <em>du\u02bf\u0101</em> quickly whispered over his supine form. He does not notice as a multitude of strong hands lift his body up into a bridal carry. He does not feel the temperature change on his skin as they quietly, swiftly leave the concrete of the prison, slipping into the cool night.</p>\n<p>Farhan Moradi dies in that Egyptian prison. Someone else exits that night.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Farhan leaned against the doorframe of the bathroom. The woman was inside, running a warm bath. She gave him a glance as he fills the doorway, letting the sheet fall to the floor. She smiled, not seeing what he was holding just out of sight.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was fun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was,\u201d he lied.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou never did tell me what you do for work.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNeither did you.\u201d</p>\n<p>She cocked her head, confused.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I told you \u2014 finance.\u201d</p>\n<p>He shook his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re an upper manager for Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd.\u201d He watched the blood drain out of her face before he continued. \u201cFor the past seven years, you\u2019ve been the Vice President of the Middle Eastern Office. Under your influence and direction, MC&amp;D has shifted its focus away from providing petrobillionaires and oligarchs with expensive novelties and anomalous toys, and towards supplying power-hungry dictators with anomalous arms. Your private auctions in Riyadh, Cairo, Damascus, Tehran \u2014 responsible for tens, hundreds of thousands of deaths in regional conflicts. Now every autocrat knows he can get something better than yellowcake at half the price of a nuclear programme.\u201d</p>\n<p>He pushed into the bathroom, letting his size fill the room. His eye burned under the patch.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re attending a private auction in Manama in seven hours, arranged by yourself. You will be selling an explosive package the size of a water bottle that can level New York City. You\u2019re expected to walk away in excess of a billion dollars, and fifty million of that is your personal commission. The dictators trust you personally \u2014 without you, there is no auction. You\u2019re dealing death on a massive scale, and getting filthy rich off it. And no one is doing anything to stop you.\u201d</p>\n<p>She backed away.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho the fuck are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>He adopted a simple, impassive tone he learned from a man in an Egyptian prison twenty years ago. It makes it easier to divorce himself from his actions, pretend it\u2019s someone else about to do what he\u2019s about to do.</p>\n<p>\u201cSomeone being paid to stop you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He lunged at the exact same time she went for the bathroom drawer. A small snubnose pistol, tiny enough to hide anywhere. He cursed himself for not checking earlier as she fumbled with it. Even armed, it isn\u2019t really a contest \u2014 she had no combat training, no idea how to use a firearm in close quarters. He dropped into stance while she was still grabbing at the gun, delivering a sharp hand directly into her ribs. She gasped, and it dropped to the floor. They struggle violently for a second, wrestling around for control of the gun. She wrapped her fingers around the barrel a half-second before his other hand landed on top of hers, trapping it, raising it up and twisting her body. If it went off, it would attract undue attention. His other hand went to the back of her head. He had been hoping to resolve this without a mess. No such luck.</p>\n<p>He slammed her head down, directly into the corner of the toilet tank. The white porcelain turned red and cracked. Her grip on the gun weakened, but didn\u2019t release. He slammed her head again, grunting with the exertion. The ceramic shattered, her skull caved in, and she went limp. He wrapped his fingers into the hair in the back of her head, then dragged her over to the bath. It was full. He dunked her head below, watched the red fill the tub, and held her there until the bubbles stopped.</p>\n<p>He let himself drop to the tile floor in exhaustion, back against the tile wall of the tub. The woman\u2019s corpse was inches away from him.</p>\n<p>He waited for the wracking, heaving sobs to overtake him. They never came.</p>\n<hr/>\n\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"rnb-navbar\">\n<div class=\"rnb-item rnb-last\">\n<p><a href=\"/warpaint\" style=\"display: block;\"><span class=\"rnb-supertitle\">PREVIOUS</span><br/>\n\u00ab WARPAINT \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rnb-item rnb-current\">\n<p><a href=\"/redtape\">REDTAPE</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rnb-item rnb-next\">\n<p><a href=\"/secure-facility-dossier-site-7\" style=\"display: block;\"><span class=\"rnb-supertitle\">NEXT</span><br/>\n\u00ab SITE-7 DOSSIER \u00bb</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n</div></body></html>", "raw_source": "\n\t[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:adult-content-warning\">:scp-wiki:component:adult-content-warning</a>\n\n|torture=1\n\n|sexual-assault=1\n\n|sexually-explicit=1\n\n|gore=1\n\n]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/more-by:rounderhouse\">:scp-wiki:more-by:rounderhouse</a>\n\n|color=#9b0000\n\n]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:info-ayers\">:scp-wiki:component:info-ayers</a>\n\n|lang=en[!-- EN/RU/KO/CN/FR/PL/ES/TH/JP/DE/IT/UA/PTBR --]\n\n|page=replica[!-- url of your page on the scp wiki --]\n\n|authorPage=http://www.scp-wiki.net/rounderhouse-s-author-page[!-- link to your author page --]\n\n|comments= Coming Soon - Rounderhouse\n\n]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[module Rate]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/theme:black-highlighter-theme\">:scp-wiki:theme:black-highlighter-theme</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:rso\">:scp-wiki:component:rso</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/theme:redtape\">:scp-wiki:theme:redtape</a>\n\n|years=8\n\n|dark=--]\n\n]]\n\n[[module CSS]]\n\n.sign {\n\nbackground-blend-mode: difference;\n\n}\n\n\n\n.ature, .ature a, .ature a:visited, .sign p {\n\n\u00a0\u00a0color: #ececec!important;\n\n}\n\n[[/module]]\n\n\n\n[[=image torturous.png class=\"angled\"]]\n\n\n\nFarhan swirled the last dregs of rum in his glass, watching the liquid catch the light. He was in a bar \u2014 a custom for him whenever he was in Bahrain. The island country was one of the few places in the Arab world one could catch a drink without looking over one\u2019s shoulder. He took full advantage of that small liberty whenever he had a good reason to visit. He rarely did.\n\n\n\nToday was rare. It was a nice place \u2014 all fancy lighting, cocktails served in ridiculous glasses. Wood panelling on the bar and an impressive collection of spirits. It was a Saturday night, so the place was packed. Every Friday, as soon as work ended, the wealthy prodigal sons from Saudi Arabia would pile into their Mercedes and Range Rovers, and drive across the King Fahd Causeway that connected the two countries. They would arrive, and enter into an unspoken gentleman\u2019s pact to ignore each other\u2019s behaviour for the rest of the weekend. They would pretend not to notice the shots, the champagne, insist the nightclubs were upscale lounges and that the filet mignon was halal. For three days, they would get drunk off mead and live the life only the liberated of Riyadh could live. And come Monday, driving back across the bridge into Saudi Arabia, they would become good Muslim boys once again.\n\n\n\nFarhan held no strong judgements on them for their temporary debauchery. They weren\u2019t wretched because they were getting drunk; they were wretched because they were rich, hooting young men who had never known a day of work in their lives. Father\u2019s credit card and expense account took care of any inconveniences. One bumped into his shoulder at the bar, nearly spilling his drink; the boy, no older than twenty-five, muttered a quick apology in Arabic before launching back into a spirited discussion with his friends. Farhan didn\u2019t acknowledge it. \n\n\n\nHe did acknowledge the fetching woman who took the seat on his other side. Not Arab, but not American like the rest of the clientele here. Eastern European, maybe? Dark hair, a strong face, in a beautiful red pencil dress. Ordered her cosmo with an accent. He put on his best, smarmiest smile. Women seemed to love it. \u201cYou\u2019re not from around here, are you?\u201d\n\n\n\nShe smiled at him, and raised her voice slightly above the din. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not! Take a guess.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe took the opportunity to intently study her face. She thought he was probably trying to figure out her background, and smiled. In his head, he was matching her to the picture on his phone. Finally, he smiled and snapped his fingers.\n\n\n\n\u201cBelarussian!\u201d\n\n\n\nShe laughed. \u201cSerbian. And careful, the wrong person wouldn\u2019t take that well.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAre you the right person?\u201d He threw in a flirtatious smile.\n\n\n\n\u201cI might be.\u201d She threw one right back at him. He knew he had her now. \n\n\n\n\u201cIntriguing. And how might we figure that out?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s start simple. What\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s start simple. What\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFuck off.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe man sitting across from him in the table cocks his head. He\u2019s Mukhabarat, but he doesn\u2019t look like the standard interrogators they would trot out. He has a soft, round face, full cheeks with no beard. He looks like someone\u2019s cousin, a friend that might come up to a function who no one really recognizes \u2014 forgettable, but perfectly blending in. The khaki uniform and maroon beret make him look like a child playing dress-up.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t have to be difficult, you know.\u201d\n\n\n\nFarhan looks around. The pair of them are in a concrete room \u2014 nearly identical to the cell he\u2019d been thrown in hours earlier, but slightly larger. Square, no defining features. Nothing except\u00a0\u00a0the chairs they were both in and the wooden table separating them.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re prepared for difficulty.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m prepared for everything. But whether we go that route or not is your decision.\u201d\n\n\n\nFarhan smiles. \u201cI really don\u2019t know anything.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to ask.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBut I can tell you already I don\u2019t know anything. I assume you\u2019re asking me about anything. So there\u2019s no point in asking, is there?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe man laughs. A light, airy giggle. \u201cI like you.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor some reason, the laugh unnerves Farhan. He tries not to let it show. \u201cThanks.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSo if I asked you about reports of a man matching your description being sighted around the cultural ministry before the alarms went off, you would have nothing to say?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI would say that I am not a very unique looking man.\u201d He knows that\u2019s a lie, but he forges ahead. \u201cI have two eyes, a nose, a mouth, hair. Many do.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMany do,\u201d the man agrees. \u201cNot many of them carry illegal firearms on their person.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI was concerned about my personal safety. Times like these, you know. I\u2019m more than willing to pay any fine, but wouldn\u2019t this be a police matter?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt would,\u201d he agrees. \n\n\n\n\u201cThen why is someone from General Intelligence here?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBecause,\u201d he begins, rising from his seat. He circles the table, with an odd, lurching gait \u2014 the impression us a hyena, inching toward its prey until he reaches just behind Farhan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cA crime that involves an ORIA agent is my jurisdiction.\u201d\n\n\n\nFarhan blanches, and this time, he can\u2019t hide it. The man laughs.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have fun together, lamb.\u201d\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you do for fun?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, this and that. Cook, travel. Talk to beautiful women in bars.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe laughed. It was later now, and some of the folks had filtered out. The boys were lightweights with no meaningful tolerance, and that meant they left early. The expats were left, businesspeople and tourists.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat about you?\u201d\n\n\n\nShe thought about the question for a second, a fourth drink in hand. She didn\u2019t look soused, to her credit. \u201cNot much. All of my time goes to work.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you do?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, this and that,\u201d she parroted back to him. \n\n\n\nHe pressed. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard of that job, honestly.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSeriously. I work for an international financial firm. We have lots of holdings here and in Riyadh, so they fly me out often.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cLucky girl! You must be a proper regular here, then.\u201d\n\n\n\nAn embarrassed smile. \u201cI wish. I barely speak Arabic.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that hard of a language to learn. And very pretty. Flows like water.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIts beautiful,\u201d she agreed. \u201cAnd you?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAre you asking if I\u2019m beautiful?\u201d he teased.\n\n\n\nShe giggled. \u201cNo! What you do for work.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, nothing interesting there, I\u2019m afraid. I\u2019m just an office worker.\u201d\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m \u2014 just \u2014 an office \u2014 worker,\u201d Farhan gasps out stutteringly, teeth chattering. The ice water flows down his body, pools around his toes, then down the drain set into the middle of the room. There\u2019s a metal loop set into the concrete overhead, his arms forced up to meet it, then a cable run through it binding both arms behind and above him. The result is an agonizing stress position, where all the weight of his body is either on his feet or hanging from his arms. He\u2019s sure that he would\u2019ve passed out if it wasn\u2019t for the regular \u2018infusions\u2019 of ice water to keep him awake.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d the man answers matter-of-factly. \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me, lamb.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou are an ORIA agent. You were on a mission of some kind. Tell me what.\u201d He\u2019s not yelling or screaming \u2014 the demand is simple, neatly phrased. Gentle, almost.\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\nHis protests are cut off by another bucketful of ice water, thrown directly into his face. He gasps, taking in shaky breaths, hair matted to his forehead. He yells; an animal, guttural noise of shock. The better part of a minute passes before he can put words together again. \n\n\n\n\u201cS\u2014stop. Please.\u201d\n\n\n\nTo Farhan\u2019s surprise, the man lowers the next bucket he already had raised. \n\n\n\n\u201cHave you decided to share?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you, I don\u2019t //know// anything. Please,\u201d he repeated. It feels like he\u2019s said that a hundred times in the past two days \u2014 the words are rote, mechanical.\n\n\n\nThe man looks down at him, and for a moment, Farhan sees himself through the colonel\u2019s eyes \u2014 pathetic, hanging from his burning arms, soaked to the bone and shivering weakly. \n\n\n\nThe colonel cocks his head. \u201cYou\u2019re cold. Let\u2019s get you warmed up.\u201d\n\n\n\nFarhan doesn\u2019t say anything, scared to ruin whatever small mercy this could end up being. He watches as the colonel strides to the metal door and raps sharply on it. A few seconds later, it opens, and someone passes something through. A charcoal carrier \u2014 the kind he\u2019d seen a thousand times in hookah bars, a small metal basket containing burning charcoals. In his shocked haze, he doesn\u2019t register its purpose for a second until the colonel approaches him, carrying the basket in one hand and a set of metal tongs in another. He starts writhing, futilely trying to pull away.\n\n\n\n\u201cFire is a magical thing, isn\u2019t it? Too cold, and you die. But too hot, and you\u2019ll wish you were dead.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNo no no no! Please, wait, hold on\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s cut off by a bloodcurdling scream. It takes Farhan a moment to realize the scream came from himself, as the burning charcoal is pressed against the naked skin of his thigh. The telltale odor of burning flesh fills his nostrils, and he screams again, kicking his leg out. The charcoal clatters to the floor, steaming where it hits the pooled water. The colonel looks at it.\n\n\n\n\u201cPick it up.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cW-what?\u201d Farhan groans.\n\n\n\nThe colonel reaches over, drawing his knife from his belt. Farhan winces before he realizes the cable keeping his arms up for the past 6 hours is being sawed through. It snaps and he crashes to the floor in a heap, letting out another low scream as the blood rushes back into his limbs. \n\n\n\n\u201cPick up the coal.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2014 what? I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe knife is against the back of his neck now. One plunge, and his spinal cord is severed. The message is clear. He swallows his pain and his pride and crawls across the freezing-wet concrete floor, to where the charcoal is still steaming. \n\n\n\nHe looks back to the colonel. \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cTell me what you were looking for or pick it up.\u201d\n\n\n\nHis chest heaves as he stares at the burning black rock for a few seconds. Then he leans down and wraps the fingers of his left hand around it.\n\n\n\nHe screams immediately, but dipping his hand into the ice water gives him a second before the pain sets in, a second he uses to whip around and lunge at the colonel, burning charcoal outstretched.\n\n\n\nThe colonel swiftly steps to the right. Dazed and confused, Farhan misses easily, crashing into a heap. The colonel wastes no time in dropping, placing a knee onto his back, twisting his arm behind him until he grunts and drops the charcoal. The skin of his hand is charred, bubbling.\n\n\n\nFarhan can\u2019t see him, but he can hear the amusement in the colonel\u2019s voice.\n\n\n\n\u201cLooks like we still need to break you. I always did like cooked lamb.\u201d\n\n\n\nNobody outside the room hears Farhan\u2019s screaming as the colonel dumps the entire basket of burning coals onto his back.\n\n----\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have the lamb shank,\u201d the woman told the server.\n\n\n\nFarhan winced, and she caught it. \n\n\n\n\u201cNot a fan of lamb?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cA bad history with it. But don\u2019t let me spoil your fun.\u201d He turns to the waiter. \u201cI\u2019ll just do the tawook.\u201d The man nodded, taking both of their menus and leaving them again. They were still at the bar \u2014 the place was upscale enough that they also served food. Pretty good food, at that. Farhan nursed his fourth glass of pineapple rum while they waited for their food.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou seem like a much bigger heavyweight than most of the clientele,\u201d she commented.\n\n\n\n\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI mean, most Saudi guys have never had a sip of alcohol before coming here, right? You\u2019re pounding those back.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe declined to mention that the alcohol vaporized in his mouth before he swallowed. \u201cWell, firstly, most of the rich bastards from there that can afford to drive down here every weekend aren\u2019t exactly bound by the dry laws.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t bars or anything, but I\u2019ve known people who had wine collections. Strictly as a financial asset, of course.\u201d He gave her a knowing smile.\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course. So does that makes you a rich bastard who can afford to import it?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cGod, no. Well, at least I\u2019m not a //rich// bastard.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThen what?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSimple. I\u2019m not Saudi.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh. Oh! I\u2014 sorry, I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\nHe laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You\u2019re hardly the first person to make that mistake. I\u2019ve been called everything from Pakistani to Mexican. Ethnically ambiguous. Plus I speak English with an American accent, and that makes everything that much more confusing.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe nodded slowly, still embarrassed. \u201cSo where are you really from, then?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been all over. But I was born and raised in Iran.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, wow. That\u2019s not\u2026 super common here, is it?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not. Things have cooled in recent years but Saudi Arabia and Iran still do not like one another. Barely ever let citizens of the other in.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThen how are you here?\u201d\n\n\n\nHe smiled. \u201cI have friends in high places.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI assume you mean God, because I can\u2019t imagine who else would manage to get those two to agree on something.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat actually got him to laugh. \u201cProbably not even him. Though I\u2019m not terribly sure I believe in God anymore.\u201d\n\n----\n\n\u201c//Allaahummak-fineehim bimaa shi\u2019ta.//\u201d\n\n\n\nFarhan whispers the prayer to himself, over and over, because there\u2019s nothing else to do in the coffin. It\u2019s a long, narrow metal box, just wide and tall enough to fit a person with hardly any room to wriggle. Moving his shoulders two inches to the right hit the wall, and the same on the left. There wasn\u2019t enough depth to even bend his knees, so he stood with his legs locked. The pain set in after only half an hour.\n\n\n\nHe can\u2019t tell how long he\u2019s been inside. They\u2019d thrown him in unceremoniously, and he\u2019d heard the locks turning outside before they stepped away, leaving one parting message:\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you scream, we\u2019ll put a wet towel over the airholes.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe hasn\u2019t screamed yet. The airholes were six holes in the \u2018ceiling\u2019, each about the diameter of his pinky \u2014 though with his arms pinned to his sides, he could only estimate. They are the only source of light and air into the box. \n\n\n\nHe starts the prayer again. And again, and again, and again. He\u2019d gotten to seven-hundred-twenty-nine before he\u2019d lost count, keeping track on his fingers until the joints locked up.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s cold. It\u2019s so, so cold. And quiet. He can\u2019t hear a thing, not even the low sobbing of the other inmates that permeates the prison. Pure silence. It was calming at first, not having to think about what other horrors were being inflicted on those he can\u2019t see. Whether he\u2019d already suffered as they had, or whether he had yet to see what made them break. Then it became maddening, stifling, completely blocking his ability to think or keep track of time or his own thoughts. Now, he can\u2019t think at all.\n\n\n\nHe kept repeating the prayer. A childhood memory swims\u00a0\u00a0to the forefront of his mind \u2014 in the mosque as a boy of no more than six, pulling at the hem of his father\u2019s thobe. His father kneeling on the intricately-embroidered carpet, hands wrapped into prayer, making a supplication. \u201c//Allaahummak-fineehim bimaa shi\u2019ta.\u201d//\n\n\n\n{{Ya\u2019allah, protect us from those who would do us harm, however you wish.}}\n\n\n\nHis father turns to him, and opens his mouth to speak. No sound comes out. His lips move, but nothing is expressed. Staring up at his father, Farhan realizes with a jerk that he can\u2019t remember how people sound.\n\n\n\nThe scream he lets out isn\u2019t one of pain \u2014 it\u2019s an animal reaction. Reminding himself what a human sounds like. It echoes inside his chamber, and only after it reaches his ears does the graveness of his mistake register. For a few seconds, nothing happens, and he prays that the guard thought it was one of the other dozens of prisoners. That nobody heard it.\n\n\n\nThen he hears the metal door unlock, and he breaks. Loud, wracking sobs, contorting his body against the coffin. His forehead slams into the cold metal six inches in front of him. He hears the clicking of boots against the floor as someone approaches, trying to stifle his sobs.\n\n\n\n\u201cPlease. I\u2019m sorry. Please\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s cut off as the meager light from the airholes vanishes. The whimpers turn into open, screaming begs. No response. Despite his training, he starts to hyperventilate. He can\u2019t do it. Tight spaces. Darkness. Restrictive. Claustrophobic. Suffocating. His head swims. In some logical part of his brain, he knows he can still breathe, but his throat tightens as the walls of the coffin move in, strangling him, crushing him\u2014\n\n\n\n\u201cPLEASE!\u201d\n\n\n\nIn one final act of desperation, he bangs his fists against the door \u2014 and it pops free. He tumbles out into a heap on the floor. The darkness recedes. His throat opens. He can breathe again. He sucks in greedy, desperate breaths before looking up at the black boots in front of him, following them up.\n\n\n\nThe colonel, face as soft as ever. There\u2019s no cruelty in his expression \u2014 even as he crouches down and gently brushes Farhan\u2019s long hair back from where it has matted to his forehead with sweat, his movements are kind. He waits for the gears in Farhan\u2019s head to start turning again.\n\n\n\n\u201cI-it was unlocked?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe lock has been broken for years. With enough force, it comes free. But you didn\u2019t even try.\u201d His tone isn\u2019t mocking. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of you, lamb.\u201d\n\n\n\nFarhan keeps sucking in air. Trying to process his misery for the last who-knows-how-long was self-inflicted. His own fault.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt seems you don\u2019t do well in tight spaces.\u201d The colonel continues. \u201cBut at least your prayers were answered, in me.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt takes another second for the statement to register. \u201cH\u2014how did you know I was praying?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBecause I was here. I\u2019ve been sitting right here for the past eight hours. I heard every little //du\u02bf\u0101// and supplication.\u201d The colonel smiles down at him, showing his teeth. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t abandon my lamb. But are you ready to cooperate now?\u201d\n\n\n\nFarhan finds his head nodding, in spite of himself. It\u2019s a physical reaction. He can\u2019t stop it. But he opens his mouth anyway. \u201cPlease don\u2019t make me.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe colonel\u2019s muscles tense, pulling away from Farhan\u2019s hair. \u201c\u2019Please don\u2019t make me.\u2019 Very telling phrasing. That you will if I force you to, but that you\u2019re scared of the repercussions if you do. From your handlers? From God?\u201d He got to his feet. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. Same solution either way.\u201d He pulled something off a table. \n\n\n\nA claw hammer.\n\n\n\n\u201cI just have to make sure you\u2019re more scared of my wrath than their\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\n\nBefore Farhan can pull back, the colonel grabs and pins his arm against the concrete. The blood is still redistributing through his body \u2014 the sudden pressure alone makes him groan in pain. \n\n\n\n\u201cWho do you worship?\u201d The question is evenly-phrased and straightforward. It doesn\u2019t even occur to him to lie.\n\n\n\n\u201cAlla\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\nHe doesn\u2019t even get the whole word out before the hammer smashes down onto his little finger. Farhan screams like a dying animal, thrashing desperately. But he\u2019s starving, weak, sleep-deprived \u2014 he can\u2019t do anything except scream as every bone in his finger is shattered, pulverized. The pain is blinding. He feels bile crawl up his throat and hot, salty tears spill from his eyes. \n\n\n\n\u201cWho do you honor?\u201d He knows it\u2019s a trick now, but he doesn\u2019t know what the trick is. In his dull agony and dazed confusion, he defaults to the same answer.\n\n\n\n\u201cAl\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\nAgain.\n\n\n\nHis ears are ringing so badly he doesn\u2019t even hear the scream leaving his mouth until it begins to die away. He can just see his ring finger. It\u2019s a crumpled, fracture mess that looks like it went through an industrial shredder, bent at all the wrong angles in the wrong directions. Both the ruined fingers are turning purple. He can\u2019t hold the bile back this time and vomits, spewing the greyish mixture onto the concrete in front of where his head is pinned. Some of it flows back against his face and into his mouth. The tears mix with it.\n\n\n\n\u201cWho do you obey?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c//You//. You.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere is a half-second where he expects the hammer to come down again, and reflexively tenses. Holds his breath. But it doesn\u2019t come. He opens his eyes, chest heaving.\n\n\n\nThe colonel is smiling down at him. \u201cGood little lamb.\u201d\n\n\n\nThen he raises the hammer even higher. \u201cNow let\u2019s make sure you don\u2019t forget.\u201d\n\n----\n\n//Don\u2019t forget, 589, 3am//\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s scrawled onto the back of the cocktail napkin in pretty blue pen, the one she\u2019d handed him before departing. \n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got some business to take care of.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAt this hour?\u201d\n\n\n\nShe shrugged. \u201cInternational finance. You learn to keep odd hours.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe bar & grill was nearly empty now \u2014 just the two of them, a few regulars, and the staff. They\u2019d be making last call any minute. He put on his best slightly-disappointed face.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a shame. This was one of the better nights I\u2019ve had in this place.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe leaned down, intentionally giving him a not-insignificant view down the front of her cocktail dress. She planted a kiss on his cheek, leaving a lipstick smear behind. \u201cDoesn\u2019t have to end. Look inside.\u201d And then she was gone.\n\n\n\nHe unwrapped the napkin. Inside was a keycard for a room at the Hilton Bahrain.\n\n\n\nAnd now here he was, at three in the morning, standing in front of an unfamiliar hotel room. He considered knocking, but then \u2014 she\u2019d //given// him a card, hadn\u2019t she? He slipped it into the reader, and the light blinked green. He gingerly opened the door, peeking inside.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere you are.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe was sitting on the couch, heels thrown off and legs up on the coffee table. Still in that red cocktail dress, an unopened bottle of red wine in front of her. Two glasses.\n\n\n\n\u201cHere I am.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe moved in, closing the door behind him. He cast a look around \u2014 no obvious hiding spots for people or large weapons. It was a single queen room.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was starting to think you wouldn\u2019t show,\u201d she commented.\n\n\n\n\u201cI got a little lost. Never been in a fancy hotel like this,\u201d he lied. \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI think you might be out of my league.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe laughed and blushed. Just drunk enough to be flattered by any compliment, no matter how brazen.\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, c\u2019mere. It\u2019s late. Let\u2019s not waste any more time.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine what we\u2019d be wasting time from.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe grabbed the hem of his jacket as he approached, pulling him in. He playfully resisted, letting them both \u2018naturally\u2019 fall onto the bed, her on top of him. \u201cWell,\u201d she purred, reaching at something. \u201cThat\u2019s interesting.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWoah, girl.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe pulled her hand back, quieting. \u201cI\u2019ve been a good girl, haven\u2019t I?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cTonight? Sure.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSo indulge my curiosity about something?\u201d\n\n\n\nHe cocked his head. \u201cIs it about the eye?\u201d\n\n\n\nShe reached a hand up, teasing the hem of the eyepatch over his left eye.\n\n\n\n\u201cSorry. I don\u2019t want to offend.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not offending. It\u2019s just not a very interesting story, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\n\n----\n\nA drop of blood pools on the edge of his brow. He\u2019s on his knees, forced forward by his arms behind him and suspended from the ceiling. It\u2019s an awkward position, designed to put immense stress on the shoulders and arms. Normally, he would be feeling the pain coming in dull, crashing waves \u2014 but at some point it all became too much. He dissociated, and now Farhan is watching his body contorted into shape from the outside.\n\n\n\nA month ago, he would\u2019ve been described as a handsome, curly-haired youth in his early twenties, with a proud face and a strong nose. Now he is unrecognizable, he thinks, gazing at his body from top to bottom. The hair is matted to his forehead with sweat and oil. Blood flows freely from his broken nose, catching in his stubble. He\u2019s naked \u2014 his body is an artwork of bruises, cuts, and burns. Wicked-looking purple and yellow splotches spread across his back, arms, and chest, from the constant and uncomplicated beatings. His thighs and calves are dotted with burnt, charred skin that has melted and healed on itself, over and over as the hot coals were applied. Dark circles cut across his arms where a tourniquet was used to cut off blood flow for hours. Every single finger on both of his hands was a fractured, crushed mess, beaten bloody with a hammer until he went into shock.\n\n\n\nA single, huge purple welt wraps around his neck where he was collared \u2014 a steel band with a leash wrapped around his throat, then used to shove him against a brick wall, yank him back, and shove him again. At one point, his head snapped back and collided with the brick. He woke up twelve minutes later when they waved bath salts under his nose. He couldn\u2019t remember his own name for an hour.\n\n\n\nThe soles of his feet are red and swollen from when they were rubbed with honey and presented to a box containing a fire ant colony. Not that it mattered, because he hadn\u2019t been given opportunity to walk for days. His ass was sore \u2014 they had withheld his water for two days before delivering a sudden, shocking burst of ice water through an enema, mixed with a few drops of chili oil. He had tried to vomit, but there was so little food in his stomach that the only thing to escape was the water he had accidentally swallowed while being waterboarded. His penis had a shallow cut in the skin from where a box cutter had been pressed while a rubber-gloved hand groped him. He\u2019d been told that if he didn\u2019t speak, the blade would sever neatly through his genitals, castrating him. They\u2019d press a hot iron against the wound, cauterize it and leave him a eunuch. \n\n\n\nAnd every step of the way, he\u2019d given them what they wanted.\n\n\n\nThey\u2019d broken him, that night in the coffin. Playing on his worst claustrophobia, the fear that they had no way of knowing. And once that dam was breached, the rest was a matter of applying pressure. Between the agonies and the punishments, he\u2019d told them everything. That he was an ORIA operative from Tehran. That he\u2019d been living in Aswan for months, lying low and waiting for his opportunity. Of the sword in the Nubian Museum, the one that could cleave through a sea if wielded right. How it was looted during the Arab conquests, how it belonged to the //ummah// as a whole. How a defector from Egyptian intelligence had given him the inside loop on getting it back. He gave it all up, between sobs and screams and tears. For two weeks, the Colonel worked him day and night, cutting him up, figuring out every aspect of how this had eluded the system. In time, with pain, every question was answered.\n\n\n\nExcept one.\n\n\n\nThe metal door clunks open. Farhan\u2019s mind is snatched back into his body, and he looks up from the pool of blood, sweat, and piss that has formed underneath him. It is the only person it can be. The colonel strides up to him, giving him a pitiable look. He\u2019s in a sorry state. \n\n\n\n\u201cHave you reconsidered?\u201d\n\n\n\nFarhan just pants in response.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to find out anyway. An ORIA safehouse in this country cannot go undetected for long.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe ekes out a reply. \u201cIt\u2026 has for\u2026 this\u2026 long\u2026\u201d His voice trails off. Putting the short phrase together sapped all the strength he had left.\n\n\n\nThis is all he has. This is the last shred of honor he can salvage for himself \u2014 to die without giving up his countrymen. He knows he will die. This is no more a matter of question than the sun rising. But if he keeps his silence, he dies with dignity. If not, he dies a traitor and a coward. \n\n\n\n//I am not a coward. I am not a coward. I am not a coward.//\n\n\n\nHe lets the phrase bounce around his head, cutting through the fog and confusion in his mind. He doesn\u2019t remember the last time he slept for more than a few minutes at a time \u2014 the noise machines in the cell were installed two (three?) days ago, constantly playing a loop of screaming, gunfire, artillery, animals being slaughtered, women being assaulted, baying of wolves, dropping of bombs. Trying to put a thought together is like walking through a warzone with an iron spike through his skull.\n\n\n\nThe colonel tuts.\n\n\n\n\u201cA shame. I suppose that\u2019s the end of you, then.\u201d\n\n\n\nHis chest heaves. He knows he should be terrified, desperate. But all that has been beaten, burned, torn out of him. All he can feel is relief as the colonel pulls his chin upward. Relief that the pain is finally over. Maybe he\u2019ll get to make amends in jannah. Maybe he\u2019ll see his father.\n\n\n\nThen he realizes the two other prison officers coming in to grip him from behind. He\u2019s already bound, he can\u2019t move. Why would they hold him if they were going to kill him? He makes a noise of confusion.\n\n\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t given up on you yet, lamb. You\u2019ve been so good for me. You\u2019ve given us so much. It\u2019s just that last little bit that\u2019s being troublesome. And I still believe we can work it out of you with the proper motivation.\u201d He turns away to the table. \u201cDo you know what the first thing I noticed about you was?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWuh?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYour eyes. They\u2019re beautiful. Rich and deep and brown. I\u2019ve spent much time in the West \u2014 they like their blond hair and blue eyes, but I\u2019ve always felt the colors you see among our peoples are so much more striking. And yours are a truly remarkable set. They have a depth and soul to them.\u201d He turned around again, raising something up. \u201cUnfortunately, you seem to be wasting them. You refuse to see the bigger picture. This is larger than you, lamb. This is about the struggle of nations, for legitimacy as the world order crumbles. And if you refuse to see, what use are your eyes?\u201d\n\n\n\nIt was a power drill. A long, thin bit sat at the end.\n\n\n\nFarhan\u2019s eyes widen. All the peace and resignation for his death he felt a moment ago evaporated.\n\n\n\n\u201cHold him. Don\u2019t struggle, lamb \u2014 I don\u2019t want this to be a lobotomy.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe screams, thrashing. But the guards already have a tight grip on his head, neck, and arms. He can\u2019t move, only watch as the colonel draws closer, spinning up the drill. One of the guards tilts his head back, and he lets out one last, wild scream to anyone who would listen or help.\n\n\n\nNo one comes.\n\n\n\nThe bit stops a centimeter away from his face. \n\n\n\n\u201cChoose.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cP-please.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cChoose, or I\u2019ll take both.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s an impossible choice, the definition of an impossible choice. But he has to make it. His head swims, and bile creeps up his throat. His stomach feels like a bottomless pit, and he surrenders to fate.\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026L-left.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere is no hesitation. One of the guards forces his eyelids apart with a spreader and the drill spins up again, letting out a //whirrrrrr// as the colonel drives it cleanly into Farhan\u2019s left eye. There\u2019s a mote of resistance, and then it breaks through, shredding the jelly-like interior of his eye. Farhan\u2019s vision twists, goes red, then black, and then he doesn\u2019t see anything at all.\n\n\n\nHe screams like the devil himself, bucking and thrashing fruitlessly. It can\u2019t have been in his eye for more than a handful of seconds, but it\u2019s a lifetime of pain. Every nerve in his eye socket is on fire, like a match has been thrown into his head. His blood boils and his teeth gnash. When the drill recedes, he does completely limp in the legs, hands scrabbling up to his face, clawing at his eye for something that isn\u2019t there anymore.\n\n\n\n\u201cMake your decision, lamb. Or I\u2019ll be back in the morning for the next one. And after that, you won\u2019t have anything left to give me.\u201d The door slams shut.\n\n\n\nLying there in a pool of his own blood, half-blind, howling at God for abandoning him, Farhan Moradi dies.\n\n----\n\nHe fucked lifelessly and mechanically. He was a corpse puppeteered by mechanisms, thrusting into her with a dull, regular rhythm. To her credit, she didn\u2019t seem to mind, moaning and panting underneath him \u2014 even without putting his heart into it, he was good enough to satisfy. That made him feel a little better. \n\n\n\nCasual sex had always been a given for him, but it offered diminishing returns \u2014 at one point, years ago, it was how he reminded himself he was still alive. The endorphins would rush through his veins, his heart rate would spike, the adrenaline would electrify his body while he wrestled with someone in bed. It was a rush, a high. Then the high stopped being so high, and he would lay awake afterward, staring at the ceiling, naked, next to someone deep in sleep, wondering what was wrong with him. Now, it was more routine than anything. He found someone at a bar, he said all the right words, they went to their place (never his place), and he fucked like a dead thing for a few hours. He was gone before morning. \n\n\n\nThere was someone who had made him feel alive again, a few years ago. But she was gone now. And he'd probably never see her again. \n\n\n\nIn any case, this wasn\u2019t that \u2014 this was business. Business, he told himself, as skin slapped against skin and her moans filled the dark hotel room, as fluids spilled onto the hundred-dollar sheets and the bottle of wine sat unopened on the coffee table. As he tries not to focus on the canvas of scars decorating the parts of his body usually hidden by clothes. Business.\n\n----\n\nThat night, in his cell, Farhan is visited.\n\n\n\nThe guards untied him from his position in the interrogation room and hosed him down. Some rudimentary first aid was applied to make sure he didn\u2019t bleed out overnight, and then he was dumped unceremoniously into his cell. A thick piece of fabric was tied around half of his head \u2014 it made his skull feel weighty. It took all his strength to crawl onto the mat before passing out.\n\n\n\nHe does not awake when he is visited. He does not stir at the sound of the two loud //thumps// outside several hours later, like bodies hitting concrete. He is not awakened by the door unlocking, or the footsteps creeping up to his mat. He is lost in the abyss as a set of hands lifts him up, checks his pulse and spine, cradles his head, inspects his wounds. He does not hear the swift expressions of shock at the brutality of his injuries, nor the //du\u02bf\u0101// quickly whispered over his supine form. He does not notice as a multitude of strong hands lift his body up into a bridal carry. He does not feel the temperature change on his skin as they quietly, swiftly leave the concrete of the prison, slipping into the cool night.\n\n\n\nFarhan Moradi dies in that Egyptian prison. Someone else exits that night.\n\n----\n\nFarhan leaned against the doorframe of the bathroom. The woman was inside, running a warm bath. She gave him a glance as he fills the doorway, letting the sheet fall to the floor. She smiled, not seeing what he was holding just out of sight.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat was fun.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was,\u201d he lied.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou never did tell me what you do for work.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNeither did you.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe cocked her head, confused.\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah, I told you \u2014 finance.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo. You\u2019re an upper manager for Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd.\u201d He watched the blood drain out of her face before he continued. \u201cFor the past seven years, you\u2019ve been the Vice President of the Middle Eastern Office. Under your influence and direction, MC&D has shifted its focus away from providing petrobillionaires and oligarchs with expensive novelties and anomalous toys, and towards supplying power-hungry dictators with anomalous arms. Your private auctions in Riyadh, Cairo, Damascus, Tehran \u2014 responsible for tens, hundreds of thousands of deaths in regional conflicts. Now every autocrat knows he can get something better than yellowcake at half the price of a nuclear programme.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe pushed into the bathroom, letting his size fill the room. His eye burned under the patch.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re attending a private auction in Manama in seven hours, arranged by yourself. You will be selling an explosive package the size of a water bottle that can level New York City. You\u2019re expected to walk away in excess of a billion dollars, and fifty million of that is your personal commission. The dictators trust you personally \u2014 without you, there is no auction. You\u2019re dealing death on a massive scale, and getting filthy rich off it. And no one is doing anything to stop you.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe backed away. \n\n\n\n\u201cWho the fuck are you?\u201d\n\n\n\nHe adopted a simple, impassive tone he learned from a man in an Egyptian prison twenty years ago. It makes it easier to divorce himself from his actions, pretend it\u2019s someone else about to do what he\u2019s about to do.\n\n\n\n\u201cSomeone being paid to stop you.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe lunged at the exact same time she went for the bathroom drawer. A small snubnose pistol, tiny enough to hide anywhere. He cursed himself for not checking earlier as she fumbled with it. Even armed, it isn\u2019t really a contest \u2014 she had no combat training, no idea how to use a firearm in close quarters. He dropped into stance while she was still grabbing at the gun, delivering a sharp hand directly into her ribs. She gasped, and it dropped to the floor. They struggle violently for a second, wrestling around for control of the gun. She wrapped her fingers around the barrel a half-second before his other hand landed on top of hers, trapping it, raising it up and twisting her body. If it went off, it would attract undue attention. His other hand went to the back of her head. He had been hoping to resolve this without a mess. No such luck.\n\n\n\nHe slammed her head down, directly into the corner of the toilet tank. The white porcelain turned red and cracked. Her grip on the gun weakened, but didn\u2019t release. He slammed her head again, grunting with the exertion. The ceramic shattered, her skull caved in, and she went limp. He wrapped his fingers into the hair in the back of her head, then dragged her over to the bath. It was full. He dunked her head below, watched the red fill the tub, and held her there until the bubbles stopped.\n\n\n\nHe let himself drop to the tile floor in exhaustion, back against the tile wall of the tub. The woman\u2019s corpse was inches away from him. \n\n\n\nHe waited for the wracking, heaving sobs to overtake him. They never came.\n\n----\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[module Rate]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\n[[div class=\"rnb-navbar\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"rnb-item rnb-last\"]]\n\n[[a href=\"/warpaint\" style=\"display: block;\"]][[span class=\"rnb-supertitle\"]]PREVIOUS[[/span]]\n\n<< WARPAINT >>[[/a]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"rnb-item rnb-current\"]]\n\n[[a href=\"/redtape\"]]REDTAPE[[/a]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"rnb-item rnb-next\"]]\n\n[[a href=\"/secure-facility-dossier-site-7\" style=\"display: block;\"]][[span class=\"rnb-supertitle\"]]NEXT[[/span]]\n\n<< SITE-7 DOSSIER >>[[/a]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n", "references": ["prev", "next", "component:info-ayers", "warpaint", "redtape", "secure-facility-dossier-site-7"], "tags": ["_adult", "bleak", "horror", "oria", "psychological-horror", "spy-fiction", "tale"], "title": "LAMB OF GOD - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/lamb-of-god", "year": 2024}, "lets-get-you-home": {"created_at": "2024-01-04T22:52:00", "creator": "kingofmice", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "kingofmice", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/kingofmice", "comment": "", "date": "2024-01-04T22:52:00"}, {"author": "kingofmice", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/kingofmice", "comment": "Added tags: dr-clef.

Over the past couple of weeks he\u2019s become quite acquainted with several of them. Apparently it just wasn\u2019t enough for Clef to frequent one hole in the wall bar.</p>\n<p>At least once Gears mapped out every place Clef could be it was only a matter of process of elimination. Clef\u2019s truck sticks out like a sore thumb anywhere, especially the desolate parking lot of <em>The Bitter End</em>.</p>\n<p>Twenty minutes ago the last few bar goers stumbled out. The neon sign outside reads <strong>CLOSED</strong>, but through the tinted windows Gears can make out one single straggler.</p>\n<p>The door creaks as he enters and does not open all the way, forcing him to wriggle his way in. A lone, flickering, amber light illuminates the center of the bar, leaving the filthy sides obscured in darkness. Walking in, he finds the floor sticky, his well-kept shoes squelch against the floor.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s certainly not a place Gears would have ever <em>willingly</em> entered. The only two inhabitants are a very exhausted looking barkeep and a very drunk looking Clef. It\u2019s sweltering and yet Clef is bundled up in a ratty, brown jacket. The barkeep\u2019s eyes are void of any emotion.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re closed?\u201d he says, wearily. As Gears gets closer to the bar, the thick, burning smell of vomit gets stronger, making his nose scrunch up involuntarily.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d he says, voice flat. \u201cI am here to take my associate home.\u201d He puts a firm hand on Clef's shoulder, grasping it firmly. Clef flinches, nearly falling out of his chair.</p>\n<p>Clef looks over his shoulder quickly, swinging his hat into his face. He burps and blows a wet raspberry at Gears. \u201cCoggyyyyy baby, get the fuuuuck outta here.\u201d His words are slurred and Gears doesn\u2019t recognize the accent Clef is putting on.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s not acceptable.\u201d Gears wraps an arm around Clef\u2019s shoulders so he doesn\u2019t slip. Clef groans, flopping against Gears\u2019s torso. He hic-ups, prompting a wave of drunken giggles.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019<em>rrrrre</em> not acceptable,\u201d Clef says, breathless.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow much has he had to drink?\u201d Gears asks, turning his attention to the barkeep.</p>\n<p>Without a word, the barkeep slides a bill over the countertop. Gears\u2019s eye twitches as he glances over it. How Clef hasn\u2019t drunk himself into a coma speaks volumes to either Clef\u2019s tolerance or the alcohol quality this bar provides.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh- uh- Johnathan Tucker.\u201d Johnathan points to his illegible nametag.</p>\n<p>Keeping one hand on Clef, Gears pulls out his checkbook and fills out two sheets, one to cover Clef\u2019s binge and the other to personally compensate for Johnathan\u2019s time. Johnathan examines them, a withered smile pulling on his lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave a good night, sir!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGoodnight.\u201d Gears hoists Clef to his feet, fully prepared to drag Clef across the floor if need be; Clef ragdolls, apparently hellbent on being as unhelpful as possible.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is kidnapping!\u201d Clef spits, \u201cYou\u2019re letting this guy kidnap me!\u201d He points an accusatory finger in the general direction of the bar. He writhes, ineffectively pawing at Gears\u2019s arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave some maturity,\u201d Gears says, bordering on a growl. It was enough struggle trying to lug Clef\u2019s weight across the sticky ground <em>without</em> Clef actively fighting him.</p>\n<p>The crisp night air burns Clef\u2019s flushed face. He whines, letting drool run down his chin. Gears drags Clef to his car, dropping him off on the pavement. He pops open the passenger\u2019s side door.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m taking you home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t wannnnaaaaaa go home!\u201d Clef says with the cadence of a small child.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen we will go to <em>my</em> home. Either way you\u2019re not staying here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBooooo!\u201d Arms crossed, Clef sticks his tongue out and blows another raspberry.</p>\n<p>This is exhausting. After all the effort Gears took to find Clef and ensure his safety, he believes he\u2019s owed a little more <em>gratitude</em>. Perhaps he expected too much from his coworker.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you stand up?\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef grunts, making several attempts to sit up only to flop back down. He looks stupefied, like nothing could possibly explain his struggle. Gears sighs, getting down to haul Clef up again.</p>\n<p>He drags Clef towards the seat and pushes him in. He\u2019s stopped by Clef\u2019s hands shooting out and bracing against the roof of the car. Gears bares his teeth, putting his weight onto him.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Clef-\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cWait-!\u201d</em> Is all the warning Gears gets before Clef lurches forward, spewing his stomach onto Gears\u2019s leather seat. Gears roils.</p>\n<p>Clef spits, taking an uneasy step back. He holds onto the car, swaying like a branch. Vomit runs down his chin, clots in his facial hair, and drips onto his shirt. He rubs his face against his sleeve, smearing the bile further.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Sorrrry</em>,\u201d he mumbles, blowing a spit bubble.</p>\n<p>Gears stares at the ruined seat with contempt. He sucks in a deep breath through his teeth, determined not to lose his cool. He nudges past Clef, leaning over the vomit splatter for the paper towels he always keeps in there.</p>\n<p>He does his best to wipe down the seat and Clef\u2019s face. Clef can only offer a blank expression as Gears cleans him up. He tosses the soiled paper towels into a plastic bag and tries very hard not to think about it.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you feel like vomiting again?\u201d Gears asks, voice calm, like he\u2019s talking to a child.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>Gears puts his head in his hands. \u201cPlease get in the back seat.\u201d</p>\n<p>He shuts the passenger\u2019s side door, cracking open the back. Clef mumbles something, haphazardly flopping facefirst into the clean cushions. Gears reaches in and grabs a handful of Clef\u2019s hair, using that to force him upright.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay! Okay! I\u2019m up!\u201d Clef whines, getting in the correct position. Gears crawls into his lap and buckles him in. Clef flushes, turning his head to the side.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat ab-bout my truck?\u201d He waves a hand towards the truck in question.</p>\n<p>\u201cI will handle it.\u201d</p>\n<p>The drive is quiet, which Gears can only be thankful for. It\u2019s a struggle to keep his eyes open but the burning stench of vomit certainly keeps him from getting too relaxed.</p>\n<p>As the drive goes on he gets a crawling feeling down his back. <em>He swears he sees a figure in the passenger\u2019s seat. He\u2019s scared to look, fearing he might turn to see Iceberg rotting beside him.</em></p>\n<p>They pull up to a large <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span>, within walking distance of Site-19 and well away from anything that could be called a <em>community</em>. The only light is a single flickering street lamp. Clef groans, sits up, and squints at the building, not immediately recognizing it.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t my <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, this is my <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span>. You will come inside.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that an order, <em>sir</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would rather it not be.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taking him by the forearm, Gears leads him inside. The <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span> is dark and smells new, unlived in. Everything is unsettlingly clean. The furniture stands perfectly uniform and colorless. It\u2019s like he just walked into an air-freshened prison cell.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s an island between the kitchen and, what appears to be, the dining room. The white countertops look so clean that Clef thinks even a single grain of coke would stick out on its surface. Gears sits Clef at the table and fetches a glass of water.</p>\n<p>As Gears returns to Clef\u2019s side he holds the glass out as an offering. Clef crosses his arms and sticks his nose up.</p>\n<p>\u201cClef\u2026\u201d Gears says, patiently. \u201cPlease drink.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNuh-uh.\u201d Clef bites the inside of his lips, turning his head to the side as Gears continually tries to bring it up to them.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlto.\u201d Gears puts a firm hand on Clef\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>Clef opens his eyes, not realizing he closed them, and he finds himself not in Gears\u2019s home but <em>in an empty staff room at Site-19. He\u2019s not alone here, Kondraki stands beside him, leaning nonchalantly against the wall.</em></p>\n<p><em>They\u2019re close, too close, but in the tension of the moment Clef couldn\u2019t care less. Kondraki looks at him, eyes filled with\u2026 if Clef didn\u2019t know any better he would tell himself Kondraki was looking at him with affection.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not thirsty?\u201d he asks, waving his beer bottle in Clef\u2019s face. Clef gawks at him, half tempted to smack the bottle out of his hands.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t see how you drink that shit. It doesn\u2019t even have that much alcohol in it.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>Kondraki shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad once you get used to it.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cYeah, drinking acid isn\u2019t that bad either once you burn your tastebuds off.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>It wasn\u2019t that funny but Kondraki chuckles and Clef can\u2019t help but chuckle too. Kondraki leans in, looming over him, cheeks warm with alcohol and joy. He looks Clef in the eyes and for a moment Clef is captivated.</em></p>\n<p><em>Kondraki smirks, taking one long swig of his drink. He proceeds to push Clef up against the wall, pinning him there with his body. Heart hammering in his chest, Clef looks up, eyes wide.</em></p>\n<p><em>The world stops.</em></p>\n<p><em>The next thing he knows, Kondraki has his lips pressed against Clef\u2019s. Clef sinks into the feeling, practically going limp, moaning ever so softly. Then he feels the sting of carbonation and his shoulders tense. Kondraki\u2019s grip on him is strong, Clef can\u2019t spit it out.</em></p>\n<p><em>He swallows Kondraki\u2019s disgusting beer, feeling all the worse for it. Kondraki pulls back, that stupid grin plastered on his face. He licks his lips slowly, like he\u2019s mocking him.</em></p>\n<p><em>Wiping his face with the back of his wrist, Clef says, \u201cThat was the most disgusting thing you\u2019ve ever done to me.\u201d He pauses, looking Kondraki in the eyes. \u201c\u2026 You wanna do it again?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Clef\u2019s shoulders slouch. His eyes droop, not looking at Gears but locked onto something in the distance. The feisty energy visibly drains from his features. Gears takes advantage of the moment and has him drain the glass.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow\u2026 Was that so hard?\u201d Gears asks, setting the cup on the island.</p>\n<p>Clef turns to face him, quivering weakly, eyes wet with tears. Gears frowns and lets out a heavy sigh. He brushes the hair out of Clef\u2019s face and cups his cheek, feeling the warmth in his palm.</p>\n<p>Clef\u2019s hands shoot out, snatching either side of Gears\u2019s face. Gears fails to brace himself, barely managing to catch him on Clef\u2019s chair. Their lips jam together in an approximation of a kiss.</p>\n<p>Gears would be lying if he said he found the sensation unpleasant, but he will say so anyway. Clef\u2019s lips are chapped, the kiss is far too wet and sloppy, not to mention the taste of vomit.</p>\n<p>And yet\u2026 Gears can\u2019t bring himself to pull away, not immediately. There\u2019s a certain desperation to how Clef clings to him, how his fingers paw and scrunch up in his shirt and hair, the soft, needy noises he makes. It draws Gears in and leaves him entranced.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, this was unacceptable. He pulls back, straining out of Clef\u2019s persistent grasp. Clef mouths against his collar. Biting the inside of his lip, Gears yanks Clef\u2019s head back by his hair. He prays the warmth in his cheeks isn\u2019t visible.</p>\n<p>\u201cOuch!\u201d Cries Clef. \u201cDon\u2019t you like me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re inebriated,\u201d he says through gritted teeth, \u201cYou\u2019ll thank me in the morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef scoffs. \u201cGuh, <em>fuck you</em>. You could have <em>pussy</em> just <em>lined</em> up before you and you\u2019d still be a virgin.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gears shakes his head. He turns and walks into the kitchen, taking Clef\u2019s cup with him. This was just another one of Clef\u2019s tantrums. He turns on the sink, letting the cold water run over the glass. Anything to occupy his hands so he doesn\u2019t wring Clef\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t ignore me! Why won\u2019t you touch me?\u201d Clef drags himself out of the chair, leaning on the counter.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have stated my reasons.\u201d Gears turns the water up, hoping to drown him out.</p>\n<p>\u201cBullshh<em>hittttttttt</em>. Don\u2019t act like you\u2019ve never <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/this-world-is-as-you-would-have-wanted\">taken advantage of someone before</a>.\u201d</p>\n<p>The sink shuts off with a thunk. Gears glares at his reflection in the glass, hating the man looking back at him. He attempts to swallow a lump in his throat; his mouth runs dry.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 what do you mean by that?\u201d</p>\n<p>With his back to Clef he can\u2019t see his expression, but he can hear the sinister grin in Clef\u2019s next words.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be coy with me, Coggy. Trying to hide all the shit you were doing to Iceberg. You\u2019re a little <em>freak</em> aren\u2019t you? <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/in-his-own-image-part-3\">Bet that\u2019s why he shot himself</a>.\u201d</p>\n<p>The glass clangs against the bottom of the sink. A shot of adrenaline shoots through Clef\u2019s veins. He stumbles over the chair, backing himself into a wall as Gears stares him down, marching towards him with purpose.</p>\n<p>Clef opens his mouth, maybe to beg for mercy, maybe to scream. Whatever noise he wanted to make is cut off as Gears wraps his hand around his throat. It\u2019s not tight enough to block airflow, no, Gears is very precise about that. He pins Clef to the wall in a position that\u2019s oh so familiar and <em>oh so terrifying</em>.</p>\n<p>Clef wheezes, on the verge of hyperventilating. Gears can feel his speedy heartbeat under his fingers. It\u2019s refreshing, the scared look on Clef\u2019s face, how he uselessly worms about and claws at Gears\u2019s fingers. Tears and snot run down his crimson face.</p>\n<p>\u201cBreathe,\u201d Gears commands, keeping up the illusion of self control. \u201cI do not wish to hurt you, and I will not if you do not give me reason to. It would do you some good to <em>never</em> mention Dr. Iceberg to me again. Understood?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm-mhm!\u201d Clef tries his best to nod. He feels Clef\u2019s Adam's apple bob under his palm. Satisfied, and not wanting Clef\u2019s snot to drip onto his sleeve, Gears releases him.</p>\n<p>Once free, Clef crumbles onto the floor and hugs his knees to his chest. He struggles to breathe, each sharp gasp only burns. He sounds awful, raspy, like he\u2019s having an asthma attack. Gears turns his back to him, about to return to the kitchen.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou took everything from me\u2026 Why won\u2019t you just finish me off?\u201d</p>\n<p>Gears stills, feeling a heavy weight on his shoulders. He shakes his head and continues on. The glass is dried and returned to its place in the cupboard. While there, he fetches a roll of paper towels for Clef.</p>\n<p>He kneels down to Clef\u2019s level, cleaning off Clef\u2019s face for the second time. Clef sobs, choking on his own spit. Gears remains patient, finding something uncomfortably\u2026<em>familiar</em> in the position he\u2019s in.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy did he leave me?\u201d Clef mumbles, reaching up to grasp Gears\u2019s wrist. Gears\u2019s breath hitches.</p>\n<p>He combs his knuckles through Clef\u2019s hair, trying to soothe him. His trembles slow and his breathing settles. He pauses in his motions, taking a moment to glance around his empty home. He believes he has privacy and safety here, but he never wanted to be careless. Not when a dear friend is on the line.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know why he had to leave,\u201d Gears says, breath soft and warm against Clef\u2019s neck. Clef shivers, hair standing on him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair!\u201d He hunches forward, face in his hands, and dissolves into another fit of sobs. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have protected him?\u201d</p>\n<p>Pushing Clef flat against the wall, Gears jams the wad of paper towel over his mouth. \u201cI <em>did</em> protect him. Can\u2019t you understand? He was only in danger here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy couldn't he have taken me with him?\u201d Clef asks, shaky hands reaching up to grip the front of Gears\u2019s shirt. His eyes are empty.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause-\u201d Gears pries Clef\u2019s fingers off him, \u201c-he would have been safer without you. There <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-king-is-dead\">was a warrant for his execution</a>. If you had disappeared alongside him you would have put <em>everyone</em> at risk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Clef says, going slack. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know\u2026\u201d Gears reaches out and plucks off Clef\u2019s hat. He caresses Clef\u2019s cheek, dabbing up the last of the tears before they can fall.</p>\n<p>Once Clef seems calm, Gears disposes of the paper towels and finds a safe place for the hat. He returns once again to Clef\u2019s side. After a moment of internal debate, Gears leans in, returning Clef\u2019s earlier gesture by locking their lips.</p>\n<p>It feels wrong. It feels good, but <em>horribly</em> wrong. Clef makes a soft noise, one Gears wouldn\u2019t mind hearing from him more, and makes no move to stop him. Still, he can\u2019t help but feel like he\u2019s violating Clef by doing this, as well as violating Kondraki\u2019s trust.</p>\n<p><em>Kondraki rushes into Gears\u2019s office. Gears sits at his desk, playing the role of someone hard at work. Kondraki slams the door shut behind him, sealing them in.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cDoctor Kondraki. You appear distressed. And injured.\u201d Gears stands up to examine the wound on Kondraki\u2019s shoulder.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cHa- ha yeah,\u201d Kondraki says, breathless, \u201cI scared Dmitri and Clef pretty good. Clef\u2019s probably not that far behind me.\u201d There\u2019s a pain in his voice, as the weight of what he\u2019s forced to leave behind hits him.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cI can work with this.\u201d Gears drags him over to the desk, bending him over so the blood from the shoulder wound drips onto the surface.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cSmart.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-408\">408</a> decloaks around him. Half of them split off, taking the form of Kondraki himself. Kondraki takes off his jacket, taking a moment to examine the hole in the shoulder where Clef\u2019s bullet tore through. There were a few dead butterflies clumped up in the fabric.</em></p>\n<p><em>Kondraki\u2019s stomach twists. \u201cYou know he\u2019ll see right through this.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cAs long as the overseers are satisfied it doesn\u2019t matter what he knows,\u201d Gears says, pulling a pistol out of his desk.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cHe\u2019ll hate me for it.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cI\u2019m afraid you'll have to live with it.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>Kondraki takes one last look at his jacket and hands it to his illusioned self. They put it on and have a seat at the desk. After examining them, Kondraki removes his hat and places it on the illusion\u2019s head.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cGoodbye my friends. And\u2026 goodbye Cog.\u201d Kondraki embraces Gears, squeezing him tight enough to force the air out of his lungs. Gears commits this feeling to memory.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cGoodbye\u2026 Doctor.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cPlease, make sure Draven stays safe. Get him out of here if you can. And Clef\u2026 oh God, Clef,\u201d he sucks in a shuddering sigh. \u201cTake care of him for me.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cYou should get going.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cRight.\u201d With the second half of 408 Kondraki cloaks and escapes through Gears\u2019s window. They won\u2019t survive long out on the run with him but he owes them everything for letting him make his escape at all.</em></p>\n<p><em>Gears closes the window and locks it, then, he looks to the false-Kondraki. Silently, he walks around the illusion, presses the gun to the back of their skull, and pulls the trigger. Even knowing it\u2019s fake, it\u2019s not a pleasant sight.</em></p>\n<p><em>By the time Clef makes it there the scene is perfect. Even if one could doubt Gears\u2019s word, they could never doubt Kondraki\u2019s ever cooling body.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201c\u2026Was it at least hard for you to do?\u201d Clef asks, sounding so very tired.</em></p>\n<p><em>Gears could answer that two ways. No, it wasn\u2019t hard to stage Kondraki\u2019s death, but it was agonizing to let him go.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u2026</em></p>\n<p>Gears holds the back of Clef\u2019s head, keeping him still. He drags his fingers down the back of his neck, along his collarbone, finally settling on Clef\u2019s shoulder. He runs his thumb over where the tear used to be, and where it seems Clef tried to patch it up.</p>\n<p>The kiss lasts for too long. By the time Gears pulls back, Clef is breathless, cheeks flushed. Clef babbles something; Gears catches the name <em>Ben</em> in there a couple times. Leaves a bitter taste in Gears\u2019s mouth. Fuck, Gears shouldn\u2019t have done that. <em>Fuck</em>, even if Clef wanted it Gears shouldn\u2019t have.</p>\n<p>Eyes closed, a thin stream of tears still trickling down his cheeks, lips partially open, Clef is more vulnerable in this moment than Gears has ever seen him before. He could do anything to Clef at this moment and no one, least of all Clef, would try to stop him.</p>\n<p>The thought <em>terrifies</em> him. He built his entire career, his very life, off of holding other people\u2019s lives in his hands, but it\u2019s never been so personal.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease\u2026\u201d Clef leans in, hands on Gears\u2019s hips. Gears grabs his wrists and pushes him back. Clef\u2019s eyes open, giving Gears a sad, pleading look.</p>\n<p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done that\u2026\u201d Gears shudders, a rock settling in his stomach. Knees popping, Gears stands and holds out a hand to help Clef do the same. Clef shakes, leaning on him for support.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re mean\u2026\u201d He says, pushing his face into Gears\u2019s ribs. Gears\u2019s shirt is soft and it smells nice. He draws in a deep breath through his nose and lets out a satisfied sigh.</p>\n<p>Gears shakes his head. \u201cYou should get to bed. You may use mine if you shower and change clothes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm-kay,\u201d he says into Gears\u2019s chest. Gears bites his lip, resisting the urge to shove Clef off. \u201cIt\u2019s hot in here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMay I suggest removing the jacket.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p>\n<p>Holding onto Clef, Gears leads him to the bathroom. He sits Clef on the toilet and helps him undress. As he attempts to strip Clef of his jacket Clef clings to it tighter. The muscles on his forehead tighten.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease cooperate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t take it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will return it to you. Do not make me use force.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef trembles, burying himself further in the jacket. He\u2019s tempted to rip it off him, but that would only make Clef more uncooperative.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlto,\u201d voice flat and firm, Gears grabs his attention. \u201cI will return the jacket, but you <em>must</em> remove it for the time being. Do you understand me?\u201d He does his best to keep his tone consistent, hoping that if Clef couldn\u2019t understand his words he would at least understand his point.</p>\n<p>The effect seems to work, Clef drops his shoulders and allows Gears to take it. Gears lays it out over the sink and begins undoing Clef\u2019s shirt buttons, careful to keep his fingers out of the mess. Clef leans back, resting the back of his head against the toilet tank.</p>\n<p>\u201cI assume you can handle yourself?\u201d Gears asks when he\u2019s finished stripping Clef. He gathers Clef\u2019s clothes, leaving his jacket, and allows Clef his privacy.</p>\n<p>While he waits he has a nightly routine to tend to. Change clothes, start the laundry, check every door and window, lock them if necessary, turn every light off\u2026 It\u2019s always been a comfort to him.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>Gears stops in his tracks. He turns to face Iceberg.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen me do this before, have you not?\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Gears hunches over the kitchen sink and retches. There\u2019s nothing in his stomach to throw up but that doesn\u2019t stop his body from trying. It hadn\u2019t occurred to him until now, but he hasn\u2019t allowed another person into his home since Iceberg\u2026</p>\n<p>Since he\u2026</p>\n<p>Augh, the taste of stomach acid is vile. He waits outside the bathroom, arms crossed, leaning up against the wall, to brush his teeth\u2026 He doesn\u2019t hear the shower going. He can\u2019t hear anything inside.</p>\n<p>Nothing could have happened in the short time Gears spent surveying the <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span>. Clef may have been drunk but there\u2019s no way he would have fallen or drowned or tripped or <em>done something to hurt himse-</em></p>\n<p>Hard enough to rattle the <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span>, Gears slams the door open and sees <em>Iceberg\u2019s cold body lying motionless on the f-</em> Clef standing before the mirror, towel around his waist, holding his jacket.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe fuck-!\u201d Clef jumps, catching himself on the sink. He hugs the jacket to his chest, giving Gears a nervous look.</p>\n<p>Hand over his heart, Gears can feel his pulse racing. Of course, <em>of course,</em> he had no reason to be afraid. He swallows, brushes the sweat off his brow, and reaches past Clef for the cabinet. He offers Clef an unused toothbrush and takes up his own.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter\u2026\u201d He looks better at the very least, his face and eyes aren\u2019t so red, and Gears isn\u2019t as worried about him collapsing.</p>\n<p>Gears checks <em>brush teeth</em> off his mental checklist.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to sleep in?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you usually sleep in?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy underwear.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will provide clean boxers for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a struggle to find anything in Gears\u2019s closet that fits Clef\u2019s body-type, but he manages to scrounge up a pair of underwear. Clef insists on wearing his jacket. There\u2019s any number of disgusting things clinging to that old rag, but Gears finds no point in fighting him for it now.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t think about how Iceberg\u2019s scarf rests in his closet. <em>He doesn\u2019t want to think about how many nights he slept with it in his bed.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cThis is my bedroom.\u201d He makes a sweeping gesture around the tidy room. \u201cYou will sleep here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am perfectly content on the couch.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef frowns, that sad, wet look returning to his eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to stay with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to make you uncomfortable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d be more comfortable with you here.\u201d Clef lays in the bed. Gears stands at the foot of the bed for several moments before he crawls into bed beside him. Clef wriggles closer until they\u2019re chest to chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cGoodnight, Dr. Clef.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t we going to do anything?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are going to sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut don\u2019t you want to?\u201d Clef reaches under Gears\u2019s shirt and runs his palm down his chest.</p>\n<p>Gears pulls Clef\u2019s hand out. \u201cYou\u2019re drunk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m nottttt drunk! I <em>feel</em> sober! I know what I want!\u201d He wraps his legs around one of Gears\u2019s, trying to jam himself even closer. \u201cI want you to make me stop thinking. Don\u2019t you want me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat I want is inconsequential. You are drunk and I will not be sleeping with you.\u201d Pulling himself out of Clef\u2019s grasp, Gears flips over. He wants to scream and he might do so if Clef keeps squirming.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 come back?\u201d His voice cracks. A dull pain shoots through Gears\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou will be quiet or I will sleep alone,\u201d Gears says before turning back over.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine, asshole\u2026\u201d Clef presses his face into Gears\u2019s chest. Gears winces when he feels tears soak into his shirt.</p>\n<p>Eventually Clef falls asleep. Gears lies there, staring up at the ceiling. It\u2019s nice\u2026 having something warm in his bed. It\u2019s been so long since he\u2019s held or been held.</p>\n<p>When he closes his eyes he sees Iceberg. His stomach twists, a pressure growing in his chest. There\u2019s no way for him to pretend that it\u2019s Iceberg beside him. <em>What has he done to earn the right to lie with someone else?</em> The vision of Iceberg questions.</p>\n<p>Sleep never comes for him.</p>\n<p>Clef wakes up alone. The room is dark and comfortable but terribly empty. There\u2019s a glass of water, two pills, and a note on the table. He doesn\u2019t need to read the note to know what it says. Downing both pills, he wraps himself back in the blankets, returning to his restless oblivion.</p>\n<div class=\"series-nav\">\n<p>\u00ab <strong>Part 1</strong> <em>(you are here)</em> | <strong><a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/i-need-you-to-leave\">Part 2</a></strong> | <strong><a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/this-is-not-a-place-of-honor\">Part 3</a></strong> | <strong><a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/nobody-runs-site-19\">Part 4</a></strong> | <strong><a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/tomorrow-and-tomorrow-and-tomorrow\">Finale</a></strong> \u00bb</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/lets-get-you-home\">Okay, That's Enough, Let's Get You Home</a>\" by kingofmice, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Over the past couple of weeks he\u2019s become quite acquainted with several of them. Apparently it just wasn\u2019t enough for Clef to frequent one hole in the wall bar. \n\n\n\nAt least once Gears mapped out every place Clef could be it was only a matter of process of elimination. Clef\u2019s truck sticks out like a sore thumb anywhere, especially the desolate parking lot of //The Bitter End//. \n\n\n\nTwenty minutes ago the last few bar goers stumbled out. The neon sign outside reads **CLOSED**, but through the tinted windows Gears can make out one single straggler.\n\n\n\n\u00a0The door creaks as he enters and does not open all the way, forcing him to wriggle his way in. A lone, flickering, amber light illuminates the center of the bar, leaving the filthy sides obscured in darkness. Walking in, he finds the floor sticky, his well-kept shoes squelch against the floor. \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s certainly not a place Gears would have ever //willingly// entered. The only two inhabitants are a very exhausted looking barkeep and a very drunk looking Clef. It\u2019s sweltering and yet Clef is bundled up in a ratty, brown jacket. The barkeep\u2019s eyes are void of any emotion. \n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re closed?\u201d he says, wearily. As Gears gets closer to the bar, the thick, burning smell of vomit gets stronger, making his nose scrunch up involuntarily. \n\n\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d he says, voice flat. \u201cI am here to take my associate home.\u201d He puts a firm hand on Clef's shoulder, grasping it firmly. Clef flinches, nearly falling out of his chair. \n\n\n\nClef looks over his shoulder quickly, swinging his hat into his face. He burps and blows a wet raspberry at Gears. \u201cCoggyyyyy baby, get the fuuuuck outta here.\u201d His words are slurred and Gears doesn\u2019t recognize the accent Clef is putting on. \n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s not acceptable.\u201d Gears wraps an arm around Clef\u2019s shoulders so he doesn\u2019t slip. Clef groans, flopping against Gears\u2019s torso. He hic-ups, prompting a wave of drunken giggles. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019//rrrrre// not acceptable,\u201d Clef says, breathless.\n\n\n\n\u201cHow much has he had to drink?\u201d Gears asks, turning his attention to the barkeep. \n\n\n\nWithout a word, the barkeep slides a bill over the countertop. Gears\u2019s eye twitches as he glances over it. How Clef hasn\u2019t drunk himself into a coma speaks volumes to either Clef\u2019s tolerance or the alcohol quality this bar provides. \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cOh- uh- Johnathan Tucker.\u201d Johnathan points to his illegible nametag. \n\n\n\nKeeping one hand on Clef, Gears pulls out his checkbook and fills out two sheets, one to cover Clef\u2019s binge and the other to personally compensate for Johnathan\u2019s time. Johnathan examines them, a withered smile pulling on his lips. \n\n\n\n\u201cHave a good night, sir!\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cGoodnight.\u201d Gears hoists Clef to his feet, fully prepared to drag Clef across the floor if need be; Clef ragdolls, apparently hellbent on being as unhelpful as possible. \n\n\n\n\u201cThis is kidnapping!\u201d Clef spits, \u201cYou\u2019re letting this guy kidnap me!\u201d He points an accusatory finger in the general direction of the bar. He writhes, ineffectively pawing at Gears\u2019s arms. \n\n\n\n\u201cHave some maturity,\u201d Gears says, bordering on a growl. It was enough struggle trying to lug Clef\u2019s weight across the sticky ground //without// Clef actively fighting him. \n\n\n\nThe crisp night air burns Clef\u2019s flushed face. He whines, letting drool run down his chin. Gears drags Clef to his car, dropping him off on the pavement. He pops open the passenger\u2019s side door. \n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m taking you home.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t wannnnaaaaaa go home!\u201d Clef says with the cadence of a small child. \n\n\n\n\u201cThen we will go to //my// home. Either way you\u2019re not staying here.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cBooooo!\u201d Arms crossed, Clef sticks his tongue out and blows another raspberry. \n\n\n\nThis is exhausting. After all the effort Gears took to find Clef and ensure his safety, he believes he\u2019s owed a little more //gratitude//. Perhaps he expected too much from his coworker. \n\n\n\n\u201cCan you stand up?\u201d \n\n\n\nClef grunts, making several attempts to sit up only to flop back down. He looks stupefied, like nothing could possibly explain his struggle. Gears sighs, getting down to haul Clef up again. \n\n\n\nHe drags Clef towards the seat and pushes him in. He\u2019s stopped by Clef\u2019s hands shooting out and bracing against the roof of the car. Gears bares his teeth, putting his weight onto him. \n\n\n\n\u201c//Clef-\u201d//\n\n\n\n//\u201cWait-!\u201d// Is all the warning Gears gets before Clef lurches forward, spewing his stomach onto Gears\u2019s leather seat. Gears roils.\n\n\n\nClef spits, taking an uneasy step back. He holds onto the car, swaying like a branch. Vomit runs down his chin, clots in his facial hair, and drips onto his shirt. He rubs his face against his sleeve, smearing the bile further. \n\n\n\n\u201c//Sorrrry//,\u201d he mumbles, blowing a spit bubble. \n\n\n\nGears stares at the ruined seat with contempt. He sucks in a deep breath through his teeth, determined not to lose his cool. He nudges past Clef, leaning over the vomit splatter for the paper towels he always keeps in there. \n\n\n\nHe does his best to wipe down the seat and Clef\u2019s face. Clef can only offer a blank expression as Gears cleans him up. He tosses the soiled paper towels into a plastic bag and tries very hard not to think about it. \n\n\n\n\u201cDo you feel like vomiting again?\u201d Gears asks, voice calm, like he\u2019s talking to a child. \n\n\n\n\u201cHuh\u2026?\u201d \n\n\n\nGears puts his head in his hands. \u201cPlease get in the back seat.\u201d \n\n\n\nHe shuts the passenger\u2019s side door, cracking open the back. Clef mumbles something, haphazardly flopping facefirst into the clean cushions. Gears reaches in and grabs a handful of Clef\u2019s hair, using that to force him upright. \n\n\n\n\u201cOkay! Okay! I\u2019m up!\u201d Clef whines, getting in the correct position. Gears crawls into his lap and buckles him in. Clef flushes, turning his head to the side. \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat ab-bout my truck?\u201d He waves a hand towards the truck in question. \n\n\n\n\u201cI will handle it.\u201d \n\n\n\nThe drive is quiet, which Gears can only be thankful for. It\u2019s a struggle to keep his eyes open but the burning stench of vomit certainly keeps him from getting too relaxed. \n\n\n\nAs the drive goes on he gets a crawling feeling down his back. //He swears he sees a figure in the passenger\u2019s seat. He\u2019s scared to look, fearing he might turn to see Iceberg rotting beside him.//\n\n\n\nThey pull up to a large [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]], within walking distance of Site-19 and well away from anything that could be called a //community//. The only light is a single flickering street lamp. Clef groans, sits up, and squints at the building, not immediately recognizing it. \n\n\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t my [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]]?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course, this is my [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]]. You will come inside.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cIs that an order, //sir//?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI would rather it not be.\u201d \n\n\n\nTaking him by the forearm, Gears leads him inside. The [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]] is dark and smells new, unlived in. Everything is unsettlingly clean. The furniture stands perfectly uniform and colorless. It\u2019s like he just walked into an air-freshened prison cell. \n\n\n\nThere\u2019s an island between the kitchen and, what appears to be, the dining room. The white countertops look so clean that Clef thinks even a single grain of coke would stick out on its surface. Gears sits Clef at the table and fetches a glass of water. \n\n\n\nAs Gears returns to Clef\u2019s side he holds the glass out as an offering. Clef crosses his arms and sticks his nose up.\n\n\n\n\u201cClef\u2026\u201d Gears says, patiently. \u201cPlease drink.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cNuh-uh.\u201d Clef bites the inside of his lips, turning his head to the side as Gears continually tries to bring it up to them. \n\n\n\n\u201cAlto.\u201d Gears puts a firm hand on Clef\u2019s shoulder. \n\n\n\nClef opens his eyes, not realizing he closed them, and he finds himself not in Gears\u2019s home but //in an empty staff room at Site-19. He\u2019s not alone here, Kondraki stands beside him, leaning nonchalantly against the wall.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//They\u2019re close, too close, but in the tension of the moment Clef couldn\u2019t care less. Kondraki looks at him, eyes filled with\u2026 if Clef didn\u2019t know any better he would tell himself Kondraki was looking at him with affection.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not thirsty?\u201d he asks, waving his beer bottle in Clef\u2019s face. Clef gawks at him, half tempted to smack the bottle out of his hands.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cNo. I don\u2019t see how you drink that shit. It doesn\u2019t even have that much alcohol in it.\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//Kondraki shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad once you get used to it.\u201d// \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0//\u201cYeah, drinking acid isn\u2019t that bad either once you burn your tastebuds off.\u201d// \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//It wasn\u2019t that funny but Kondraki chuckles and Clef can\u2019t help but chuckle too. Kondraki leans in, looming over him, cheeks warm with alcohol and joy. He looks Clef in the eyes and for a moment Clef is captivated.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0//Kondraki smirks, taking one long swig of his drink. He proceeds to push Clef up against the wall, pinning him there with his body. Heart hammering in his chest, Clef looks up, eyes wide.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n//The world stops.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//The next thing he knows, Kondraki has his lips pressed against Clef\u2019s. Clef sinks into the feeling, practically going limp, moaning ever so softly. Then he feels the sting of carbonation and his shoulders tense. Kondraki\u2019s grip on him is strong, Clef can\u2019t spit it out.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//He swallows Kondraki\u2019s disgusting beer, feeling all the worse for it. Kondraki pulls back, that stupid grin plastered on his face. He licks his lips slowly, like he\u2019s mocking him.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//Wiping his face with the back of his wrist, Clef says, \u201cThat was the most disgusting thing you\u2019ve ever done to me.\u201d He pauses, looking Kondraki in the eyes. \u201c... You wanna do it again?\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\nClef\u2019s shoulders slouch. His eyes droop, not looking at Gears but locked onto something in the distance. The feisty energy visibly drains from his features. Gears takes advantage of the moment and has him drain the glass.\n\n\n\n\u201cNow\u2026 Was that so hard?\u201d Gears asks, setting the cup on the island. \n\n\n\nClef turns to face him, quivering weakly, eyes wet with tears. Gears frowns and lets out a heavy sigh. He brushes the hair out of Clef\u2019s face and cups his cheek, feeling the warmth in his palm. \n\n\n\nClef\u2019s hands shoot out, snatching either side of Gears\u2019s face. Gears fails to brace himself, barely managing to catch him on Clef\u2019s chair. Their lips jam together in an approximation of a kiss. \n\n\n\nGears would be lying if he said he found the sensation unpleasant, but he will say so anyway. Clef\u2019s lips are chapped, the kiss is far too wet and sloppy, not to mention the taste of vomit. \n\n\n\nAnd yet\u2026 Gears can\u2019t bring himself to pull away, not immediately. There\u2019s a certain desperation to how Clef clings to him, how his fingers paw and scrunch up in his shirt and hair, the soft, needy noises he makes. It draws Gears in and leaves him entranced.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, this was unacceptable. He pulls back, straining out of Clef\u2019s persistent grasp. Clef mouths against his collar. Biting the inside of his lip, Gears yanks Clef\u2019s head back by his hair. He prays the warmth in his cheeks isn\u2019t visible. \n\n\n\n\u201cOuch!\u201d Cries Clef. \u201cDon\u2019t you like me?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re inebriated,\u201d he says through gritted teeth, \u201cYou\u2019ll thank me in the morning.\u201d \n\n\n\nClef scoffs. \u201cGuh, //fuck you//. You could have //pussy// just //lined// up before you and you\u2019d still be a virgin.\u201d \n\n\n\nGears shakes his head. He turns and walks into the kitchen, taking Clef\u2019s cup with him. This was just another one of Clef\u2019s tantrums. He turns on the sink, letting the cold water run over the glass. Anything to occupy his hands so he doesn\u2019t wring Clef\u2019s neck. \n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ignore me! Why won\u2019t you touch me?\u201d Clef drags himself out of the chair, leaning on the counter. \n\n\n\n\u201cI have stated my reasons.\u201d Gears turns the water up, hoping to drown him out. \n\n\n\n\u201cBullshh//hittttttttt//. Don\u2019t act like you\u2019ve never [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/this-world-is-as-you-would-have-wanted taken advantage of someone before].\u201d \n\n\n\nThe sink shuts off with a thunk. Gears glares at his reflection in the glass, hating the man looking back at him. He attempts to swallow a lump in his throat; his mouth runs dry. \n\n\n\n\u201c... what do you mean by that?\u201d \n\n\n\nWith his back to Clef he can\u2019t see his expression, but he can hear the sinister grin in Clef\u2019s next words. \n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be coy with me, Coggy. Trying to hide all the shit you were doing to Iceberg. You\u2019re a little //freak// aren\u2019t you? [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/in-his-own-image-part-3 |Bet that\u2019s why he shot himself]]].\u201d \n\n\n\nThe glass clangs against the bottom of the sink. A shot of adrenaline shoots through Clef\u2019s veins. He stumbles over the chair, backing himself into a wall as Gears stares him down, marching towards him with purpose. \n\n\n\nClef opens his mouth, maybe to beg for mercy, maybe to scream. Whatever noise he wanted to make is cut off as Gears wraps his hand around his throat. It\u2019s not tight enough to block airflow, no, Gears is very precise about that. He pins Clef to the wall in a position that\u2019s oh so familiar and //oh so terrifying//. \n\n\n\nClef wheezes, on the verge of hyperventilating. Gears can feel his speedy heartbeat under his fingers. It\u2019s refreshing, the scared look on Clef\u2019s face, how he uselessly worms about and claws at Gears\u2019s fingers. Tears and snot run down his crimson face.\n\n\n\n\u201cBreathe,\u201d Gears commands, keeping up the illusion of self control. \u201cI do not wish to hurt you, and I will not if you do not give me reason to. It would do you some good to //never// mention Dr. Iceberg to me again. Understood?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cMmm-mhm!\u201d Clef tries his best to nod. He feels Clef\u2019s Adam's apple bob under his palm. Satisfied, and not wanting Clef\u2019s snot to drip onto his sleeve, Gears releases him. \n\n\n\nOnce free, Clef crumbles onto the floor and hugs his knees to his chest. He struggles to breathe, each sharp gasp only burns. He sounds awful, raspy, like he\u2019s having an asthma attack. Gears turns his back to him, about to return to the kitchen. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou took everything from me\u2026 Why won\u2019t you just finish me off?\u201d \n\n\n\nGears stills, feeling a heavy weight on his shoulders. He shakes his head and continues on. The glass is dried and returned to its place in the cupboard. While there, he fetches a roll of paper towels for Clef. \n\n\n\nHe kneels down to Clef\u2019s level, cleaning off Clef\u2019s face for the second time. Clef sobs, choking on his own spit. Gears remains patient, finding something uncomfortably\u2026//familiar// in the position he\u2019s in.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy did he leave me?\u201d Clef mumbles, reaching up to grasp Gears\u2019s wrist. Gears\u2019s breath hitches. \n\n\n\nHe combs his knuckles through Clef\u2019s hair, trying to soothe him. His trembles slow and his breathing settles. He pauses in his motions, taking a moment to glance around his empty home. He believes he has privacy and safety here, but he never wanted to be careless. Not when a dear friend is on the line. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou know why he had to leave,\u201d Gears says, breath soft and warm against Clef\u2019s neck. Clef shivers, hair standing on him. \n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair!\u201d He hunches forward, face in his hands, and dissolves into another fit of sobs. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have protected him?\u201d \n\n\n\nPushing Clef flat against the wall, Gears jams the wad of paper towel over his mouth. \u201cI //did// protect him. Can\u2019t you understand? He was only in danger here.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy couldn't he have taken me with him?\u201d Clef asks, shaky hands reaching up to grip the front of Gears\u2019s shirt. His eyes are empty. \n\n\n\n\u201cBecause-\u201d Gears pries Clef\u2019s fingers off him, \u201c-he would have been safer without you. There [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-king-is-dead |was a warrant for his execution]]]. If you had disappeared alongside him you would have put //everyone// at risk.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Clef says, going slack. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI know\u2026\u201d Gears reaches out and plucks off Clef\u2019s hat. He caresses Clef\u2019s cheek, dabbing up the last of the tears before they can fall. \n\n\n\nOnce Clef seems calm, Gears disposes of the paper towels and finds a safe place for the hat. He returns once again to Clef\u2019s side. After a moment of internal debate, Gears leans in, returning Clef\u2019s earlier gesture by locking their lips. \n\n\n\nIt feels wrong. It feels good, but //horribly// wrong. Clef makes a soft noise, one Gears wouldn\u2019t mind hearing from him more, and makes no move to stop him. Still, he can\u2019t help but feel like he\u2019s violating Clef by doing this, as well as violating Kondraki\u2019s trust.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//Kondraki rushes into Gears\u2019s office. Gears sits at his desk, playing the role of someone hard at work. Kondraki slams the door shut behind him, sealing them in.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cDoctor Kondraki. You appear distressed. And injured.\u201d Gears stands up to examine the wound on Kondraki\u2019s shoulder.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0//\u201cHa- ha yeah,\u201d Kondraki says, breathless, \u201cI scared Dmitri and Clef pretty good. Clef\u2019s probably not that far behind me.\u201d There\u2019s a pain in his voice, as the weight of what he\u2019s forced to leave behind hits him.// \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0//\u201cI can work with this.\u201d Gears drags him over to the desk, bending him over so the blood from the shoulder wound drips onto the surface.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n//\u201cSmart.\u201d// \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-408 |408]]] decloaks around him. Half of them split off, taking the form of Kondraki himself. Kondraki takes off his jacket, taking a moment to examine the hole in the shoulder where Clef\u2019s bullet tore through. There were a few dead butterflies clumped up in the fabric.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n//Kondraki\u2019s stomach twists. \u201cYou know he\u2019ll see right through this.\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n//\u201cAs long as the overseers are satisfied it doesn\u2019t matter what he knows,\u201d Gears says, pulling a pistol out of his desk.// \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cHe\u2019ll hate me for it.\u201d// \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0//\u201cI\u2019m afraid you'll have to live with it.\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n//Kondraki takes one last look at his jacket and hands it to his illusioned self. They put it on and have a seat at the desk. After examining them, Kondraki removes his hat and places it on the illusion\u2019s head.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cGoodbye my friends. And\u2026 goodbye Cog.\u201d Kondraki embraces Gears, squeezing him tight enough to force the air out of his lungs. Gears commits this feeling to memory.// \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cGoodbye\u2026 Doctor.\u201d// \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cPlease, make sure Draven stays safe. Get him out of here if you can. And Clef\u2026 oh God, Clef,\u201d he sucks in a shuddering sigh. \u201cTake care of him for me.\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cYou should get going.\u201d// \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cRight.\u201d With the second half of 408 Kondraki cloaks and escapes through Gears\u2019s window. They won\u2019t survive long out on the run with him but he owes them everything for letting him make his escape at all.// \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//Gears closes the window and locks it, then, he looks to the false-Kondraki. Silently, he walks around the illusion, presses the gun to the back of their skull, and pulls the trigger. Even knowing it\u2019s fake, it\u2019s not a pleasant sight.// \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0//By the time Clef makes it there the scene is perfect. Even if one could doubt Gears\u2019s word, they could never doubt Kondraki\u2019s ever cooling body.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201c\u2026Was it at least hard for you to do?\u201d Clef asks, sounding so very tired.// \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//Gears could answer that two ways. No, it wasn\u2019t hard to stage Kondraki\u2019s death, but it was agonizing to let him go.// \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0//\u2026//\n\n\n\n\n\nGears holds the back of Clef\u2019s head, keeping him still. He drags his fingers down the back of his neck, along his collarbone, finally settling on Clef\u2019s shoulder. He runs his thumb over where the tear used to be, and where it seems Clef tried to patch it up. \n\n\n\nThe kiss lasts for too long. By the time Gears pulls back, Clef is breathless, cheeks flushed. Clef babbles something; Gears catches the name //Ben// in there a couple times. Leaves a bitter taste in Gears\u2019s mouth. Fuck, Gears shouldn\u2019t have done that. //Fuck//, even if Clef wanted it Gears shouldn\u2019t have.\n\n\n\nEyes closed, a thin stream of tears still trickling down his cheeks, lips partially open, Clef is more vulnerable in this moment than Gears has ever seen him before. He could do anything to Clef at this moment and no one, least of all Clef, would try to stop him. \n\n\n\nThe thought //terrifies// him. He built his entire career, his very life, off of holding other people\u2019s lives in his hands, but it\u2019s never been so personal. \n\n\n\n\u201cPlease\u2026\u201d Clef leans in, hands on Gears\u2019s hips. Gears grabs his wrists and pushes him back. Clef\u2019s eyes open, giving Gears a sad, pleading look. \n\n\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done that\u2026\u201d Gears shudders, a rock settling in his stomach. Knees popping, Gears stands and holds out a hand to help Clef do the same. Clef shakes, leaning on him for support. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re mean\u2026\u201d He says, pushing his face into Gears\u2019s ribs. Gears\u2019s shirt is soft and it smells nice. He draws in a deep breath through his nose and lets out a satisfied sigh. \n\n\n\nGears shakes his head. \u201cYou should get to bed. You may use mine if you shower and change clothes.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cMmm-kay,\u201d he says into Gears\u2019s chest. Gears bites his lip, resisting the urge to shove Clef off. \u201cIt\u2019s hot in here.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cMay I suggest removing the jacket.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cEh?\u201d \n\n\n\nHolding onto Clef, Gears leads him to the bathroom. He sits Clef on the toilet and helps him undress. As he attempts to strip Clef of his jacket Clef clings to it tighter. The muscles on his forehead tighten. \n\n\n\n\u201cPlease cooperate.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t take it.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI will return it to you. Do not make me use force.\u201d \n\n\n\nClef trembles, burying himself further in the jacket. He\u2019s tempted to rip it off him, but that would only make Clef more uncooperative. \n\n\n\n\u201cAlto,\u201d voice flat and firm, Gears grabs his attention. \u201cI will return the jacket, but you //must// remove it for the time being. Do you understand me?\u201d He does his best to keep his tone consistent, hoping that if Clef couldn\u2019t understand his words he would at least understand his point. \n\n\n\nThe effect seems to work, Clef drops his shoulders and allows Gears to take it. Gears lays it out over the sink and begins undoing Clef\u2019s shirt buttons, careful to keep his fingers out of the mess. Clef leans back, resting the back of his head against the toilet tank. \n\n\n\n\u201cI assume you can handle yourself?\u201d Gears asks when he\u2019s finished stripping Clef. He gathers Clef\u2019s clothes, leaving his jacket, and allows Clef his privacy. \n\n\n\nWhile he waits he has a nightly routine to tend to. Change clothes, start the laundry, check every door and window, lock them if necessary, turn every light off\u2026 It\u2019s always been a comfort to him. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//Gears stops in his tracks. He turns to face Iceberg.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cYou\u2019ve seen me do this before, have you not?\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0//\u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\nGears hunches over the kitchen sink and retches. There\u2019s nothing in his stomach to throw up but that doesn\u2019t stop his body from trying. It hadn\u2019t occurred to him until now, but he hasn\u2019t allowed another person into his home since Iceberg\u2026\n\n\n\nSince he\u2026\n\n\n\nAugh, the taste of stomach acid is vile. He waits outside the bathroom, arms crossed, leaning up against the wall, to brush his teeth\u2026 He doesn\u2019t hear the shower going. He can\u2019t hear anything inside.\n\n\n\nNothing could have happened in the short time Gears spent surveying the [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]]. Clef may have been drunk but there\u2019s no way he would have fallen or drowned or tripped or //done something to hurt himse-//\n\n\n\nHard enough to rattle the [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]], Gears slams the door open and sees //Iceberg\u2019s cold body lying motionless on the f-// Clef standing before the mirror, towel around his waist, holding his jacket. \n\n\n\n\u201cThe fuck-!\u201d Clef jumps, catching himself on the sink. He hugs the jacket to his chest, giving Gears a nervous look. \n\n\n\nHand over his heart, Gears can feel his pulse racing. Of course, //of course,// he had no reason to be afraid. He swallows, brushes the sweat off his brow, and reaches past Clef for the cabinet. He offers Clef an unused toothbrush and takes up his own. \n\n\n\n\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cBetter\u2026\u201d He looks better at the very least, his face and eyes aren\u2019t so red, and Gears isn\u2019t as worried about him collapsing. \n\n\n\nGears checks //brush teeth// off his mental checklist. \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat am I supposed to sleep in?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you usually sleep in?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cMy underwear.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI will provide clean boxers for you.\u201d \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a struggle to find anything in Gears\u2019s closet that fits Clef\u2019s body-type, but he manages to scrounge up a pair of underwear. Clef insists on wearing his jacket. There\u2019s any number of disgusting things clinging to that old rag, but Gears finds no point in fighting him for it now. \n\n\n\nHe doesn\u2019t think about how Iceberg\u2019s scarf rests in his closet. //He doesn\u2019t want to think about how many nights he slept with it in his bed.//\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is my bedroom.\u201d He makes a sweeping gesture around the tidy room. \u201cYou will sleep here.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat about you?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI am perfectly content on the couch.\u201d \n\n\n\nClef frowns, that sad, wet look returning to his eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to stay with me?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to make you uncomfortable.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be more comfortable with you here.\u201d Clef lays in the bed. Gears stands at the foot of the bed for several moments before he crawls into bed beside him. Clef wriggles closer until they\u2019re chest to chest. \n\n\n\n\u201cGoodnight, Dr. Clef.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t we going to do anything?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cWe are going to sleep.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cBut don\u2019t you want to?\u201d Clef reaches under Gears\u2019s shirt and runs his palm down his chest. \n\n\n\nGears pulls Clef\u2019s hand out. \u201cYou\u2019re drunk.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m nottttt drunk! I //feel// sober! I know what I want!\u201d He wraps his legs around one of Gears\u2019s, trying to jam himself even closer. \u201cI want you to make me stop thinking. Don\u2019t you want me?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat I want is inconsequential. You are drunk and I will not be sleeping with you.\u201d Pulling himself out of Clef\u2019s grasp, Gears flips over. He wants to scream and he might do so if Clef keeps squirming. \n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 come back?\u201d His voice cracks. A dull pain shoots through Gears\u2019s chest. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou will be quiet or I will sleep alone,\u201d Gears says before turning back over.\n\n\n\n\u201cFine, asshole...\u201d Clef presses his face into Gears\u2019s chest. Gears winces when he feels tears soak into his shirt. \n\n\n\nEventually Clef falls asleep. Gears lies there, staring up at the ceiling. It\u2019s nice\u2026 having something warm in his bed. It\u2019s been so long since he\u2019s held or been held. \n\n\n\nWhen he closes his eyes he sees Iceberg. His stomach twists, a pressure growing in his chest. There\u2019s no way for him to pretend that it\u2019s Iceberg beside him. //What has he done to earn the right to lie with someone else?// The vision of Iceberg questions. \n\n\n\nSleep never comes for him.\n\n\n\nClef wakes up alone. The room is dark and comfortable but terribly empty. There\u2019s a glass of water, two pills, and a note on the table. He doesn\u2019t need to read the note to know what it says. Downing both pills, he wraps himself back in the blankets, returning to his restless oblivion.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"series-nav\"]]\n\n\u00ab **Part 1** //(you are here)// | **[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/i-need-you-to-leave Part 2]**\u00a0\u00a0| **[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/this-is-not-a-place-of-honor Part 3]**\u00a0\u00a0| **[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/nobody-runs-site-19 Part 4]**\u00a0\u00a0| **[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/tomorrow-and-tomorrow-and-tomorrow Finale]** \u00bb\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["this-world-is-as-you-would-have-wanted", "in-his-own-image-part-3", "the-king-is-dead", "scp-408", "i-need-you-to-leave", "this-is-not-a-place-of-honor", "nobody-runs-site-19", "tomorrow-and-tomorrow-and-tomorrow", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "bleak", "doctor-clef", "doctor-gears", "doctor-iceberg", "doctor-kondraki", "tale"], "title": "Okay, That's Enough, Let's Get You Home - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/lets-get-you-home", "year": 2024}, "merry-christmas-jude-kriyot": {"created_at": "2024-01-01T14:30:00", "creator": "Uncle Nicolini", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Uncle Nicolini", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/uncle-nicolini", "comment": "", "date": "2024-01-01T14:30:00"}, {"author": "Uncle Nicolini", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/uncle-nicolini", "comment": "Added tags: art-exchange, esther-kogan, faeowynn-wilson, gamers-against-weed, heartwarming, jockjamsvol6, jude-kriyot, lgbtq, slice-of-life.

The lights were off and the ceiling fan directly above spun about halfheartedly. The pungent smell of weed filled the air, alongside the stench of various bags of trash Jude had neglected to take out over the course of the month. A single blunt was clutched between the fingers on his left hand and a lighter was palmed in his right. Jude hadn't found the energy to light it yet.</p>\n<div class=\"outside\">\n<p>\"Merry Christmas, <span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\">Blondie</span>! Don't you look darling in your little dress!\"</p>\n<p>Aunt Janie entered the living room where she and her cousins were playing Smash Brothers on a Nintendo 64. She leaned over and pinched <span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\">the girl</span>'s cheeks. \"You're growing into a beautiful woman! You look so much like your mother, she must be so proud of you.\"</p>\n<p><span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\">The girl</span> forced a smile. She fidgeted in her dress. It felt like a prison. At least while she was playing video games she could escape into them. She liked playing Link because he was handsome. Her cousins teased her that she had a crush on him, but <span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\">the girl</span> wasn't sure if that was what it was. \"Thanks, Aunt Janie,\" she grimaced, then turned her attention back to the ongoing match between two of her older cousins.</p>\n<p>\"Were you a good girl this year, <span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\">Blondie</span>?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes.\" She could feel bugs crawling under her skin. She could feel her palms tingling. She could feel her eye twitching.</p>\n<p>\"And what did you ask Santa for this year? A Barbie?\"</p>\n<p>\"No. I asked for a Transformer. And a Nintendo 64 with Smash Brothers so I can play at my house.\"</p>\n<p>\"A Transformer? You're a silly girl, that's a boy's toy.\"</p>\n<p>The Nintendo 64 suddenly malfunctioned and flicked off, much to the annoyance of the boys playing.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Suddenly, a ping.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: orange\">jockjamsvol6:</span></strong> Hey jude sorry to bother you on christmas but i sent you a present!!<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"color: orange\">jockjamsvol6:</span></strong> Go get it, I just got the notification that it arrived right now.<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"color: orange\">jockjamsvol6:</span></strong> And don't forget to call me, i want to hear your reaction to it!!</p>\n</div>\n<p>He sighed. What was the point of getting up? Besides, it was snowing out and he didn't want to get dressed, walk down the apartment building's stairs, find his mailbox key, just to go grab something that was probably stupid from JJ. It would be there tomorrow. He could grab it then. Preferably when it wasn't snowing.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: green\">bluntfiend:</span></strong> I'm not feeling well right now.<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"color: green\">bluntfiend:</span></strong> Maybe later.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Tossing his phone on the bed, Jude then picked up his lighter again and flicked it on, attempting to light his blunt with it.</p>\n<div class=\"outside\">\n<p><span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\">The girl</span> and her family sat gathered around a fully lit and decorated Christmas tree. Ornaments, lights, garlands, the works. Her mother fussed with a video camera, trying to get it on properly while her father sat on his recliner sipping on coffee.</p>\n<p>\"Alright, <span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\">Blondie</span>! Go ahead and start opening gifts!\" Her mother smiled, pointing the camera at <span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\">the girl</span>.</p>\n<p><span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\">The girl</span> excitedly began to tear open the paper wrapping the nearest gift. Moments later, she held up a blue church dress. <span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\">The girl</span> bit her lip, then set it aside. On to the next present. Again, she opened this one quickly, only to reveal a pink box containing a Barbie. <span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\">The girl</span> put the Barbie down and took a deep breath.</p>\n<p>\"Do you like it? She's President Barbie!\" Her mom beamed from behind the camera as the lights on the Christmas tree flickered until they shut off entirely.</p>\n<p>\"I wanted a Transformer\u2026\" <span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\">Blondie</span> choked, tears streaming down her cheeks. \"Was I not good enough for Santa?\"</p>\n</div>\n<p>Another ping.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: orange\">jockjamsvol6:</span></strong> I'll send you a shirtless pic if you do<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"color: orange\">jockjamsvol6:</span></strong> ;)</p>\n</div>\n<p>Jude blushed at this. He dropped his blunt on his thigh, nearly burning himself. JJ was a devious fucking twink, but he knew how to get him going. In a flurry of unmatched speed, Jude dressed himself and headed out to his living room, where he had left his hoodie. In his excitement, he left his phone on the bed before heading into the cold winter night.</p>\n<p>Nearly tripping over himself (Whether due to the floor being icy or his own excitement is something still up for debate.) as he neared the mailbox, Jude reached into his pockets and pulled out his keys. He fiddled about with the cold metal for a moment before finally finding the correct one and inserting it into the equally as cold metal door of the mailbox.</p>\n<p>Finally, it opened, only to reveal nothing within.</p>\n<p>Jude blinked. Had JJ lied to him? No, he wouldn't do that. Surely this was the mail's fault. The stupid mail system always fucked up his packages, though that was probably the Foundation interfering with his business. Either way, it sucked. With a sigh of defeat, he slinked back up to his apartment. At least he had a blunt waiting for him when he got back.</p>\n<div class=\"outside\">\n<p><span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\">The girl</span> sat in the pew in her new blue church dress. After being scolded for being ungrateful for the presents her parents (and very specifically not Santa Claus) had bought for her, and then being told she needed to be happy with girl gifts because <span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\">Blondie</span> was, in fact, a girl, she had been forced to get dressed to attend Christmas mass. <span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\">The girl</span> fidgeted in her dress as the priest continued the mass.</p>\n<p>\"The day of joy returns, Father in Heaven, and crowns another year with peace and good will. Help us rightly to remember the birth of Jesus, that we may share in the song of the angels, the gladness of the shepherds, and the worship of the wisemen. Close the doors of hate and open the doors of love all over the world\u2026 Let kindness come with every gift and good desires with every greeting. Deliver us from evil, by the blessing that Christ brings, and teach us to be merry with clean hearts. May the Christmas morning make us happy to be thy children, And the Christmas evening bring us to our bed with grateful thoughts, forgiving and forgiven, for Jesus\u2019 sake. Amen.\"</p>\n<p>\"Amen,\" the congregation repeated, but not <span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\">the girl</span>.</p>\n<p>Later, <span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\">the girl</span> found herself in the confessional booth. She sat down on the hard wooden bench and shut her eyes.</p>\n<p>\"May God, who has enlightened every heart, help you to know your sins and trust in his mercy,\" the priest spoke.</p>\n<p>\"Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. It has been one day since my last confession, and these are my sins.\" <span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\">The girl</span> took a deep breath. \"I wanted boy gifts when I should be happy with girl gifts.\"</p>\n<p>\"I see. Is that all?\"</p>\n<p>\"That is all I remember, Father.\"</p>\n<p>\"You know what to do, then, my child.\"</p>\n<p>\"My God, I am sorry for my sins with all my heart. In choosing to do wrong and failing to do good, I have sinned against you whom I should love above all things. I firmly intend, with your help, to do penance, to sin no more, and to avoid whatever leads me to sin. Our Savior Jesus Christ suffered and died for us. In his name, my God, have mercy. Amen.\"</p>\n<p>\"Amen.\"</p>\n<p><span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\">The girl he used to be</span> suddenly shocked herself with nothing as she unclasped her hands. She softly exclaimed in pain as she left the confessional.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Jude opened the door to his apartment and mindlessly used his Stand to flick on the light switch. His eyes shifted over to his old family crucifix on the wall of his living room. It had been passed down through the generations; he had forgotten exactly how many, and here it was now. At the end of his bloodline. If anything, he found it funny that after so many centuries (If even that long.) it would probably wind up at a Goodwill after he died.</p>\n<p>And still, he felt guilty about it. Good old Catholic guilt. Jude approached the crucifix, looking it over. It was made of hand-carved wood, and the big J-man himself lay crucified on it. The colors on him were a bit faded, but one could still tell that it was Jesus. As if anyone else would be present on a crucifix anyway.</p>\n<p>He sighed, then made the sign of the Cross before clasping his hands together.</p>\n<p>\"Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. My last confession was\u2026.uh\u2026.fuck. Sorry. I shouldn't curse when I'm talking to you. But anyway, I've sinned. And I can't remember the last time I confessed. So yeah. I have lusted. Over a boy. And\u2026 damn it, I'm gay as hell. And I also cursed, as you just heard. And also I committed a whole lot of sloth. So, uh. Sorry.\"</p>\n<p>The only sound throughout the apartment was that of the heater working overtime in the snow.</p>\n<p>\"Anyway. I should probably say the thing. How did it go? Uh. <em>Confiteor Deo omnipotenti, beatae Mariae semper Virgini, beato Michaeli Archangelo, beato Ioanni Baptist\u2014</em>\"</p>\n<p>Suddenly, a giggle came from behind the shut door leading to Jude's room.</p>\n<p>He turned around, electricity crackling at his fingers and making static surround him.</p>\n<p>\"Who the fuck is there? I don't want to hurt you, but I swear to God I will if I have to.\"</p>\n<p>\"Relax, big boy,\" a familiar voice came from within.</p>\n<p>\"\u2026 Esther?\" Jude lowered his hands, the static around him disappearing.</p>\n<p>\"You know it, champ!\" Another voice chimed in.</p>\n<p>\"JJ?\"</p>\n<p>\"Merry Christmas, bud!\" A third.</p>\n<p>\"Faeowynn?\"</p>\n<p>Jude opened the door. Sure enough, all three of his closest friends were within his room, with Fae holding a plastic bag full of containers and JJ a small giftwrapped box.</p>\n<p>\"W\u2014what are you all doing here?\" He asked, taking a step forward.</p>\n<p>\"We came to cheer you up.\" Fae smiled.</p>\n<p>\"Were you seriously just doing <em>mea culpas</em> out there?\" JJ quirked an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\"The hell is wrong with you, you idiot?\" Esther laughed.</p>\n<p>\"S\u2014shut up.\" Jude choked out, his eyes watering.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, don't cry, big man.\" Esther teased. \"By the way, uh, real nice place you've got here. Really dig the decorations.\" She motioned towards all the trash bags.</p>\n<p>\"S\u2014sorry\u2026I just\u2026I don't know what to say\u2026\" Jude sniffled.</p>\n<p>\"Tell you what. Why don't we work on cleaning up these bags and tossing them all out in the dumpster, then we can sit down and have some leftovers I made from yesterday's Nochebuena dinner at Alex's parent's house?\" Fae held up her bag.</p>\n<p>\"That sounds good.\" Jude smiled. \"By the way, JJ, did you really send me something? I don't think it got to me.\"</p>\n<p>\"No, you idiot. The mail doesn't run on Christmas.\"</p>\n<p>\"But what about\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\"The picture? What do you think is in the box?\" JJ winked.</p>\n<p>Jude blushed, and the others laughed.</p>\n<p>\"R\u2014really?\" Jude took the box from JJ and tugged at the wrapping.</p>\n<p>\"Open the box!\" JJ urged.</p>\n<p>\"But\u2026\" Jude bit his lip.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, don't worry about him. He's a twink, they have no shame.\" Esther said, and the two women laughed.</p>\n<p>Jude took a deep breath and tore open the wrapping on the box. For the first time in years, he felt himself getting excited for a present. Even if it was as stupid and gay as a picture of JJ shirtless. The paper fell to the ground.</p>\n<p>He held a Bumblebee Transformers action figure in its box.</p>\n<p>Big, gross, ugly tears fell from Jude's face and onto the torn paper below.</p>\n<p>\"H\u2014how\u2026.how did you know\u2026\" He stammered, hands shaking as he eyed the toy.</p>\n<p>\"Don't you remember? My Stand's power is luck!\" JJ winked, giving a thumbs up.</p>\n<p>\"More like you spent an hour backsrolling through chat logs in the Walmart parking lot.\" Esther snarked.</p>\n<p>\"But it worked out!\" Fae shrugged. \"Stand or not, we were lucky to discover it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thank you guys\u2026\" Jude sniffled, wiping tears from his face. \"You have no idea what this means to me.\" He hugged JJ, who returned the embrace. Fae set her bag on the bed and put her arms around them both. Esther rolled her eyes and smiled, then joined in.</p>\n<p>\"Merry Christmas, Jude Kriyot.\"</p>\n<p><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/></p>\n<div class=\"collection\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div

The lights were off and the ceiling fan directly above spun about halfheartedly. The pungent smell of weed filled the air, alongside the stench of various bags of trash Jude had neglected to take out over the course of the month. A single blunt was clutched between the fingers on his left hand and a lighter was palmed in his right. Jude hadn't found the energy to light it yet.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"outside\"]]\n\n\"Merry Christmas, [[span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\"]]Blondie[[/span]]! Don't you look darling in your little dress!\" \n\n\n\nAunt Janie entered the living room where she and her cousins were playing Smash Brothers on a Nintendo 64. She leaned over and pinched [[span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\"]]the girl[[/span]]'s cheeks. \"You're growing into a beautiful woman! You look so much like your mother, she must be so proud of you.\"\n\n\n\n[[span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\"]]The girl[[/span]] forced a smile. She fidgeted in her dress. It felt like a prison. At least while she was playing video games she could escape into them. She liked playing Link because he was handsome. Her cousins teased her that she had a crush on him, but [[span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\"]]the girl[[/span]] wasn't sure if that was what it was. \"Thanks, Aunt Janie,\" she grimaced, then turned her attention back to the ongoing match between two of her older cousins. \n\n\n\n\"Were you a good girl this year, [[span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\"]]Blondie[[/span]]?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes.\" She could feel bugs crawling under her skin. She could feel her palms tingling. She could feel her eye twitching. \n\n\n\n\"And what did you ask Santa for this year? A Barbie?\"\n\n\n\n\"No. I asked for a Transformer. And a Nintendo 64 with Smash Brothers so I can play at my house.\"\n\n\n\n\"A Transformer? You're a silly girl, that's a boy's toy.\" \n\n\n\nThe Nintendo 64 suddenly malfunctioned and flicked off, much to the annoyance of the boys playing.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nSuddenly, a ping.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n\n**##orange|jockjamsvol6:##** Hey jude sorry to bother you on christmas but i sent you a present!!\n\n**##orange|jockjamsvol6:##** Go get it, I just got the notification that it arrived right now.\n\n**##orange|jockjamsvol6:##** And don't forget to call me, i want to hear your reaction to it!!\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nHe sighed. What was the point of getting up? Besides, it was snowing out and he didn't want to get dressed, walk down the apartment building's stairs, find his mailbox key, just to go grab something that was probably stupid from JJ. It would be there tomorrow. He could grab it then. Preferably when it wasn't snowing. \n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n\n**##green|bluntfiend:##** I'm not feeling well right now.\n\n**##green|bluntfiend:##** Maybe later.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nTossing his phone on the bed, Jude then picked up his lighter again and flicked it on, attempting to light his blunt with it. \n\n\n\n[[div class=\"outside\"]]\n\n[[span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\"]]The girl[[/span]] and her family sat gathered around a fully lit and decorated Christmas tree. Ornaments, lights, garlands, the works. Her mother fussed with a video camera, trying to get it on properly while her father sat on his recliner sipping on coffee. \n\n\n\n\"Alright, [[span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\"]]Blondie[[/span]]! Go ahead and start opening gifts!\" Her mother smiled, pointing the camera at [[span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\"]]the girl[[/span]].\n\n\n\n[[span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\"]]The girl[[/span]] excitedly began to tear open the paper wrapping the nearest gift. Moments later, she held up a blue church dress. [[span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\"]]The girl[[/span]] bit her lip, then set it aside. On to the next present. Again, she opened this one quickly, only to reveal a pink box containing a Barbie. [[span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\"]]The girl[[/span]] put the Barbie down and took a deep breath.\n\n\n\n\"Do you like it? She's President Barbie!\" Her mom beamed from behind the camera as the lights on the Christmas tree flickered until they shut off entirely. \n\n\n\n\"I wanted a Transformer...\" [[span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\"]]Blondie[[/span]] choked, tears streaming down her cheeks. \"Was I not good enough for Santa?\" \n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nAnother ping.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n\n**##orange|jockjamsvol6:##** I'll send you a shirtless pic if you do\n\n**##orange|jockjamsvol6:##** ;)\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nJude blushed at this. He dropped his blunt on his thigh, nearly burning himself. JJ was a devious fucking twink, but he knew how to get him going. In a flurry of unmatched speed, Jude dressed himself and headed out to his living room, where he had left his hoodie. In his excitement, he left his phone on the bed before heading into the cold winter night.\n\n\n\nNearly tripping over himself (Whether due to the floor being icy or his own excitement is something still up for debate.)\u00a0\u00a0as he neared the mailbox, Jude reached into his pockets and pulled out his keys. He fiddled about with the cold metal for a moment before finally finding the correct one and inserting it into the equally as cold metal door of the mailbox.\n\n\n\nFinally, it opened, only to reveal nothing within.\n\n\n\nJude blinked. Had JJ lied to him? No, he wouldn't do that. Surely this was the mail's fault. The stupid mail system always fucked up his packages, though that was probably the Foundation interfering with his business. Either way, it sucked. With a sigh of defeat, he slinked back up to his apartment. At least he had a blunt waiting for him when he got back.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"outside\"]]\n\n[[span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\"]]The girl[[/span]] sat in the pew in her new blue church dress. After being scolded for being ungrateful for the presents her parents (and very specifically not Santa Claus) had bought for her, and then being told she needed to be happy with girl gifts because [[span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\"]]Blondie[[/span]] was, in fact, a girl, she had been forced to get dressed to attend Christmas mass. [[span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\"]]The girl[[/span]] fidgeted in her dress as the priest continued the mass.\n\n\n\n\"The day of joy returns, Father in Heaven, and crowns another year with peace and good will. Help us rightly to remember the birth of Jesus, that we may share in the song of the angels, the gladness of the shepherds, and the worship of the wisemen. Close the doors of hate and open the doors of love all over the world\u2026 Let kindness come with every gift and good desires with every greeting. Deliver us from evil, by the blessing that Christ brings, and teach us to be merry with clean hearts. May the Christmas morning make us happy to be thy children, And the Christmas evening bring us to our bed with grateful thoughts, forgiving and forgiven, for Jesus\u2019 sake. Amen.\"\n\n\n\n\"Amen,\" the congregation repeated, but not [[span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\"]]the girl[[/span]].\n\n\n\nLater, [[span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\"]]the girl[[/span]] found herself in the confessional booth. She sat down on the hard wooden bench and shut her eyes.\n\n\n\n\"May God, who has enlightened every heart, help you to know your sins and trust in his mercy,\" the priest spoke.\n\n\n\n\"Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. It has been one day since my last confession, and these are my sins.\" [[span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\"]]The girl[[/span]] took a deep breath. \"I wanted boy gifts when I should be happy with girl gifts.\"\n\n\n\n\"I see. Is that all?\"\n\n\n\n\"That is all I remember, Father.\"\n\n\n\n\"You know what to do, then, my child.\"\n\n\n\n\"My God, I am sorry for my sins with all my heart. In choosing to do wrong and failing to do good, I have sinned against you whom I should love above all things. I firmly intend, with your help, to do penance, to sin no more, and to avoid whatever leads me to sin. Our Savior Jesus Christ suffered and died for us. In his name, my God, have mercy. Amen.\"\n\n\n\n\"Amen.\"\n\n\n\n[[span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\"]]The girl he used to be[[/span]] suddenly shocked herself with nothing as she unclasped her hands. She softly exclaimed in pain as she left the confessional.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nJude opened the door to his apartment and mindlessly used his Stand to flick on the light switch. His eyes shifted over to his old family crucifix on the wall of his living room. It had been passed down through the generations; he had forgotten exactly how many, and here it was now. At the end of his bloodline. If anything, he found it funny that after so many centuries (If even that long.) it would probably wind up at a Goodwill after he died.\n\n\n\nAnd still, he felt guilty about it. Good old Catholic guilt. Jude approached the crucifix, looking it over. It was made of hand-carved wood, and the big J-man himself lay crucified on it. The colors on him were a bit faded, but one could still tell that it was Jesus. As if anyone else would be present on a crucifix anyway.\n\n\n\nHe sighed, then made the sign of the Cross before clasping his hands together.\n\n\n\n\"Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. My last confession was....uh....fuck. Sorry. I shouldn't curse when I'm talking to you. But anyway, I've sinned. And I can't remember the last time I confessed. So yeah. I have lusted. Over a boy. And... damn it, I'm gay as hell. And I also cursed, as you just heard. And also I committed a whole lot of sloth. So, uh. Sorry.\"\n\n\n\nThe only sound throughout the apartment was that of the heater working overtime in the snow.\n\n\n\n\"Anyway. I should probably say the thing. How did it go? Uh. //Confiteor Deo omnipotenti, beatae Mariae semper Virgini, beato Michaeli Archangelo, beato Ioanni Baptist--//\"\n\n\n\nSuddenly, a giggle came from behind the shut door leading to Jude's room. \n\n\n\nHe turned around, electricity crackling at his fingers and making static surround him. \n\n\n\n\"Who the fuck is there? I don't want to hurt you, but I swear to God I will if I have to.\"\n\n\n\n\"Relax, big boy,\" a familiar voice came from within.\n\n\n\n\"... Esther?\" Jude lowered his hands, the static around him disappearing. \n\n\n\n\"You know it, champ!\" Another voice chimed in.\n\n\n\n\"JJ?\"\n\n\n\n\"Merry Christmas, bud!\" A third.\n\n\n\n\"Faeowynn?\"\n\n\n\nJude opened the door. Sure enough, all three of his closest friends were within his room, with Fae holding a plastic bag full of containers and JJ a small giftwrapped box.\n\n\n\n\"W--what are you all doing here?\" He asked, taking a step forward.\n\n\n\n\"We came to cheer you up.\" Fae smiled. \n\n\n\n\"Were you seriously just doing //mea culpas// out there?\" JJ quirked an eyebrow.\n\n\n\n\"The hell is wrong with you, you idiot?\" Esther laughed.\n\n\n\n\"S--shut up.\" Jude choked out, his eyes watering.\n\n\n\n\"Oh, don't cry, big man.\" Esther teased. \"By the way, uh, real nice place you've got here. Really dig the decorations.\" She motioned towards all the trash bags.\n\n\n\n\"S--sorry...I just...I don't know what to say...\" Jude sniffled.\n\n\n\n\"Tell you what. Why don't we work on cleaning up these bags and tossing them all out in the dumpster, then we can sit down and have some leftovers I made from yesterday's Nochebuena dinner at Alex's parent's house?\" Fae held up her bag.\n\n\n\n\"That sounds good.\" Jude smiled. \"By the way, JJ, did you really send me something? I don't think it got to me.\"\n\n\n\n\"No, you idiot. The mail doesn't run on Christmas.\"\n\n\n\n\"But what about--\"\n\n\n\n\"The picture? What do you think is in the box?\" JJ winked.\n\n\n\nJude blushed, and the others laughed. \n\n\n\n\"R--really?\" Jude took the box from JJ and tugged at the wrapping.\n\n\n\n\"Open the box!\" JJ urged.\n\n\n\n\"But...\" Jude bit his lip.\n\n\n\n\"Oh, don't worry about him. He's a twink, they have no shame.\" Esther said, and the two women laughed.\n\n\n\nJude took a deep breath and tore open the wrapping on the box. For the first time in years, he felt himself getting excited for a present. Even if it was as stupid and gay as a picture of JJ shirtless. The paper fell to the ground.\n\n\n\nHe held a Bumblebee Transformers action figure in its box.\n\n\n\nBig, gross, ugly tears fell from Jude's face and onto the torn paper below.\n\n\n\n\"H--how....how did you know...\" He stammered, hands shaking as he eyed the toy.\n\n\n\n\"Don't you remember? My Stand's power is luck!\" JJ winked, giving a thumbs up.\n\n\n\n\"More like you spent an hour backsrolling through chat logs in the Walmart parking lot.\" Esther snarked.\n\n\n\n\"But it worked out!\" Fae shrugged. \"Stand or not, we were lucky to discover it.\"\n\n\n\n\"Thank you guys...\" Jude sniffled, wiping tears from his face. \"You have no idea what this means to me.\" He hugged JJ, who returned the embrace. Fae set her bag on the bed and put her arms around\u00a0\u00a0them both.

Kondraki is out of bed and on the floor in seconds, except the floor isn\u2019t as flat as he remembers and the walls are squeezing in on him and the very <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span> feels alive and hungry.</p>\n<p>Clef is writhing on the bed, clutching his head as antlers attempt to tear through his skull. Three parallel cuts appear on his back as if an invisible paw took a swipe at him. Any thoughts Kondraki had were immediately replaced with the need to protect.</p>\n<p>Kondraki kneels on the bed, reaching over Clef to flip on the lamp. He throws the blankets aside and takes Clef in his arms. Clef tenses and then goes limp. His breathing is heavy and sharp.</p>\n<p>\u201c<a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4231\">I am telling the truth</a>. I am telling the truth\u2026\u201d he mumbles between painful gasps.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know. I believe you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef chokes on his own snot and mucus. Kondraki holds him even as his blood soaks into his clothes and it feels like the bed is trying to eat him. Ignoring everything else around him, he rocks Clef back and forth.</p>\n<p>Clef can\u2019t see, can\u2019t breathe. He\u2019s drowning, the lake is rising, boiling. He\u2019s running up stairs that don\u2019t stop, don\u2019t end, impossibly tall. He can\u2019t breathe, water fills the <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span>. He holds his daughter above the murky surface but it\u2019s not enough, the water is faster than him, the <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span> is unrelenting. <em>It doesn\u2019t stop it doesn\u2019t stop it doesn\u2019t stop it doesn\u2019t stop-</em></p>\n<p>Clef opens his three, beady eyes. He squirms, nearly smacking Kondraki with his newly formed antlers. Kondraki tries to look comforting but it comes out more panicked.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you hear me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef can\u2019t speak, can\u2019t breathe, his mouth too full of lake water and mold. He spits up on Kondraki\u2019s shirt. He wants to scream, to beg for mercy. He <em>is</em> telling the truth, he <em>is</em> telling the-</p>\n<p>Carefully, with a grace he did not possess, Kondraki drags Clef from the bed and into the bathroom. Clef vomits into the toilet while Kondraki runs a washcloth under warm water and cleans up the blood. Clef can\u2019t quite look at him, can\u2019t quite focus on anything.</p>\n<p>Kondraki drops to Clef's side, pressing the warm cloth into the fresh cuts on his cheek. Clef doesn\u2019t move, too scared to. He sucks in a sharp breath as the cloth runs down his neck. He breaks out into weak sobs, just a quivering mess on his bathroom floor.</p>\n<p>Logically speaking, he knows exactly where he is. He\u2019s in his home, a twenty minute drive from Site-19. He\u2019s with Kondraki. He <em>trusts</em> Kondraki, whatever trust means these days. He\u2019s safe here.</p>\n<p>At the same time, over a thousand miles away, he\u2019s also in an abandoned <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span>. He\u2019s still curled under the floorboards, breathing in the mold and dust, waiting for <em>her</em> to find him. For a moment, the man in the floorboards woke up, and Clef felt his terror.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Kondraki asks, sounding distant.</p>\n<p>Clef nods, still not quite able to look at him.</p>\n<p>Kondraki takes a cup from their nightstand and fills it with water. Clef drinks it- or tries to, most of it ends up on his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef shakes his head. He\u2019s not sure if he even can talk right now. The antlers are gone, and the cuts are closed, if still sore. Kondraki takes Clef\u2019s hands and Clef leans in, resting his head on Kondraki\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want to watch a movie?\u201d Clef had a couple of movies downloaded on his laptop that he liked to watch after moments like this. He nods.</p>\n<p>Kondraki helps Clef to his feet, supporting him on their back back to their bedroom. Kondraki wraps the blanket around them, setting the laptop between them. They watch <em>Animal <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">House</span></em>and Clef lets himself forget whatever had him scared.</p>\n<p>He watches Kondraki sink into the bed, forcing his eyes open every couple of seconds before giving up and passing out. Clef drags the back of his knuckles against Kondraki\u2019s scratchy beard. The laptop is put away.</p>\n<p>This feels right. Clef is safe here. He\u2019s earned this security, nothing can take this away from him.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>9:16\u00a0pm, Clef\u2019s office, two hours after <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-king-is-dead\">Kondraki\u2019s death</a>:</strong></p>\n<p>Draven finds Clef on the floor of his office, stinking of beer and vomit. There\u2019s something so sickly familiar about this position. <em>God</em>, how many times did he find his own father in this exact situation? Passed out in a pool of alcohol and his own filth? It even smells like the same brand.</p>\n<p>He drops to one knee by Clef\u2019s side. \u201cClef?\u201d Clef lets out a soft groan, curling in on himself. \u201cAlto?\u201d Draven says, softer, laying a hand on Clef\u2019s side. Clef flinches. Draven scoots in closer, gently leaning on him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t let me see him,\u201d Draven says. \u201cI guess I don't need to see it for myself to know what happened\u2026\u201d He\u2019s imagined this scenario a thousand times, he can picture his father\u2019s corpse with photographic clarity.</p>\n<p>Clef mumbles something.</p>\n<p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t save him\u2026\u201d Upon closer inspection, Clef is wrapped around a ratty jacket, a green butterfly wing pinched between his knuckles. His father\u2019s jacket. Draven swallows a lump in his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt wasn't your responsibility to save him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draven won\u2019t claim to know all the intricacies of the relationship between his father and his mentor. Frankly, he doesn\u2019t want to. But he did, over the course of several years, watch Clef go from <em>\u201cthat ugly bastard\u201d</em> to <em>\u201cmy coworker\u201d</em> to <em>\u201cDr. Clef\u201d</em> to <em>\u201cmy friend\u201d</em> and then finally to <em>\u201cAlto\u201d</em>. It was Clef who took care of his father when Draven wasn\u2019t there, and for that Draven could only be grateful\u2026</p>\n<p>He wishes he could say he was surprised to hear that his father shot himself. But that\u2019s not true. His father was never a stable man. This made perfect sense. Anyone could\u2019ve seen it coming.</p>\n<p>Draven isn\u2019t sure what he\u2019s feeling right now\u2026 <em>Hungry</em>. He\u2019s feeling hungry. Hunger is a feeling he can understand, something he can satiate.</p>\n<p>\u201cClef?\u2026 Let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d Draven stands and watches Clef lay there for several moments. Finally, Clef drags himself off the floor. He won\u2019t look Draven in the eyes. Whatever, emotions to deal with later.</p>\n<p>He loops an arm under Clef\u2019s shoulder and they walk in unsteady tandem. Draven remembers the hushed whispers as they pass, the prying eyes, the feeling that creeps in his veins. He remembers passing by the site director\u2019s office, catching a whiff of blood, and swallowing the vomit in his mouth.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t remember, as he drags Clef into the parking lot, making eye contact with the site director. He doesn\u2019t remember how the site director\u2019s eyes fill with momentary fear. He doesn\u2019t remember the site director walking away, tense. He doesn\u2019t even remember <em>who</em> the site director is.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s mold growing in Clef\u2019s sink. Draven takes the time to wash Clef\u2019s dishes while Clef stares off into space at the table. He jumps as something brushes up against his leg. He leans down to pat L.S.\u2019s head, getting soap on its sunken face.</p>\n<p>He makes food, using whatever he can find in Clef\u2019s cabinets. It\u2019s the least he can do, in his mind. Draven knows once he\u2019s done eating he\u2019ll be forced to feel everything he\u2019s choosing not to. He knows when it\u2019s time to put his father in the ground he\u2019ll break. He knows it\u2019s coming. But not yet, he won\u2019t let himself break yet.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>12:47 am, <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/lets-get-you-home\">The Bitter End</a>, one year and seven months after Kondraki\u2019s death:</strong></p>\n<p>Jonathan Tucker did not like calling the cops on people. He worked the late shift at a bar outside of town, it was practically in his job description that he is expected to deal with dangerous, intoxicated people. Still, even if it meant he would be stuck here way past closing, he\u2019d rather exhaust all other options before that.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs there someone I can call for you? Someone you trust?\u201d He asks the red faced man at the counter.</p>\n<p>\u201cHehe- <em>sure</em>. You got a- a fucking <em>ouija board</em> back there?\u201d The man laughs; it sounds like nails against a chalkboard. Tucker puts his head in his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not serving you any more drinks. We\u2019re closed. Please either leave quietly or I\u2019ll have to call the police.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCall the cops! I\u2019ll fuck \u2018em up!\u201d The man punches the air with more force than Tucker is comfortable with. Tucker is reaching for the phone when the door creaks open.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re closed?\u201d Looking back on it, Tucker can\u2019t describe what the new stranger looks like. He looks clean, out of place in a run down place like this. Tucker almost wants to apologize for the sorry state of this place.</p>\n<p>The clean man speaks. Tucker can\u2019t remember exactly what he says, but he thinks that at one point he\u2019s asked his name. The man leans over the moldy counter and writes two checks. Tucker\u2019s stomach drops as he reads the one written for him. That\u2019s more than triple the tips he\u2019s received since he got this job.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave a good night, sir!\u201d He waves the two men off, heart pounding in his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is kidnapping!\u201d The drunkard screams, \u201cYou\u2019re letting this guy kidnap me!\u201d Tucker ignores him. He sees this type of behavior a lot and he\u2019s not willing to consider this situation more than he has to.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>1:09 am, <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/self-similar\">Nobody\u2019s bedroom</a>, three months before Nobody smashes a bottle over Clef\u2019s head:</strong></p>\n<p>Nobody is lying in bed when the door creaks open. He doesn\u2019t move, pretending to sleep. Clef creeps up next to him, closing the door behind him. Nobody can\u2019t see the expression Clef is making, he doesn\u2019t have to.</p>\n<p>Clef walks around the bed and crawls under the covers, his chest to Nobody\u2019s back. Nobody chews his lip, tearing off layers of skin. Clef is warm, a little radiator. Nobody wants to get closer, wants to hold Clef like they love each other. That\u2019s what Clef is offering.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t, though. He\u2019s <em>frozen</em> to the spot. Clef can close his eyes and pretend that he\u2019s in bed with Kondraki, but Nobody doesn\u2019t get that privilege. He doesn\u2019t have false love to project onto Clef. He doesn\u2019t want to be Kondraki\u2019s <em>replacement</em>.</p>\n<p>He made a promise to keep Clef safe. That\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t scream when Clef gets into his bed, that\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t elbow him in the face as he scoots closer, that\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t cry as Clef snuggles up and brushes his cheek against Nobody\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p>Iceberg stands in the corner of the room, just out of Nobody\u2019s vision. Nobody can feel him there. Clef holds him close and Nobody tries very hard not to feel cold.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>8:53\u00a0pm, Nobody\u2019s kitchen, five seconds after Nobody smashed a bottle over Clef\u2019s head:</strong></p>\n<p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you just be good?\u201d Gears gasps, desperation and fury crawling into his voice. \u201cAm I not kind to you? Have I not cared for you?\u201d He drops the bottle, letting it clang against the floor.</p>\n<p>Clef can\u2019t move, can\u2019t breathe, can\u2019t speak. Blood pours into his face. It feels <em>good</em> when Gears attacks him, a split moment of pure bliss. And then the moment passes and he\u2019s just standing there, Gears red faced and panting over him.</p>\n<p>At this moment, more than anything, Clef wants to kiss him. He wants to wrap his arms around Gears\u2019s waist and pull him in. He <em>needs</em> Gears to pin him to the counter top and lock their lips while he <em>guts</em> him with the broken shards.</p>\n<p>Gears storms off. A door slams. L.S. skitters into the kitchen, claws tapping against the tile. Clef just stands there, eyes locked on the place where Gears should be. His head throbs, takes a hell of a swing to break a beer bottle like that.</p>\n<p>He drags himself from the kitchen into the bathroom just to stare at himself in the mirror. Cold water pours from the faucet, Clef forces his head under the spout. It feels nice for a moment. He tries to fix up his hair only to slice his palm on a shard. He should go to the doctor.</p>\n<p>For a moment, he stands in front of Gears\u2019s door. He should say something\u2026</p>\n<p>The cold outside air makes his head throb even more. He sits in his truck, running his fingers over the leather steering wheel. The truck sputters to life. Clef wonders how far he could get in his thing, he could stop to get gas and just <em>go</em> until he\u2019s far, far, far away from this damned <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span>.</p>\n<p>No one at Site-19 gives him a second look. <em>Of course, that\u2019s just Dr. Clef, he\u2019s always walking around soaked in blood.</em> He sits his ass in the nurse's office and waits.</p>\n<p>The nurse picks out each piece of glass, wraps up his head, asks him a few questions. Clef resists the urge to tell her to fuck off, he doesn\u2019t <em>have</em> to explain shit, doesn\u2019t <em>want</em> to either. She gives him a packet of paperwork and leaves him alone.</p>\n<p>Slipped in between the standard paperwork is a card. <em>Domestic Abuse Hotline.</em> Clef almost laughs. God, what a <em>punchline</em>, really caught him off guard. He crumbles the card in his fist and throws it on the ground.</p>\n<p>Even if this was <em>domestic abuse</em>, which it isn\u2019t, not to him, what\u2019s some veiled hotline gonna do for someone who legally doesn\u2019t exist? What\u2019s any hotline gonna do against someone like Gears? It\u2019s just a bad joke, something to keep up appearances rather than help anyone. Clef steps on the crumpled ball on his way out.</p>\n<p>He returns home. <em>Home</em>\u2026 is that what he\u2019s calling Gears\u2019s <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span> now? He lets himself in, locking the door behind him. There\u2019s a glass of water sitting on his nightstand, which he appreciates. Maybe an olive branch.</p>\n<p>L.S. curls up in his bed as he drifts off to sleep.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>10:56 am, Site-19, two months before Clef has a mental breakdown in front of Adams:</strong></p>\n<p>Clef\u2019s drop in energy is sudden. Anyone who works with him saw it, the bags under his eyes, the weakness in his smile, the way he would start sentences and then drift off, losing his train of thought. Adams would often find him face down in his desk, completely unresponsive.</p>\n<p>At first Adams wondered what she had done to earn this blessing. Clef no longer made his weird, sexually charged comments, no longer rambled to her for hours, no longer <em>spoke</em> at all. She is finally free to do what <em>she</em> wants.</p>\n<p>And then the silence gets to her.</p>\n<p>It feels wrong to walk by Clef\u2019s side in complete silence. The coffee in his hand isn\u2019t doing anything for him. Adams feels antsy, like a zoo animal without enrichment, pacing around her cage.</p>\n<p>\u201cSir\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>He perks up. \u201cHm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 Did you know Britain's oldest woman turned one hundred and fourteen today?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would I give a shit about that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust thought you might want to know, given your age.\u201d A grunt, good, she continues, \u201cShe claimed her age was because of a long walk she took every night. When she was asked if she was concerned about the increase in muggings in recent years, she said that she was not, and would continue mugging people as long as her health holds out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef blinks slowly, Adams can see the cogs turning behind his eyes. A grin slowly spreads across his face. \u201c<em>Adams</em>,\u201d he says, aghast. \u201cDid you just <em>dad joke</em> me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid I?\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed in you. I know you can do better than that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGuess I only have a poor teacher to blame.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh you\u2019re <em>bad</em> today. Okay, I\u2019ll give you one better.\u201d He cracks his knuckles and takes a long gulp of coffee. Adams mentally braces herself for the worst joke in human history. \u201cSo a man and his wife are at a restaurant, and the husband keeps\u2026 He keeps staring at- there\u2019s this woman at the other end of the\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef stops in his tracks. The mug slips from his hand. Adams has all of three seconds to snatch him by the shirt before he hits the ground. Arms shaking, she slowly lays him down.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is Agent Adams, I\u2019m on floor twenty-four B. Dr. Clef has just collapsed. He\u2019s unresponsive. Over,\u201d she says into her comms device. Clef doesn\u2019t stir. It\u2019s uncanny seeing him like this.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cAre you serious? Alright, sending a few men your way. Did he show any signs of injury or sickness before collapsing?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cNo- well yes? Kinda?\u201d There\u2019s not a good way to say she\u2019s been regularly letting him pass out at work. \u201cHe\u2019s seemed a little sick lately, but this is the first time he\u2019s just- dropped.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cUnderstood. I\u2019ll contact the site director, let him know what happened.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Three guards in uniform show up and lug Clef down to the hospital wing. Adams is told to return to work, but she sticks around, eavesdropping in on two nurses.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cYeah, apparently he came in a couple weeks ago, middle of the night, glass and shit sticking out of his head. Wouldn\u2019t tell Vesta anything. I mean what are we supposed to do? Tell a guy who kills for fun to stay out of bar fights?\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cYou think a head injury could\u2019ve knocked something loose? Gave him a stroke?\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cI doubt it. Looks to me like he just took too much sleeping medication. Same thing kept happening a couple years ago when the Foundation was prescribing everyone those amnestics. Besides, I think a brain injury might improve his health.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>The nurses go silent as Clef drags himself out of the hospital room. His face is pulled in a tight scowl.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey! You can\u2019t just leave!\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef flips her off and storms out. Adams catches him in the hallway.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you! You- you <em>freaked me out</em> back there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef bears his teeth. His cheeks are red, that flush spreading up to his ears. He opens his mouth, as if to speak, only to close it, grind his teeth, and push her out of the way. Adam trails him to his office.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you\u2019re just not going to talk to me? What\u2019s going on with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>He sits at his desk and puts his head in his hands. His entire demeanor shifts. Adams blinks and for a moment she thinks she\u2019s talking to a whole different person. Clef sucks in an audible, shuddering gasp.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d She meant it to come out a little firmer than that.</p>\n<p>He shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you really not going to talk to me?\u201d</p>\n<p>No response. Adams chews on her nail.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it that you <em>won\u2019t</em> talk to me or <em>can\u2019t</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef slowly drags a pad of sticky notes across the desk and scribbles down <em>can\u2019t</em>. Adams sits down, twitching with nervous energy.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay then\u2026 Why not?\u201d</p>\n<p>A shrug.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d</p>\n<p>Another shrug.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes this happen often?\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef thinks for a moment before writing: <em>It\u2019s not supposed to.</em></p>\n<p>Alright, okay, so your boss has passed out and is now nonverbal at work. They don\u2019t put these types of situations in the training booklets.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I\u2026 help you?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Just shut up about it. Don\u2019t tell anyone.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cFine. Fuck me for giving a shit about you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef grips his pen and scribbles something, and just as quickly scratches it out. He puts his head on his desk and huffs. He looks like an old dog.</p>\n<p>Then, something else enters. Adams can\u2019t remember who, but Clef straightens up in his seat and Adams follows suit. She remembers feeling afraid, and that\u2019s not something she\u2019s accustomed to.</p>\n<p>The person says a few words, asks a few questions, Clef responds with nothing. He looks defeated, and Adams thinks this is something she\u2019s not supposed to see. Even when the person leaves, the tension in his features remains.</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t talk about it. There\u2019s nothing to talk about at all.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>7:35 am, Clef\u2019s office, two days after Clef had a mental breakdown in front of Adams:</strong></p>\n<p>Adams can forget about what happened. Clef doesn\u2019t exactly have a reputation for being a stable person; it was only a matter of time until this place got to him in a way she could see.</p>\n<p>When he returns from work, two days after locking her in a closet and talking to\u2026 seemingly Nobody, she\u2019s ready to brush it under the carpet. Everyone\u2019s boss starts screaming at the walls occasionally, water under the bridge.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s until Clef\u2019s apologizes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says, looking her right in the eyes, \u201cthat you had to see what happened the other night. Wasn\u2019t in my right mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no joke, no prank, no code, nothing she could expect from Clef. Just a soft, genuine apology, and he moves on with his work.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s when Adams realizes something is <em>horribly</em> wrong.</p>\n<p><em>But what can she do about it?</em></p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>12:37 am, Site-19, three hours before the incident:</strong></p>\n<p>\u201cKondraki!\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/portraits-of-your-father\">Draven</a> jolts awake. He\u2019s in the back of a helicopter, which is now on a landing pad behind Site-19. He gathers up his bag and MTF helmet and steps off, thanking the pilot as he leaves.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been a long time since he\u2019s been to Site-19, a couple of months at least, maybe a year. He hasn\u2019t been back since the site director transferred him away\u2026 <em>who is the site director anyway?</em></p>\n<p>Despite the time, Draven finds his way to his old dorm with muscle memory. He sets his stuff down on the stiff cot and slides his phone out of his pocket. It\u2019s the middle of the night and his last message is still unread, but he texts Clef anyway.</p>\n<p>After his father\u2019s death, Draven spoke to Clef a lot. It was nice, not having to mourn by himself. And when Draven was transferred out, they tried to call or text everyday.</p>\n<p>And then Clef stopped answering calls. He rarely responded to messages, usually only at sporadic times and never answering Draven\u2019s questions. Draven, to his horror, felt another important person slipping from his grasp.</p>\n<p>This time of year is difficult for Clef, Draven knows that even if, like most things, he doesn\u2019t know the full context. Offering Clef some support is the least Draven can do for him.</p>\n<p>Draven lays down on the mold stained sheets and stares at the ceiling. He\u2019s not getting any sleep, is he? Damn.</p>\n<p>He stands, spending an hour tidying up the dorm. Even if he won\u2019t be here long, the next person will appreciate the effort. Then he makes his way down to the cafeteria, making light conversation with the other night shift workers. Feels like home.</p>\n<p>Eventually, the boredom hits. He still hasn\u2019t gotten a response on any of his messages. It would definitely be rude to just show up at Clef\u2019s <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span> at this hour, but in Draven\u2019s defense, he did try to warn him. If he still has a key to Clef\u2019s <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span> he can just let himself in, because that\u2019ll go down well.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I borrow a car? Or a bike?\u201d Draven asks, eyeing up the lot of Foundation vehicles.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cWhere the hell do you wanna go at this hour?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cIf you need to know, I want to visit Dr. Clef.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cYou know you could just- walk over there, right?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cHe lives just over- what the fuck?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Draven turns around just in time to see a <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span> shoot up into the sky. A great tower twisting upwards.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>3:24 am, Site-19, Secure humanoid containment cell, three minutes before the incident:</strong></p>\n<p>SCP-166 shoots out of bed, pure terror racking through her body. She hunches over the side of her bed and hacks up filthy water. She stands up, knocking her bible onto the ground with a <em>thump</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Something is wrong</em>. She can\u2019t name what, only that the feeling of <em>wrongness</em> is too much. Her legs tremble and something warm drips down her face. She drags herself to the wooden door of her containment cell and throws herself against it.</p>\n<p>Her head throbs. She\u2019s never had too much trouble with her antlers, but at this moment they feel so heavy. She jams them into the wall, tearing up the old wood. Something is pulling on her, she could really feel it now, and it\u2019s agonizing.</p>\n<p>Two figures in protective suits burst in. They speak to her, but she can\u2019t make out a word over the blood rushing in her ears. They yank her out of the wall, boards and splinters tearing over with her.</p>\n<p>Thick mold oozes out of the wall, it makes her dizzy and nauseous. The mold is in her, has always been in her. Growing and festering under her skin since her father dragged her, screaming, out of their <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span>. Except, of course, there\u2019s no mold in the Foundation\u2019s walls, and the guards are shouting at her.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into you!?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>She can\u2019t speak, lake water and mold pouring from her lips. <em>Don't they see it? Don\u2019t they see the mold that\u2019s growing between the cracks in the wall? It\u2019s growing in them too, she can feel it, it\u2019s settled deeply in their veins. How can they pretend to be okay with that?</em></p>\n<p>In the distance, Nobody wakes up to the feeling of blood dripping from the ceiling. SCP-166 passes out.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>???, Clef\u2019s home, <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/loosen-up-a-bit\">a kinder universe</a>:</strong></p>\n<p>They\u2019re in Clef\u2019s kitchen, Gears\u2019s face illuminated by the soft, warm light of a few scented candles. He looks good, better than good, he looks healthy. No longer the closed off, painfully skinny, lonely man Clef fell for <em>oh</em> so long ago.</p>\n<p>Gears twirls a knife in his hand and with precise, practiced motions, cuts a bag of onions into even slices, and then those slices into even squares. He slides a cold bottle of Sherry towards Clef, something to deglaze the pan before they caramelize the onions. Clef pops off the cap and puts the bottle to his lips, savoring the sweetly sticky drink. Gears sighs, fondly.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease take care to not cook drunk,\u201d he requests softly.</p>\n<p>Clef laughs. \u201cRight, right. Got a little ahead of myself there. Good thing I did, though. <em>Way</em> too sweet for this dish. I mean try it.\u201d He holds to bottle up, jamming it into Gears\u2019s face. Hesitantly, Gears takes a sip, letting Clef tip the bottle into his mouth. He lets it rest on his tongue for a moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, far too sweet. Would be more fitting for a dessert.\u201d He slides his tongue across his teeth.</p>\n<p>Clef waves a finger at him. \u201cSee? This is why you taste a little bit of everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cApologies for grabbing the wrong wine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize to me, you know I don\u2019t like that. Besides, we can always run and get another bottle. No harm, no foul.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit cold out\u2026 Are you sure you want to head out at this hour?\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef looks out the window. It is getting dark out, a thin layer of snow on the ground. He looks at Kondraki\u2019s- at <em>his</em> coat hanging up next to the door. \u201cI\u2019m sure I could\u2026 get someone to deliver it here. Hold on.\u201d</p>\n<p>While Clef works on ordering a new bottle, Gears makes a beef broth for the soup. The broth is made completely from scratch, of course. Clef can\u2019t help but be captivated as Gears works. To think, only a few months ago, it was Gears marveling as Clef showed him how a similar, smaller batch he made turned completely solid and almost gelatinous when chilled, a proper bone broth.</p>\n<p><em>You\u2019re beautiful,</em> Clef doesn\u2019t say, but he thinks it. He thinks it as a smile pulls on Gears\u2019s lips, an absent, unconscious little motion. His mind elsewhere as he stirs spices into the broth. It smells great. Clef stands uselessly, leaning against the counter, only watching while Gears works.</p>\n<p>So lost in thought, Clef doesn\u2019t realize how much time passes until there\u2019s a knock on the door. He shows his ID to the delivery boy, returning to the kitchen with a bit of frost on his hat, a fresh bottle of Sherry, dark chocolate, and strawberries. The too-sweet Sherry will go well with that, he thinks.</p>\n<p>With the fresh bottle, Clef begins to caramelize the onions. Gears flips through a cookbook. It\u2019s not one Clef bought him.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018S that new?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm? Oh this, yes it\u2019s new. I saw it at the store this morning while shopping.\u201d Gears runs his fingers along the smooth, unblemished pages. \u201cI haven't gotten a chance to read through it in its entirety, but it\u2019s quite fascinating. It discusses much of the science behind cooking!\u201d Gears slides easily into discussion. Clef nods along, even if he\u2019s not quite sure what a <em>centrifuge</em> is or what it has to do with cooking.</p>\n<p>The onions join the broth. Gears slices up a baguette, slathering each piece in butter and herbs, lining those up on a tray for the oven. Clef sorts through his fridge for the gruy\u00e8re cheese. Took him ages to find a quality block.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just grab a different type of cheese?\u201d Lament asked when Clef was complaining about this exact thing to Gears. Clef was about to tear Lament a new one when Gears caught both of them off guard, standing up for Clef\u2019s honor.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cEvery type of cheese is different in both make-up, texture, and flavor. Simply attempting to swap one cheese for another could throw off an entire dish.\u201d He said it in his usual calm, flat voice, but Clef could see the light in his eyes. The passion growing inside of him. He looked so alive, he looks so alive right now.</em></p>\n<p>Gears sips the soup out of a ladle- it\u2019s the blue one Clef bought because it looks like a dinosaur. Gears reaches into the spice cabinet for the thyme, his sweater rides up a bit. Clef nearly slices his hand open on the cheese grater when he catches a glimpse of Gears\u2019s stomach.</p>\n<p>Clef ladles the soup into ramekins, and tops it with one of the toasted crostini and a heap of freshly shredded gruy\u00e8re. They set it in the oven to broil, and watch intently as the cheese bubbles, blisters, and browns. Clef removes it with an oven glove.</p>\n<p>They sit across from each other and eat. It\u2019s comfortable, nearly silent. The only sound being Clef\u2019s slurping and Gears\u2019s soft hums of content. It\u2019s perfect, not just the soup but <em>this</em>. Gears <em>is</em> perfect.</p>\n<p>Once they finish, Gears gathers up the dishes for the sink. He decides he can wash those later, Clef is waiting for him on the couch, putting on a show for the both of them. Clef pours two glasses of the too-sweet Sherry and they toast to each other.</p>\n<p>Clef is so very happy he invited Gears into his <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span>- no, not just his <em><span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span></em>, his <em>home</em>, his life. He\u2019s so captivated by Gears, by how far they\u2019ve come to reach this point, that Clef doesn\u2019t even notice what day it is. Well\u2026 no point in reminding himself now, he\u2019s earned a good night.</p>\n<p>The chocolate covered strawberries are <em>perfect</em> with the Sherry. Clef holds one out for Gears, and Gears, perhaps a little drunker than he intended to be, leans in and takes it with his teeth. Clef shudders as Gears\u2019s lips brush against his fingers.</p>\n<p>He mumbles something.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Gears is smiling. He doesn\u2019t even know he\u2019s doing it. He washes down the chocolate and licks his lips and smiles and it all feels and looks so natural. Clef forgets how to think.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he says. \u201cI love you,\u201d he repeats because it didn\u2019t sound right the first time. \u201cI <em>love</em> you.\u201d No, that isn\u2019t right either. It\u2019s just not enough to convey what\u2019s boiling inside of him.\u201cI. <em>I</em> love you. I-\u201d</p>\n<p>Gears presses a finger to Clef\u2019s lips before he can spiral further. \u201cI heard you. I know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gears once wondered if he\u2019d ever understand Clef fully. Clef looks at him with wonder in his eyes, such a love he wasn\u2019t sure what he did to deserve. He realizes, in this moment, that he\u2019s not <em>afraid</em> of Clef anymore, of not understanding Clef\u2019s <em>inscrutable</em> nature. It was no longer a glassy river surface, cracking beneath his feet, waiting to swallow him up. It was\u2026 well, he doesn't know what it is, but he knows it loves him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d he says, breathlessly. Clef\u2019s relaxes, melting.</p>\n<p>Gears rests his head on Clef\u2019s shoulder, and Clef wraps his arm around his waist. They\u2019ve earned this peace.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>3:30 am, Nobody\u2019s <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span>, during the incident:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/going-out-of-book\">Alison Chao</a> walks around her father\u2019s <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span> three times, making note of every window, every wall, every crack in the foundations.

She can see movement in the second story window, and she can hear the yowl of a cat.</p>\n<p>The door is locked, obviously, but there\u2019s infinite Ways into a <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span>, especially one like this. Alison presses her body up against the door, takes in a deep breath, and closes her eyes.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s dark inside, her flashlight doesn\u2019t light up the space in front of her, almost like there\u2019s a black <em>veil</em> before her, blocking out her vision. The floor creaks under foot. It\u2019s cold too, her breath turns into vapor. This place feels <em>alive</em> and <em>scared</em>.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cCan you help me? I\u2019m lost. I think my father\u2019s here.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cHe\u2019s upstairs.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Alison\u2019s heart skips a beat. It\u2019s <em>him</em>. <em>He</em> who Alison has crawled through every tiny crack in the universe to find. He\u2019s right within Alison\u2019s grasp, she could practically brush her fingers against him.</p>\n<p>Her legs shake as she forces herself deeper into the <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span>. Whatever lives within the walls of this place is more <em>intense</em> than anything she\u2019s ever encountered, at least this closely. <em>He\u2019s</em> not safe here, hell, <em>she\u2019s</em> not even safe here, <em>this place</em> isn\u2019t safe here.</p>\n<p>She drags her hand across the wall, using it as an anchor. The wall feels slick and sticky, for her own health she doesn\u2019t shine her light at it. Something crunches under her foot. A glowstick?</p>\n<p>Her fingers find a smooth countertop. Her father was <em>here</em>, just moments before. Her light does little to illuminate her surroundings, but it does help her notice where the counter opens up into another room. Distant voices echo towards her. She crawls over the counter and into-</p>\n<p><em>Pure white.</em></p>\n<p>Her eyes <em>burn</em> from the sudden contrast. Her thin coat is useless against the snow, and pulling her hat over her ears doesn\u2019t block out the roar of the wind. <em>Snow\u2026 why is there snow here?</em> Wherever this is, it\u2019s angry, and its fury pours out like an open wound.</p>\n<p>She drops her flashlight, it wasn\u2019t doing her much good anyway. Her aching fingers twitch towards her reality anchor. <em>Not yet</em>, she commands herself, not until she gets closer.</p>\n<p>A gunshot pierces through the air. Alison stumbles against the winds and drops to her knees. Distantly, she can make out the figure of a man. She wants to scream for him, but her lips are sealed shut.</p>\n<p>The figure moves away from her and suddenly the cold means nothing. She charges forward, gracelessly. Something, or more aptly, <em>someone</em> is lying on the stairs. Her father is just within her grasp.</p>\n<p>She <em>freezes</em>. He\u2019s looking right at her. He can\u2019t see her, of course, but his eyes are trained on the exact spot she stands. She doesn\u2019t dare to move, even as the frost creeps up her skin and around her veins. He looks\u2026 scared. As he travels up the stairwell, out of view, the blizzard stops, all at once.</p>\n<p>Alison doesn\u2019t recognize the body on the staircase. He looks dead, but he also looks like there was never much life in him in the first place. As Alison stands there, lost in a sort of trance, his body shimmers and <em>melts</em>, disappearing into the cracks between the floorboards. She blinks, and she\u2019s standing in the middle of the living room.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a centerpoint to this hole in reality, and it\u2019s moving away from her, towards her father, or, perhaps <em>with</em> her father. She brushes the last, crumbling bits of frost off her coat and takes the first step.</p>\n<p>The stairs go up, and then they go up, and then they continue to go up. Even when she\u2019s sure she\u2019s reached the next floor, they go up. When she\u2019s sure she\u2019s reached well over the height of the <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span>, they go up. The walls groan, the steps creak, and the stairs go up.</p>\n<p>Alison could try and count the steps, which are going up, but she loses track of the numbers. Her mind is focused on what\u2019s waiting for her on the top of these ever upward steps. She\u2019s going to get her father out, guide him <em>down</em> the twisting stairwell. She\u2019s going to <em>win</em>.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cYou thought if you sent me away I wouldn\u2019t find out what you did? You were terrified of me, the perfect token of your guilt, of the promise you failed to keep.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>A moment's pause, followed by a weak sigh. <em>\u201cI did not kill your father.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>She\u2019s close, so close, but something\u2019s wrong.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cYes you did. You may not have put a bullet through his head, but he\u2019s gone because of you. You couldn\u2019t stand to look at me, couldn\u2019t risk that I would pick up on the mold that\u2019s settled in your stomach.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Alison starts running. Her body aches with the effort, her lungs burning with every breath. She takes off her hat, stuffs it in her pocket, and plucks out her reality anchor. It\u2019s warm in her hands.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cI know what you\u2019ve done. You can try and try and try to run and hide, but I know. And you know I know, you know I hate you for what you did. You know that one day, I\u2019ll walk into your office and do this-\u201d</em></p>\n<p>There\u2019s a man on the stairs, or, at least there\u2019s something in the shape of a man on the stairs. It- <em>he</em> presses a gun to her father\u2019s forehead. Alison activates her reality anchor. It feels like the ground has disappeared under her feet. She stumbles, pushing through the nausea, damn near slamming her full weight into her father.</p>\n<p>\u201cDad-!\u201d Oh god, <em>oh god</em>, it\u2019s really him. He feels real under her fingers. She doesn\u2019t have the time or the words to say what she needs to say to him. \u201c-we have to get out of here!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. No! Leave me alone!\u201d His voice sounds wrong, weak and desperate. She can see the white of his bloodshot eyes. \u201cJust go away!\u201d Alison bites her lip until it bleeds.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis place is too dangerous. I know there\u2019s someone you care about in there but you can\u2019t help him! Please, just come with me! My reality anchor is only so strong.\u201d The small, handheld anchor pulses in her hands, like a heartbeat.</p>\n<p>She grabs him, sinking her fingers into his forearm. She\u2019s prepared for this, prepared to drag him kicking and screaming out of the gaping maw that snatched him from her in the first place. She didn\u2019t prepare for the stairs to be so slick, or for him to be so willing to shove her.</p>\n<p>If she thought the feeling of activating the anchor was nauseating then there was no way she would ever be prepared for the <em>fall</em>. It wasn\u2019t like falling down the stairs, it was more like falling down a pit. You fall, and you fall, and there\u2019s nothing to grab onto, not a sign that there\u2019s ever going to be a bottom, that anything will ever catch you</p>\n<p>You just keep going</p>\n<p>D</p>\n<p>O</p>\n<p>W</p>\n<p>N.</p>\n<p>And then the ground crashes into her.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>4:17 am, Nobody\u2019s <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span>, the extraction:</strong></p>\n<p>During this time of year, most people would chalk up Clef's increased irritability to any number of things. Clef was just an asshole, there was no point in psychoanalyzing his ever changing mood.</p>\n<p>Draven didn\u2019t have the same privilege of avoiding Clef whenever his mood spiked. If Draven wasn\u2019t personally doing field training with Clef, Clef was in his home, pretending like he wasn\u2019t madly in love with Draven\u2019s father. Clef was an important, if only a consistent, figure for the last quarter of Draven\u2019s life, and so Draven became intimately aware of the highs and lows of Clef\u2019s mental state, and what to do about it.</p>\n<p>That's why Draven was first to kick down the door to Clef\u2019s <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span>. He <em>has</em> to be first. He <em>has</em> to be there for a Clef</p>\n<p>A corpse lies in a crumpled heap at the bottom of the stairs. No, not a corpse, not yet, she\u2019s still breathing. Not Draven's problem.</p>\n<p>Clef\u2019s upstairs. Draven\u2019s been around him long enough to recognize this feeling. The hazy pressure of reality shifting slightly to the right. Ignoring the shouts from his fellow soldiers, Draven practically leaps over the body to get up the stairs. He <em>has</em> to be the one to get there first, there\u2019s no telling what the others might do if he doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p><em>Shoot first, ask questions later,</em> one of Clef\u2019s favorite things to drill into his student\u2019s little heads. Well Draven has a lot of questions right now, and he\u2019s not going to shoot his mentor. Not Clef, he can\u2019t lose Clef.</p>\n<p>He bursts through the door, using more force than he needs to. The thick, copper stench of blood clogs up his nose. He\u2019s <em>long</em> past the point of being bothered by blood, but seeing it splattered across the walls and seeping out of Clef\u2019s closed eyes leaves him nauseous. <em>Draven should\u2019ve prevented this, should\u2019ve come in sooner, should\u2019ve tried a little harder before he went a blew his fucking brains out-</em></p>\n<p>Draven snaps himself back into focus. Clef is alive. Heavily injured, but alive. <em>The Foundation will fix this, just get him out of here. The Foundation will fix this.</em> He repeats those words over and over in his mind as he worms his arms under Clef\u2019s and hoists him out of bed. <em>Fix Clef, fix Clef, fix Clef, fix dad, fix dad, fix-</em></p>\n<p>Clef\u2019s antlers block half of Draven\u2019s vision, and the sound Clef makes as he is dragged out of bed\u2026 will haunt Draven\u2019s nightmares for the rest of his life, or at least until the Foundation amnestizes him.</p>\n<p>As he settles into autopilot, Draven has to ask where he went wrong. How did this happen without Draven noticing? It\u2019s not fair. <em>None of this is fair.</em></p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>4:36 am, the long stretch between a <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span> and a home:</strong></p>\n<p>Alison wakes up to the feeling of a wet, sandpapery tongue dragging across her cheek. She opens her eyes for all of two seconds before they fall closed. Her anchor pulses near her head, and consciousness evades her.</p>\n<p>The second time she wakes up she\u2019s moving. It\u2019s slow, but her body aches so much it feels agonizing. There\u2019s some talking, but it\u2019s all muffled. One blurry person stays next to her while the rest of the blurry figures run up the stairs. Someone says something that might be directed at her. They never get an answer.</p>\n<p>The third time she wakes up it\u2019s to the yowl of a cat. She opens her eyes in time to see the person in uniform snatch up a cat off her chest. It digs its claws into her chest and screams as it is lifted away.</p>\n<p>\u201cNone of that now,\u201d the guard says, turning his back to Alison. She stands up, using the wall as a crutch. Her head throbs, every movement sending a white hot stab of pain through her head and down her spine.</p>\n<p>The cat squirms out of the guard\u2019s arms, hits the ground face first and scampers out of the open door. The guard spins around, too focused on the cat to immediately notice that Alison is on her feet. They make extended eye contact, a beat passes, and Alison bolts out the door.</p>\n<p>From the perspective of the guard, he picked up a cat that seemed tempted to eat a heavily concussed woman, dropped it, and watched said heavily concussed woman bolt out the door and disappear from view. He would have run after her, but the rest of his teammates come down the stairs with a screaming, bloodied man, and she quickly becomes his last priority.</p>\n<p>Alison\u2019s perspective is similar, but as she gets her hat on, she loses feeling in her legs and collapses in a field across the street from her father\u2019s <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span>. She\u2019s had hundreds of injuries, fucked up a thousand times across a thousand universes, but this one hurts the most.</p>\n<p>That cat is nearby, rolling around the grass. Alison forces herself back to her feet and stalks toward it. It perks up- likely just due to the noise, it shouldn\u2019t be able to see her.</p>\n<p>\u2026 <em>shouldn\u2019t</em> be able to.</p>\n<p>The cat runs. Alison runs too. She doesn\u2019t know if she\u2019s running after the cat or away from Site-19. Neither direction is safe, but if she stops and thinks for too long she might not get up again.</p>\n<p>It feels like he runs for hours, and she just might have, her body fueled by pure adrenaline. The cat leaps through brambles and brushes with about as much grace as she does. Site-19, her father\u2019s house, everything disappears from her view, replaced by a loved cabin.</p>\n<p>She stops, making an active effort not to feel the weight of her body. The cat squirms into the cabin through a cracked window. She goes up the three steps and stands on the patio. The door creaks open without trouble. The house is empty, just a thin layer of dust covering its baren walls and floors.</p>\n<p>This place feels loved. It\u2019s a warm feeling that seeps in and soothes her aching body. It also feels sad and abandoned. A place like this can\u2019t possibly understand why it\u2019s been left alone for so long.</p>\n<p>In the center of this room there\u2019s a displaced floorboard. She approaches, drops to her knees, and pushes it aside. There\u2019s a hole under the <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span>, big enough for a full grown man, occupied by a fat, old cat. The poor thing looks filthy, covered in dried blood, dust, mold, and cobwebs. It looks at her, spit dripping out of its mouth, two different colored eyes seeing her despite her hat.</p>\n<p>She laughs. She\u2019s not sure what sparks it. Maybe it\u2019s because she just noticed the <em>hole</em> in her own mind. She\u2019s spent enough time in the anomalous community to recognize that something\u2019s been taken from her, snatched right out of her psyche.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was so close,\u201d she says to the empty air. \u201cSo close to\u2026 So close\u2026 So fucking close\u2026\u201d She sinks to the floor, breathing in the dust and mold, and laughs.</p>\n<p>She drags herself into the hole and pulls the board over on top.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>4:58 am, a lake in Cornwall, England:</strong></p>\n<p>A fish swims in slow, aimless circles, unbothered by the rising waters.</p>\n<p><strong>8:12 am, Site-19, four hours after the incident:</strong></p>\n<p>Clef isn\u2019t in his office by the time Adams comes in. That\u2019s normal, he\u2019s missed plenty of days and Adams is used to doing work on her own. It was the site director\u2019s job to get onto him for that, not hers.</p>\n<p>What <em>isn\u2019t</em> normal, is the group of armed guards and researchers poking around the cramped space. Did she miss an email?</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here? Where\u2019s Clef?\u201d</p>\n<p>A nerdy little man approaches her. \u201c<em>Ah</em>, Agent Adams. You\u2019ll find Clef in Humanoid Containment. I would suggest you hurry on.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Humanoid containment?</em> Must be some new, poor soul looking to worm their way onto Alpha-9. <em>Seems</em> like something Clef should have discussed with her beforehand, but, well, it is Clef.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t take a genius to put together that Clef isn\u2019t as human as he\u2019d like people to believe. Even knowing that couldn\u2019t have prepared Adams for the state of things in <em>High Security Humanoid Containment</em>.</p>\n<p>The cell is way too small, for one. That\u2019s the first thing Adams becomes viscerally aware of. It\u2019s cramped, claustrophobic, just a miserable little mattress in the corner where a lump in the shape of Clef lays. He\u2019s still, eyes closed, face devoid of any of Clef\u2019s mannerisms.</p>\n<p>He looks dead.</p>\n<p>Even when she gets close enough to see the slow rise and fall of his chest, she can\u2019t shake the feeling of looking at a corpse. It\u2019s almost the <em>opposite</em> of uncanny, this is no longer the false caricature of a man, this is real. The <em>realest</em> she\u2019s ever seen him.</p>\n<p>\u201cDr. Clef?\u201d She feels like a child calling out his name; he\u2019s clearly unconscious. It\u2019s more of a reassurance for herself. <em>Yes, this is doctor Clef I am looking at.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t get too close.\u201d Adams jumps out of her skin. She was so deep in her head she forgot she wasn\u2019t alone in here. A miserable looking boy sits in the corner opposite of Clef. He\u2019s got bags under his eyes and the general vibe of someone who\u2019s way too young to be in this position.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>He shrugs. \u201cComplicated.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cComplicated?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, okay?\u201d He huffs like a dog and slumps back in the corner. \u201cYou\u2019re Agent Adams, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe talks about you sometimes. Only good things, I promise.\u201d His eyes twitch, a tight, professional smile on his face. He\u2019s not here as a guard, he\u2019s here as a friend.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd who are you?\u201d He seems familiar, but Adams is terrible at putting names to faces.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh- Kondraki,\u201d he winces, \u201cDraven Kondraki. Agent- <em>ahem</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh! I knew your father.\u201d <em>Knew</em> being a <em>very</em> strong word, but <em>met once</em> doesn\u2019t roll off the tongue as well. Another wince, his poker face is horrible today.</p>\n<p>\u201cA lot of people did\u2026\u201d he looks ready to fold in on himself when his eyes suddenly widen. Adams turns in time to see Clef\u2019s antlers scrap against the wall.</p>\n<p>He howls. That\u2019s the only word to describe this noise. The walls shudder and creak as grass and flowers force their way between the floor tiles. Vines and flowers coil around the security cameras and Clef\u2019s antlers. Adams hunches over as a coughing fit overtakes her, flower petals spray out of her mouth.</p>\n<p>There was one assignment Adams had before she was assigned as Clef\u2019s assistant and her fate was sealed. She visited a <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span>, in the middle of Cornwall, England. It was incredibly brief, two days if even that, and something that just as quickly faded from memory. But, at this moment, as her lungs fill with vines and plant matter, she\u2019s standing in a dusty old bedroom, propped up on tiptoes, in hopes of catching a glimpse of the manifestation in the surrounding waters over the shoulders of the researcher in her way.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a tiny figure in the lake, made even smaller by the tall woman beside them. And as Adams\u2019s vision blurs and she falls to her knees, all she can think is: <em>it\u2019s him.</em></p>\n<p>But, of course now isn\u2019t the time for reminiscing.</p>\n<p>When the reality anchors come on Adams hits the ground before Clef does. Draven darts past her to grab Clef. Clef vomits, gray water spilling from his lips. Adams reaches into the back of her mouth to yank out a chain of lilies.</p>\n<p><em>What the fuck was that about?</em></p>\n<p>Clef sobs, heavy, disgusting heaves. His lips move but he can\u2019t form any words.</p>\n<p>Adams pulls herself together and scoots to Clef\u2019s other side. Clef\u2019s eyes between her and Draven. He squirms, his antler leaving a thin scratch across Draven\u2019s cheek. Adams backs off, instructing Draven to do the same.</p>\n<p>Something\u2019s different about Clef, besides the obvious. It\u2019s hard to describe, but it reminds Adams of several months ago when Clef passed out in the middle of the hallway. This isn\u2019t Clef, not entirely.</p>\n<p>Clef wheezes, clawing at his throat and chest, leaving red lines across his skin. They both grab a wrist before he can damage himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cBreathe!\u201d Adams commands, rather dumbly.</p>\n<p>Clef looks at her for a long time before promptly passing out. They lay him on the sad slab the Foundation calls a bed. Neither says a word.</p>\n<p>Adams and Draven spend the next two days in that tiny, soundproof cell.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>8:46 am, Humanoid Containment, two days after the incident:</strong></p>\n<p>Clef stares at the antlers on the ground, expression unreadable. Adams wants to tear into him, but she\u2019s tired. Everyone\u2019s tired. A metal tray sits in between the three of them. Three syringes, three doses of amnestics.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you <em>fucking</em> serious?\u201d Adams isn\u2019t sure who she\u2019s asking. \u201cThis is- <em>bullshit!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef <em>tsks</em>. He looks like shit, not that Adams has any right to say that. \u201cSite director\u2019s orders,\u201d some of the first noises that have come from him that aren\u2019t pained whimpers.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s just get this over with, okay?\u201d Draven picks up his syringe, as does Clef.</p>\n<p>They both stare at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to know why this is necessary. What about all the others observing us? Why does <em>he</em> have to take it too, huh?\u201d She gestures to Clef.</p>\n<p>\u201cAdams.\u201d The weakness in his voice makes Adams sick to her stomach. Where\u2019s the force? The bite? Instead, all she gets is shame. This isn\u2019t how she wants to remember him.</p>\n<p>She takes her syringe. Clef waits to stick himself for both of them to finish.</p>\n<p>He may get to forget the worst few nights of his life, but he doesn\u2019t get the same benefit of forgetting everything. Even as the amnestics course through his veins, he knows <em>nothing\u2019s going back to normal.</em></p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>7:20\u00a0pm, Kain \u201cPathos\u201d Crow\u2019s office, four months after the incident:</strong></p>\n<p>Kain is a very lucky man, if it's right to still describe him as such. He is lucky that, in spite of his situation, and the numerous <em>problems</em> he\u2019s created for the Foundation, that he\u2019s still useful enough to be kept alive.</p>\n<p>His old bones don\u2019t move as well as they used to. For all the intelligence he has, he never could put himself back together properly. Something he\u2019s learned to live with, and will soon learn to die with.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s another person in his office. His body may be frail, but his senses are just as strong as they\u2019ve always been. No, it wouldn\u2019t be right to say there\u2019s someone else in his office. There\u2019s a space where a person <em>should</em> be.</p>\n<p>This absence comes and goes. Kain can always tell when it\u2019s left recently. The office will be a little cleaner, the many machines he\u2019s made to keep himself going will be freshly oiled, and he\u2019ll feel a pit in his stomach and a hole in his mind.

She usually took care not to look too closely at anything meant for her Founder, but something caught her eye.</p>\n<p>\u201cFounder, sir?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm?\u201d He grunts, casting his sharp eyes on her. She shrinks.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho is the Director of Site-19?\u201d</p>\n<p>He squints, eyebrows furrowed, and when he fails to produce a name he grunts and slams his fist against the table. \u201cIt\u2019s not my responsibility to keep track of every employee here!\u201d</p>\n<p>She swallows a lump in her throat. \u201cI just wanted to ask because there\u2019s a name here- right here, but I can\u2019t quite\u2026 read it?\u201d The longer she stares at it the less sense it makes in her mind.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid I tell you to read my reports?\u201d</p>\n<p>She steels herself, standing up straight. \u201cNo sir. No, I\u2019m sorry sir, you\u2019re right, I shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d She quickly backs out of Founder's office, mentally punching herself. She\u2019s worked here longer than most people have been alive, she should know better than this.</p>\n<p>Founder shakes his head as she leaves, lips tightly pursed. Slowly, almost like he didn\u2019t intend to, he drops his pen and grabs the report. He looks at the dotted line where the site director\u2019s name should be.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a hole in his mind, but why should he care if <em>Nobody</em> runs Site-19? As long as everything else is in order, it\u2019s not his problem.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>5:17\u00a0pm, <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span> in the woods, ten years before <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/yesterday\">the world ends</a>:</strong></p>\n<p>A man steps out of his home and sits on a creaky rocking chair. He\u2019s got a knife in one hand and a small loaf of bread in the other. He slices off the moldy crust and tears the bread apart with his fingers.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s late, at least it feels late. The sun is sinking, painting the trees gold and red. He\u2019s tired. He barely sleeps these days, so every waking moment feels like he\u2019s ready to go back to bed.</p>\n<p>His appearance has changed a lot in the past couple of years. His hair is especially long, nearly reaching his hips. He\u2019s long since given up on keeping it clean. His clothes are ratty, not exactly a washing machine down here, meaning he either has to steal clean clothes or make them. Though, he hasn\u2019t quite starved off his beer belly.</p>\n<p>A shotgun leans up against the wall next to him, probably the most well cared for thing he has anymore. Underneath the porch there\u2019s a jar full of dead butterflies, buried in the ground. He wishes they could\u2019ve had a better burial, but he has more important things to regret.</p>\n<p>He feels a hole tear in his mind. He won\u2019t realize the hole is there, but he feels its presence. There\u2019s a reason he\u2019s sitting out here instead of in a box, a person who helped him out. He remembers a person there, remembers how they helped him, but for the life of him he can not put a face to these memories.</p>\n<p>He remembers Clef, the last words he said to Clef, and his stomach aches. There\u2019s a mold settled inside of him, it\u2019s been there for years, dormant but alive.</p>\n<p>It begins to stir.</p>\n<div class=\"series-nav\">\n<p>\u00ab <strong><a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/lets-get-you-home\">Part 1</a></strong> | <strong><a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/i-need-you-to-leave\">Part 2</a></strong> | <strong><a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/this-is-not-a-place-of-honor\">Part 3</a></strong> | <strong>Part 4</strong> <em>(you are here)</em> | <strong><a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/tomorrow-and-tomorrow-and-tomorrow\">Finale</a></strong> \u00bb</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/nobody-runs-site-19\">Nobody Runs Site-19</a>\" by kingofmice, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Kondraki is out of bed and on the floor in seconds, except the floor isn\u2019t as flat as he remembers and the walls are squeezing in on him and the very [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]] feels alive and hungry. \n\n\n\nClef is writhing on the bed, clutching his head as antlers attempt to tear through his skull. Three parallel cuts appear on his back as if an invisible paw took a swipe at him. Any thoughts Kondraki had were immediately replaced with the need to protect. \n\n\n\nKondraki kneels on the bed, reaching over Clef to flip on the lamp. He throws the blankets aside and takes Clef in his arms. Clef tenses and then goes limp. His breathing is heavy and sharp. \n\n\n\n\u201c[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4231 I am telling the truth]. I am telling the truth\u2026\u201d he mumbles between painful gasps. \n\n\n\n\u201cI know. I believe you.\u201d \n\n\n\nClef chokes on his own snot and mucus. Kondraki holds him even as his blood soaks into his clothes and it feels like the bed is trying to eat him. Ignoring everything else around him, he rocks Clef back and forth. \n\n\n\nClef can\u2019t see, can\u2019t breathe. He\u2019s drowning, the lake is rising, boiling. He\u2019s running up stairs that don\u2019t stop, don\u2019t end, impossibly tall. He can\u2019t breathe, water fills the [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]]. He holds his daughter above the murky surface but it\u2019s not enough, the water is faster than him, the [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]] is unrelenting. //It doesn\u2019t stop it doesn\u2019t stop it doesn\u2019t stop it doesn\u2019t stop-//\n\n\n\nClef opens his three, beady eyes. He squirms, nearly smacking Kondraki with his newly formed antlers. Kondraki tries to look comforting but it comes out more panicked. \n\n\n\n\u201cCan you hear me?\u201d \n\n\n\nClef can\u2019t speak, can\u2019t breathe, his mouth too full of lake water and mold. He spits up on Kondraki\u2019s shirt. He wants to scream, to beg for mercy. He //is// telling the truth, he //is// telling the- \n\n\n\nCarefully, with a grace he did not possess, Kondraki drags Clef from the bed and into the bathroom. Clef vomits into the toilet while Kondraki runs a washcloth under warm water and cleans up the blood. Clef can\u2019t quite look at him, can\u2019t quite focus on anything. \n\n\n\nKondraki drops to Clef's side, pressing the warm cloth into the fresh cuts on his cheek. Clef doesn\u2019t move, too scared to. He sucks in a sharp breath as the cloth runs down his neck. He breaks out into weak sobs, just a quivering mess on his bathroom floor. \n\n\n\nLogically speaking, he knows exactly where he is. He\u2019s in his home, a twenty minute drive from Site-19. He\u2019s with Kondraki. He //trusts// Kondraki, whatever trust means these days. He\u2019s safe here. \n\n\n\nAt the same time, over a thousand miles away, he\u2019s also in an abandoned [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]]. He\u2019s still curled under the floorboards, breathing in the mold and dust, waiting for //her// to find him. For a moment, the man in the floorboards woke up, and Clef felt his terror. \n\n\n\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Kondraki asks, sounding distant. \n\n\n\nClef nods, still not quite able to look at him. \n\n\n\nKondraki takes a cup from their nightstand and fills it with water. Clef drinks it- or tries to, most of it ends up on his chest. \n\n\n\n\u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d \n\n\n\nClef shakes his head. He\u2019s not sure if he even can talk right now. The antlers are gone, and the cuts are closed, if still sore. Kondraki takes Clef\u2019s hands and Clef leans in, resting his head on Kondraki\u2019s chest. \n\n\n\n\u201cDo you want to watch a movie?\u201d Clef had a couple of movies downloaded on his laptop that he liked to watch after moments like this. He nods. \n\n\n\nKondraki helps Clef to his feet, supporting him on their back back to their bedroom. Kondraki wraps the blanket around them, setting the laptop between them. They watch //Animal [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]House[[/span]]//and Clef lets himself forget whatever had him scared. \n\n\n\nHe watches Kondraki sink into the bed, forcing his eyes open every couple of seconds before giving up and passing out. Clef drags the back of his knuckles against Kondraki\u2019s scratchy beard. The laptop is put away.\n\n\n\nThis feels right. Clef is safe here. He\u2019s earned this security, nothing can take this away from him. \n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**9:16 pm, Clef\u2019s office, two hours after [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-king-is-dead Kondraki\u2019s death]:**\n\n\n\n\n\nDraven finds Clef on the floor of his office, stinking of beer and vomit. There\u2019s something so sickly familiar about this position. //God//, how many times did he find his own father in this exact situation? Passed out in a pool of alcohol and his own filth? It even smells like the same brand. \n\n\n\nHe drops to one knee by Clef\u2019s side. \u201cClef?\u201d Clef lets out a soft groan, curling in on himself. \u201cAlto?\u201d Draven says, softer, laying a hand on Clef\u2019s side. Clef flinches. Draven scoots in closer, gently leaning on him. \n\n\n\n\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t let me see him,\u201d Draven says. \u201cI guess I don't need to see it for myself to know what happened\u2026\u201d He\u2019s imagined this scenario a thousand times, he can picture his father\u2019s corpse with photographic clarity. \n\n\n\nClef mumbles something. \n\n\n\n\u201cHm?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t save him\u2026\u201d Upon closer inspection, Clef is wrapped around a ratty jacket, a green butterfly wing pinched between his knuckles. His father\u2019s jacket. Draven swallows a lump in his throat. \n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn't your responsibility to save him.\u201d \n\n\n\nDraven won\u2019t claim to know all the intricacies of the relationship between his father and his mentor. Frankly, he doesn\u2019t want to. But he did, over the course of several years, watch Clef go from //\u201cthat ugly bastard\u201d// to //\u201cmy coworker\u201d// to //\u201cDr. Clef\u201d// to //\u201cmy friend\u201d// and then finally to //\u201cAlto\u201d//. It was Clef who took care of his father when Draven wasn\u2019t there, and for that Draven could only be grateful\u2026 \n\n\n\nHe wishes he could say he was surprised to hear that his father shot himself. But that\u2019s not true. His father was never a stable man. This made perfect sense. Anyone could\u2019ve seen it coming. \n\n\n\nDraven isn\u2019t sure what he\u2019s feeling right now\u2026 //Hungry//. He\u2019s feeling hungry. Hunger is a feeling he can understand, something he can satiate. \n\n\n\n\u201cClef?... Let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d Draven stands and watches Clef lay there for several moments. Finally, Clef drags himself off the floor. He won\u2019t look Draven in the eyes. Whatever, emotions to deal with later. \n\n\n\nHe loops an arm under Clef\u2019s shoulder and they walk in unsteady tandem. Draven remembers the hushed whispers as they pass, the prying eyes, the feeling that creeps in his veins. He remembers passing by the site director\u2019s office, catching a whiff of blood, and swallowing the vomit in his mouth.\n\n\n\nHe doesn\u2019t remember, as he drags Clef into the parking lot, making eye contact with the site director. He doesn\u2019t remember how the site director\u2019s eyes fill with momentary fear. He doesn\u2019t remember the site director walking away, tense. He doesn\u2019t even remember //who// the site director is. \n\n\n\nThere\u2019s mold growing in Clef\u2019s sink. Draven takes the time to wash Clef\u2019s dishes while Clef stares off into space at the table. He jumps as something brushes up against his leg. He leans down to pat L.S.\u2019s head, getting soap on its sunken face.\n\n\n\nHe makes food, using whatever he can find in Clef\u2019s cabinets. It\u2019s the least he can do, in his mind. Draven knows once he\u2019s done eating he\u2019ll be forced to feel everything he\u2019s choosing not to. He knows when it\u2019s time to put his father in the ground he\u2019ll break. He knows it\u2019s coming. But not yet, he won\u2019t let himself break yet. \n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**12:47 am, [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/lets-get-you-home The Bitter End], one year and seven months after Kondraki\u2019s death:**\n\n\n\n\n\nJonathan Tucker did not like calling the cops on people. He worked the late shift at a bar outside of town, it was practically in his job description that he is expected to deal with dangerous, intoxicated people. Still, even if it meant he would be stuck here way past closing, he\u2019d rather exhaust all other options before that.\n\n\n\n\u201cIs there someone I can call for you? Someone you trust?\u201d He asks the red faced man at the counter. \n\n\n\n\u201cHehe- //sure//. You got a- a fucking //ouija board// back there?\u201d The man laughs; it sounds like nails against a chalkboard. Tucker puts his head in his hands. \n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not serving you any more drinks. We\u2019re closed. Please either leave quietly or I\u2019ll have to call the police.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cCall the cops!

Tucker is reaching for the phone when the door creaks open. \n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re closed?\u201d Looking back on it, Tucker can\u2019t describe what the new stranger looks like. He looks clean, out of place in a run down place like this. Tucker almost wants to apologize for the sorry state of this place. \n\n\n\nThe clean man speaks. Tucker can\u2019t remember exactly what he says, but he thinks that at one point he\u2019s asked his name. The man leans over the moldy counter and writes two checks. Tucker\u2019s stomach drops as he reads the one written for him. That\u2019s more than triple the tips he\u2019s received since he got this job. \n\n\n\n\u201cHave a good night, sir!\u201d He waves the two men off, heart pounding in his chest.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is kidnapping!\u201d The drunkard screams, \u201cYou\u2019re letting this guy kidnap me!\u201d Tucker ignores him. He sees this type of behavior a lot and he\u2019s not willing to consider this situation more than he has to. \n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**1:09 am, [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/self-similar |Nobody\u2019s bedroom]]], three months before Nobody smashes a bottle over Clef\u2019s head:**\n\n\n\n\n\nNobody is lying in bed when the door creaks open. He doesn\u2019t move, pretending to sleep. Clef creeps up next to him, closing the door behind him. Nobody can\u2019t see the expression Clef is making, he doesn\u2019t have to. \n\n\n\nClef walks around the bed and crawls under the covers, his chest to Nobody\u2019s back. Nobody chews his lip, tearing off layers of skin. Clef is warm, a little radiator. Nobody wants to get closer, wants to hold Clef like they love each other. That\u2019s what Clef is offering. \n\n\n\nHe can\u2019t, though. He\u2019s //frozen// to the spot. Clef can close his eyes and pretend that he\u2019s in bed with Kondraki, but Nobody doesn\u2019t get that privilege. He doesn\u2019t have false love to project onto Clef. He doesn\u2019t want to be Kondraki\u2019s //replacement//. \n\n\n\nHe made a promise to keep Clef safe. That\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t scream when Clef gets into his bed, that\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t elbow him in the face as he scoots closer, that\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t cry as Clef snuggles up and brushes his cheek against Nobody\u2019s neck. \n\n\n\nIceberg stands in the corner of the room, just out of Nobody\u2019s vision. Nobody can feel him there. Clef holds him close and Nobody tries very hard not to feel cold. \n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**8:53 pm, Nobody\u2019s kitchen, five seconds after Nobody smashed a bottle over Clef\u2019s head:**\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t you just be good?\u201d Gears gasps, desperation and fury crawling into his voice. \u201cAm I not kind to you? Have I not cared for you?\u201d He drops the bottle, letting it clang against the floor.\n\n\n\nClef can\u2019t move, can\u2019t breathe, can\u2019t speak. Blood pours into his face. It feels //good// when Gears attacks him, a split moment of pure bliss. And then the moment passes and he\u2019s just standing there, Gears red faced and panting over him. \n\n\n\nAt this moment, more than anything, Clef wants to kiss him. He wants to wrap his arms around Gears\u2019s waist and pull him in. He //needs// Gears to pin him to the counter top and lock their lips while he //guts// him with the broken shards. \n\n\n\nGears storms off. A door slams. L.S. skitters into the kitchen, claws tapping against the tile. Clef just stands there, eyes locked on the place where Gears should be. His head throbs, takes a hell of a swing to break a beer bottle like that. \n\n\n\nHe drags himself from the kitchen into the bathroom just to stare at himself in the mirror. Cold water pours from the faucet, Clef forces his head under the spout. It feels nice for a moment. He tries to fix up his hair only to slice his palm on a shard. He should go to the doctor. \n\n\n\nFor a moment, he stands in front of Gears\u2019s door. He should say something\u2026 \n\n\n\nThe cold outside air makes his head throb even more. He sits in his truck, running his fingers over the leather steering wheel. The truck sputters to life. Clef wonders how far he could get in his thing, he could stop to get gas and just //go// until he\u2019s far, far, far away from this damned [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]]. \n\n\n\nNo one at Site-19 gives him a second look. //Of course, that\u2019s just Dr. Clef, he\u2019s always walking around soaked in blood.// He sits his ass in the nurse's office and waits. \n\n\n\nThe nurse picks out each piece of glass, wraps up his head, asks him a few questions. Clef resists the urge to tell her to fuck off, he doesn\u2019t //have// to explain shit, doesn\u2019t //want// to either. She gives him a packet of paperwork and leaves him alone. \n\n\n\nSlipped in between the standard paperwork is a card. //Domestic Abuse Hotline.// Clef almost laughs. God, what a //punchline//, really caught him off guard. He crumbles the card in his fist and throws it on the ground. \n\n\n\nEven if this was //domestic abuse//, which it isn\u2019t, not to him, what\u2019s some veiled hotline gonna do for someone who legally doesn\u2019t exist? What\u2019s any hotline gonna do against someone like Gears? It\u2019s just a bad joke, something to keep up appearances rather than help anyone. Clef steps on the crumpled ball on his way out.\n\n\n\nHe returns home. //Home//\u2026 is that what he\u2019s calling Gears\u2019s [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]] now? He lets himself in, locking the door behind him. There\u2019s a glass of water sitting on his nightstand, which he appreciates. Maybe an olive branch. \n\n\n\nL.S. curls up in his bed as he drifts off to sleep. \n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**10:56 am, Site-19, two months before Clef has a mental breakdown in front of Adams:**\n\n\n\n\n\nClef\u2019s drop in energy is sudden. Anyone who works with him saw it, the bags under his eyes, the weakness in his smile, the way he would start sentences and then drift off, losing his train of thought. Adams would often find him face down in his desk, completely unresponsive. \n\n\n\nAt first Adams wondered what she had done to earn this blessing. Clef no longer made his weird, sexually charged comments, no longer rambled to her for hours, no longer //spoke// at all. She is finally free to do what //she// wants. \n\n\n\nAnd then the silence gets to her. \n\n\n\nIt feels wrong to walk by Clef\u2019s side in complete silence. The coffee in his hand isn\u2019t doing anything for him. Adams feels antsy, like a zoo animal without enrichment, pacing around her cage. \n\n\n\n\u201cSir\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\nHe perks up. \u201cHm?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201c... Did you know Britain's oldest woman turned one hundred and fourteen today?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cWhy would I give a shit about that?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cJust thought you might want to know, given your age.\u201d A grunt, good, she continues, \u201cShe claimed her age was because of a long walk she took every night. When she was asked if she was concerned about the increase in muggings in recent years, she said that she was not, and would continue mugging people as long as her health holds out.\u201d \n\n\n\nClef blinks slowly, Adams can see the cogs turning behind his eyes. A grin slowly spreads across his face. \u201c//Adams//,\u201d he says, aghast. \u201cDid you just //dad joke// me?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cDid I?\u201d \n\n\n\nClef shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed in you. I know you can do better than that.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cGuess I only have a poor teacher to blame.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cOh you\u2019re //bad// today. Okay, I\u2019ll give you one better.\u201d He cracks his knuckles and takes a long gulp of coffee. Adams mentally braces herself for the worst joke in human history. \u201cSo a man and his wife are at a restaurant, and the husband keeps\u2026 He keeps staring at- there\u2019s this woman at the other end of the\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\nClef stops in his tracks. The mug slips from his hand. Adams has all of three seconds to snatch him by the shirt before he hits the ground. Arms shaking, she slowly lays him down. \n\n\n\n\u201cThis is Agent Adams, I\u2019m on floor twenty-four B. Dr. Clef has just collapsed. He\u2019s unresponsive. Over,\u201d she says into her comms device. Clef doesn\u2019t stir. It\u2019s uncanny seeing him like this. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cAre you serious? Alright, sending a few men your way. Did he show any signs of injury or sickness before collapsing?\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNo- well yes? Kinda?\u201d There\u2019s not a good way to say she\u2019s been regularly letting him pass out at work. \u201cHe\u2019s seemed a little sick lately, but this is the first time he\u2019s just- dropped.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cUnderstood. I\u2019ll contact the site director, let him know what happened.\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOkay, thank you.\u201d \n\n\n\nThree guards in uniform show up and lug Clef down to the hospital wing. Adams is told to return to work, but she sticks around, eavesdropping in on two nurses. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cYeah, apparently he came in a couple weeks ago, middle of the night, glass and shit sticking out of his head. Wouldn\u2019t tell Vesta anything. I mean what are we supposed to do? Tell a guy who kills for fun to stay out of bar fights?\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cYou think a head injury could\u2019ve knocked something loose? Gave him a stroke?\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cI doubt it. Looks to me like he just took too much sleeping medication. Same thing kept happening a couple years ago when the Foundation was prescribing everyone those amnestics. Besides, I think a brain injury might improve his health.\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\nThe nurses go silent as Clef drags himself out of the hospital room. His face is pulled in a tight scowl. \n\n\n\n\u201cHey! You can\u2019t just leave!\u201d \n\n\n\nClef flips her off and storms out. Adams catches him in the hallway.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you! You- you //freaked me out// back there.\u201d \n\n\n\nClef bears his teeth. His cheeks are red, that flush spreading up to his ears. He opens his mouth, as if to speak, only to close it, grind his teeth, and push her out of the way. Adam trails him to his office. \n\n\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re just not going to talk to me? What\u2019s going on with you?\u201d \n\n\n\nHe sits at his desk and puts his head in his hands. His entire demeanor shifts. Adams blinks and for a moment she thinks she\u2019s talking to a whole different person. Clef sucks in an audible, shuddering gasp.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d She meant it to come out a little firmer than that. \n\n\n\nHe shakes his head. \n\n\n\n\u201cAre you really not going to talk to me?\u201d \n\n\n\nNo response. Adams chews on her nail. \n\n\n\n\u201cIs it that you //won\u2019t// talk to me or //can\u2019t//?\u201d \n\n\n\nClef slowly drags a pad of sticky notes across the desk and scribbles down //can\u2019t//. Adams sits down, twitching with nervous energy. \n\n\n\n\u201cOkay then\u2026 Why not?\u201d \n\n\n\nA shrug. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d\n\n\n\nAnother shrug. \n\n\n\n\u201cDoes this happen often?\u201d \n\n\n\nClef thinks for a moment before writing: //It\u2019s not supposed to.//\n\n\n\nAlright, okay, so your boss has passed out and is now nonverbal at work. They don\u2019t put these types of situations in the training booklets. \n\n\n\n\u201cCan I\u2026 help you?\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//Just shut up about it. Don\u2019t tell anyone.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFine. Fuck me for giving a shit about you.\u201d\n\n\n\nClef grips his pen and scribbles something, and just as quickly scratches it out. He puts his head on his desk and huffs. He looks like an old dog. \n\n\n\nThen, something else enters. Adams can\u2019t remember who, but Clef straightens up in his seat and Adams follows suit. She remembers feeling afraid, and that\u2019s not something she\u2019s accustomed to. \n\n\n\nThe person says a few words, asks a few questions, Clef responds with nothing. He looks defeated, and Adams thinks this is something she\u2019s not supposed to see. Even when the person leaves, the tension in his features remains. \n\n\n\nThey don\u2019t talk about it. There\u2019s nothing to talk about at all. \n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**7:35 am, Clef\u2019s office, two days after Clef had a mental breakdown in front of Adams:**\n\n\n\n\n\nAdams can forget about what happened. Clef doesn\u2019t exactly have a reputation for being a stable person; it was only a matter of time until this place got to him in a way she could see. \n\n\n\nWhen he returns from work, two days after locking her in a closet and talking to\u2026 seemingly Nobody, she\u2019s ready to brush it under the carpet. Everyone\u2019s boss starts screaming at the walls occasionally, water under the bridge. \n\n\n\nThat\u2019s until Clef\u2019s apologizes. \n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says, looking her right in the eyes, \u201cthat you had to see what happened the other night. Wasn\u2019t in my right mind.\u201d \n\n\n\nThere\u2019s no joke, no prank, no code, nothing she could expect from Clef. Just a soft, genuine apology, and he moves on with his work. \n\n\n\nThat\u2019s when Adams realizes something is //horribly// wrong. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//But what can she do about it?//\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**12:37 am, Site-19, three hours before the incident:**\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cKondraki!\u201d \n\n\n\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/portraits-of-your-father Draven] jolts awake. He\u2019s in the back of a helicopter, which is now on a landing pad behind Site-19. He gathers up his bag and MTF helmet and steps off, thanking the pilot as he leaves. \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s been a long time since he\u2019s been to Site-19, a couple of months at least, maybe a year. He hasn\u2019t been back since the site director transferred him away\u2026 //who is the site director anyway?//\n\n\n\nDespite the time, Draven finds his way to his old dorm with muscle memory. He sets his stuff down on the stiff cot and slides his phone out of his pocket. It\u2019s the middle of the night and his last message is still unread, but he texts Clef anyway. \n\n\n\nAfter his father\u2019s death, Draven spoke to Clef a lot. It was nice, not having to mourn by himself. And when Draven was transferred out, they tried to call or text everyday. \n\n\n\nAnd then Clef stopped answering calls. He rarely responded to messages, usually only at sporadic times and never answering Draven\u2019s questions. Draven, to his horror, felt another important person slipping from his grasp. \n\n\n\nThis time of year is difficult for Clef, Draven knows that even if, like most things, he doesn\u2019t know the full context. Offering Clef some support is the least Draven can do for him. \n\n\n\nDraven lays down on the mold stained sheets and stares at the ceiling. He\u2019s not getting any sleep, is he? Damn. \n\n\n\nHe stands, spending an hour tidying up the dorm. Even if he won\u2019t be here long, the next person will appreciate the effort. Then he makes his way down to the cafeteria, making light conversation with the other night shift workers. Feels like home. \n\n\n\nEventually, the boredom hits. He still hasn\u2019t gotten a response on any of his messages. It would definitely be rude to just show up at Clef\u2019s [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]] at this hour, but in Draven\u2019s defense, he did try to warn him. If he still has a key to Clef\u2019s [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]] he can just let himself in, because that\u2019ll go down well.\n\n\n\n\u201cCan I borrow a car? Or a bike?\u201d Draven asks, eyeing up the lot of Foundation vehicles. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cWhere the hell do you wanna go at this hour?\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you need to know, I want to visit Dr. Clef.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cYou know you could just- walk over there, right?\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cHe lives just over- what the fuck?\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\nDraven turns around just in time to see a [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]] shoot up into the sky.

He looks good, better than good, he looks healthy. No longer the closed off, painfully skinny, lonely man Clef fell for //oh// so long ago. \n\n\n\nGears twirls a knife in his hand and with precise, practiced motions, cuts a bag of onions into even slices, and then those slices into even squares. He slides a cold bottle of Sherry towards Clef, something to deglaze the pan before they caramelize the onions. Clef pops off the cap and puts the bottle to his lips, savoring the sweetly sticky drink. Gears sighs, fondly. \n\n\n\n\u201cPlease take care to not cook drunk,\u201d he requests softly. \n\n\n\nClef laughs. \u201cRight, right. Got a little ahead of myself there. Good thing I did, though. //Way// too sweet for this dish. I mean try it.\u201d He holds to bottle up, jamming it into Gears\u2019s face. Hesitantly, Gears takes a sip, letting Clef tip the bottle into his mouth. He lets it rest on his tongue for a moment. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, far too sweet. Would be more fitting for a dessert.\u201d He slides his tongue across his teeth. \n\n\n\nClef waves a finger at him. \u201cSee? This is why you taste a little bit of everything.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cApologies for grabbing the wrong wine.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t apologize to me, you know I don\u2019t like that. Besides, we can always run and get another bottle. No harm, no foul.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a bit cold out\u2026 Are you sure you want to head out at this hour?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Clef looks out the window. It is getting dark out, a thin layer of snow on the ground. He looks at Kondraki\u2019s- at //his// coat hanging up next to the door. \u201cI\u2019m sure I could\u2026 get someone to deliver it here. Hold on.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While Clef works on ordering a new bottle, Gears makes a beef broth for the soup. The broth is made completely from scratch, of course. Clef can\u2019t help but be captivated as Gears works. To think, only a few months ago, it was Gears marveling as Clef showed him how a similar, smaller batch he made turned completely solid and almost gelatinous when chilled, a proper bone broth.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0//You\u2019re beautiful,// Clef doesn\u2019t say, but he thinks it. He thinks it as a smile pulls on Gears\u2019s lips, an absent, unconscious little motion. His mind elsewhere as he stirs spices into the broth. It smells great. Clef stands uselessly, leaning against the counter, only watching while Gears works.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So lost in thought, Clef doesn\u2019t realize how much time passes until there\u2019s a knock on the door. He shows his ID to the delivery boy, returning to the kitchen with a bit of frost on his hat, a fresh bottle of Sherry, dark chocolate, and strawberries. The too-sweet Sherry will go well with that, he thinks.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With the fresh bottle, Clef begins to caramelize the onions. Gears flips through a cookbook. It\u2019s not one Clef bought him. \n\n\n\n\u201c\u2018S that new?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cHm? Oh this, yes it\u2019s new. I saw it at the store this morning while shopping.\u201d Gears runs his fingers along the smooth, unblemished pages. \u201cI haven't gotten a chance to read through it in its entirety, but it\u2019s quite fascinating. It discusses much of the science behind cooking!\u201d Gears slides easily into discussion. Clef nods along, even if he\u2019s not quite sure what a //centrifuge// is or what it has to do with cooking. \n\n\n\nThe onions join the broth. Gears slices up a baguette, slathering each piece in butter and herbs, lining those up on a tray for the oven. Clef sorts through his fridge for the gruy\u00e8re cheese. Took him ages to find a quality block. \n\n\n\n//\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just grab a different type of cheese?\u201d Lament asked when Clef was complaining about this exact thing to Gears. Clef was about to tear Lament a new one when Gears caught both of them off guard, standing up for Clef\u2019s honor.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cEvery type of cheese is different in both make-up, texture, and flavor. Simply attempting to swap one cheese for another could throw off an entire dish.\u201d He said it in his usual calm, flat voice, but Clef could see the light in his eyes. The passion growing inside of him. He looked so alive, he looks so alive right now.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gears sips the soup out of a ladle- it\u2019s the blue one Clef bought because it looks like a dinosaur. Gears reaches into the spice cabinet for the thyme, his sweater rides up a bit. Clef nearly slices his hand open on the cheese grater when he catches a glimpse of Gears\u2019s stomach. \n\n\n\nClef ladles the soup into ramekins, and tops it with one of the toasted crostini and a heap of freshly shredded gruy\u00e8re. They set it in the oven to broil, and watch intently as the cheese bubbles, blisters, and browns. Clef removes it with an oven glove.\n\n\n\nThey sit across from each other and eat. It\u2019s comfortable, nearly silent. The only sound being Clef\u2019s slurping and Gears\u2019s soft hums of content. It\u2019s perfect, not just the soup but //this//. Gears //is// perfect. \n\n\n\nOnce they finish, Gears gathers up the dishes for the sink. He decides he can wash those later, Clef is waiting for him on the couch, putting on a show for the both of them. Clef pours two glasses of the too-sweet Sherry and they toast to each other. \n\n\n\nClef is so very happy he invited Gears into his [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]]- no, not just his //[[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]]//, his //home//, his life. He\u2019s so captivated by Gears, by how far they\u2019ve come to reach this point, that Clef doesn\u2019t even notice what day it is. Well\u2026 no point in reminding himself now, he\u2019s earned a good night. \n\n\n\nThe chocolate covered strawberries are //perfect// with the Sherry. Clef holds one out for Gears, and Gears, perhaps a little drunker than he intended to be, leans in and takes it with his teeth. Clef shudders as Gears\u2019s lips brush against his fingers. \n\n\n\nHe mumbles something. \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Gears is smiling. He doesn\u2019t even know he\u2019s doing it. He washes down the chocolate and licks his lips and smiles and it all feels and looks so natural. Clef forgets how to think. \n\n\n\n\u201cI love you,\u201d he says. \u201cI love you,\u201d he repeats because it didn\u2019t sound right the first time. \u201cI //love// you.\u201d No, that isn\u2019t right either. It\u2019s just not enough to convey what\u2019s boiling inside of him.\u201cI. //I// love you. I-\u201d \n\n\n\nGears presses a finger to Clef\u2019s lips before he can spiral further. \u201cI heard you. I know.\u201d \n\n\n\nGears once wondered if he\u2019d ever understand Clef fully. Clef looks at him with wonder in his eyes, such a love he wasn\u2019t sure what he did to deserve. He realizes, in this moment, that he\u2019s not //afraid// of Clef anymore, of not understanding Clef\u2019s //inscrutable// nature. It was no longer a glassy river surface, cracking beneath his feet, waiting to swallow him up. It was\u2026 well, he doesn't know what it is, but he knows it loves him. \n\n\n\n\u201cI love you too,\u201d he says, breathlessly. Clef\u2019s relaxes, melting. \n\n\n\nGears rests his head on Clef\u2019s shoulder, and Clef wraps his arm around his waist. They\u2019ve earned this peace.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**3:30 am, Nobody\u2019s [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]], during the incident:**\n\n\n\n\n\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/going-out-of-book Alison Chao] walks around her father\u2019s [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]] three times, making note of every window, every wall, every crack in the foundations.

He\u2019s right within Alison\u2019s grasp, she could practically brush her fingers against him. \n\n\n\n\u00a0Her legs shake as she forces herself deeper into the [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]]. Whatever lives within the walls of this place is more //intense// than anything she\u2019s ever encountered, at least this closely. //He\u2019s// not safe here, hell, //she\u2019s// not even safe here, //this place// isn\u2019t safe here. \n\n\n\nShe drags her hand across the wall, using it as an anchor. The wall feels slick and sticky, for her own health she doesn\u2019t shine her light at it. Something crunches under her foot. A glowstick? \n\n\n\nHer fingers find a smooth countertop. Her father was //here//, just moments before. Her light does little to illuminate her surroundings, but it does help her notice where the counter opens up into another room. Distant voices echo towards her. She crawls over the counter and into-\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//Pure white.//\n\n\n\n\n\nHer eyes //burn// from the sudden contrast. Her thin coat is useless against the snow, and pulling her hat over her ears doesn\u2019t block out the roar of the wind. //Snow\u2026 why is there snow here?// Wherever this is, it\u2019s angry, and its fury pours out like an open wound. \n\n\n\nShe drops her flashlight, it wasn\u2019t doing her much good anyway. Her aching fingers twitch towards her reality anchor. //Not yet//, she commands herself, not until she gets closer.\n\n\n\nA gunshot pierces through the air. Alison stumbles against the winds and drops to her knees. Distantly, she can make out the figure of a man. She wants to scream for him, but her lips are sealed shut. \n\n\n\nThe figure moves away from her and suddenly the cold means nothing. She charges forward, gracelessly. Something, or more aptly, //someone// is lying on the stairs. Her father is just within her grasp. \n\n\n\nShe //freezes//. He\u2019s looking right at her. He can\u2019t see her, of course, but his eyes are trained on the exact spot she stands. She doesn\u2019t dare to move, even as the frost creeps up her skin and around her veins. He looks\u2026 scared. As he travels up the stairwell, out of view, the blizzard stops, all at once. \n\n\n\nAlison doesn\u2019t recognize the body on the staircase. He looks dead, but he also looks like there was never much life in him in the first place. As Alison stands there, lost in a sort of trance, his body shimmers and //melts//, disappearing into the cracks between the floorboards. She blinks, and she\u2019s standing in the middle of the living room. \n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a centerpoint to this hole in reality, and it\u2019s moving away from her, towards her father, or, perhaps //with// her father. She brushes the last, crumbling bits of frost off her coat and takes the first step. \n\n\n\nThe stairs go up, and then they go up, and then they continue to go up. Even when she\u2019s sure she\u2019s reached the next floor, they go up. When she\u2019s sure she\u2019s reached well over the height of the [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]], they go up. The walls groan, the steps creak, and the stairs go up. \n\n\n\nAlison could try and count the steps, which are going up, but she loses track of the numbers. Her mind is focused on what\u2019s waiting for her on the top of these ever upward steps. She\u2019s going to get her father out, guide him //down// the twisting stairwell. She\u2019s going to //win//. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cYou thought if you sent me away I wouldn\u2019t find out what you did? You were terrified of me, the perfect token of your guilt, of the promise you failed to keep.\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\nA moment's pause, followed by a weak sigh. //\u201cI did not kill your father.\u201d//\n\n\n\nShe\u2019s close, so close, but something\u2019s wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cYes you did. You may not have put a bullet through his head, but he\u2019s gone because of you. You couldn\u2019t stand to look at me, couldn\u2019t risk that I would pick up on the mold that\u2019s settled in your stomach.\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\nAlison starts running. Her body aches with the effort, her lungs burning with every breath. She takes off her hat, stuffs it in her pocket, and plucks out her reality anchor. It\u2019s warm in her hands. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cI know what you\u2019ve done. You can try and try and try to run and hide, but I know. And you know I know, you know I hate you for what you did. You know that one day, I\u2019ll walk into your office and do this-\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a man on the stairs, or, at least there\u2019s something in the shape of a man on the stairs. It- //he// presses a gun to her father\u2019s forehead. Alison activates her reality anchor. It feels like the ground has disappeared under her feet. She stumbles, pushing through the nausea, damn near slamming her full weight into her father. \n\n\n\n\u201cDad-!\u201d Oh god, //oh god//, it\u2019s really him. He feels real under her fingers. She doesn\u2019t have the time or the words to say what she needs to say to him. \u201c-we have to get out of here!\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cNo. No! Leave me alone!\u201d His voice sounds wrong, weak and desperate. She can see the white of his bloodshot eyes. \u201cJust go away!\u201d Alison bites her lip until it bleeds. \n\n\n\n\u201cThis place is too dangerous. I know there\u2019s someone you care about in there but you can\u2019t help him! Please, just come with me! My reality anchor is only so strong.\u201d The small, handheld anchor pulses in her hands, like a heartbeat. \n\n\n\nShe grabs him, sinking her fingers into his forearm. She\u2019s prepared for this, prepared to drag him kicking and screaming out of the gaping maw that snatched him from her in the first place. She didn\u2019t prepare for the stairs to be so slick, or for him to be so willing to shove her. \n\n\n\nIf she thought the feeling of activating the anchor was nauseating then there was no way she would ever be prepared for the //fall//. It wasn\u2019t like falling down the stairs, it was more like falling down a pit. You fall, and you fall, and there\u2019s nothing to grab onto, not a sign that there\u2019s ever going to be a bottom, that anything will ever catch you\n\n\n\nYou just keep going\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\nO\n\n\n\nW\n\n\n\nN. \n\n\n\nAnd then the ground crashes into her.\n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**4:17 am, Nobody\u2019s [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]], the extraction:**\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring this time of year, most people would chalk up Clef's increased irritability to any number of things. Clef was just an asshole, there was no point in psychoanalyzing his ever changing mood.\n\n\n\nDraven didn\u2019t have the same privilege of avoiding Clef whenever his mood spiked. If Draven wasn\u2019t personally doing field training with Clef, Clef was in his home, pretending like he wasn\u2019t madly in love with Draven\u2019s father. Clef was an important, if only a consistent, figure for the last quarter of Draven\u2019s life, and so Draven became intimately aware of the highs and lows of Clef\u2019s mental state, and what to do about it.\n\n\n\n\u00a0That's why Draven was first to kick down the door to Clef\u2019s [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]]. He //has// to be first. He //has// to be there for a Clef \n\n\n\nA corpse lies in a crumpled heap at the bottom of the stairs. No, not a corpse, not yet, she\u2019s still breathing. Not Draven's problem.\n\n\n\nClef\u2019s upstairs. Draven\u2019s been around him long enough to recognize this feeling. The hazy pressure of reality shifting slightly to the right. Ignoring the shouts from his fellow soldiers, Draven practically leaps over the body to get up the stairs. He //has// to be the one to get there first, there\u2019s no telling what the others might do if he doesn\u2019t. \n\n\n\n//Shoot first, ask questions later,// one of Clef\u2019s favorite things to drill into his student\u2019s little heads. Well Draven has a lot of questions right now, and he\u2019s not going to shoot his mentor. Not Clef, he can\u2019t lose Clef. \n\n\n\nHe bursts through the door, using more force than he needs to. The thick, copper stench of blood clogs up his nose. He\u2019s //long// past the point of being bothered by blood, but seeing it splattered across the walls and seeping out of Clef\u2019s closed eyes leaves him nauseous. //Draven should\u2019ve prevented this, should\u2019ve come in sooner, should\u2019ve tried a little harder before he went a blew his fucking brains out-//\n\n\n\nDraven snaps himself back into focus. Clef is alive. Heavily injured, but alive. //The Foundation will fix this, just get him out of here. The Foundation will fix this.// He repeats those words over and over in his mind as he worms his arms under Clef\u2019s and hoists him out of bed. //Fix Clef, fix Clef, fix Clef, fix dad, fix dad, fix-//\n\n\n\nClef\u2019s antlers block half of Draven\u2019s vision, and the sound Clef makes as he is dragged out of bed\u2026 will haunt Draven\u2019s nightmares for the rest of his life, or at least until the Foundation amnestizes him. \n\n\n\nAs he settles into autopilot, Draven has to ask where he went wrong. How did this happen without Draven noticing? It\u2019s not fair. //None of this is fair.//\n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**4:36 am, the long stretch between a [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]] and a home:**\n\n\n\n\n\nAlison wakes up to the feeling of a wet, sandpapery tongue dragging across her cheek. She opens her eyes for all of two seconds before they fall closed. Her anchor pulses near her head, and consciousness evades her. \n\n\n\nThe second time she wakes up she\u2019s moving. It\u2019s slow, but her body aches so much it feels agonizing. There\u2019s some talking, but it\u2019s all muffled. One blurry person stays next to her while the rest of the blurry figures run up the stairs. Someone says something that might be directed at her. They never get an answer. \n\n\n\nThe third time she wakes up it\u2019s to the yowl of a cat. She opens her eyes in time to see the person in uniform snatch up a cat off her chest. It digs its claws into her chest and screams as it is lifted away. \n\n\n\n\u201cNone of that now,\u201d the guard says, turning his back to Alison. She stands up, using the wall as a crutch. Her head throbs, every movement sending a white hot stab of pain through her head and down her spine. \n\n\n\nThe cat squirms out of the guard\u2019s arms, hits the ground face first and scampers out of the open door. The guard spins around, too focused on the cat to immediately notice that Alison is on her feet. They make extended eye contact, a beat passes, and Alison bolts out the door. \n\n\n\nFrom the perspective of the guard, he picked up a cat that seemed tempted to eat a heavily concussed woman, dropped it, and watched said heavily concussed woman bolt out the door and disappear from view. He would have run after her, but the rest of his teammates come down the stairs with a screaming, bloodied man, and she quickly becomes his last priority. \n\n\n\nAlison\u2019s perspective is similar, but as she gets her hat on, she loses feeling in her legs and collapses in a field across the street from her father\u2019s [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]]. She\u2019s had hundreds of injuries, fucked up a thousand times across a thousand universes, but this one hurts the most. \n\n\n\nThat cat is nearby, rolling around the grass. Alison forces herself back to her feet and stalks toward it. It perks up- likely just due to the noise, it shouldn\u2019t be able to see her.\n\n\n\n\u2026 //shouldn\u2019t// be able to. \n\n\n\nThe cat runs. Alison runs too. She doesn\u2019t know if she\u2019s running after the cat or away from Site-19. Neither direction is safe, but if she stops and thinks for too long she might not get up again. \n\n\n\nIt feels like he runs for hours, and she just might have, her body fueled by pure adrenaline. The cat leaps through brambles and brushes with about as much grace as she does. Site-19, her father\u2019s house, everything disappears from her view, replaced by a loved cabin. \n\n\n\nShe stops, making an active effort not to feel the weight of her body. The cat squirms into the cabin through a cracked window. She goes up the three steps and stands on the patio. The door creaks open without trouble. The house is empty, just a thin layer of dust covering its baren walls and floors.\n\n\n\n\u00a0This place feels loved. It\u2019s a warm feeling that seeps in and soothes her aching body. It also feels sad and abandoned. A place like this can\u2019t possibly understand why it\u2019s been left alone for so long. \n\n\n\nIn the center of this room there\u2019s a displaced floorboard. She approaches, drops to her knees, and pushes it aside. There\u2019s a hole under the [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]], big enough for a full grown man, occupied by a fat, old cat. The poor thing looks filthy, covered in dried blood, dust, mold, and cobwebs. It looks at her, spit dripping out of its mouth, two different colored eyes seeing her despite her hat. \n\n\n\nShe laughs. She\u2019s not sure what sparks it. Maybe it\u2019s because she just noticed the //hole// in her own mind. She\u2019s spent enough time in the anomalous community to recognize that something\u2019s been taken from her, snatched right out of her psyche. \n\n\n\n\u201cI was so close,\u201d she says to the empty air. \u201cSo close to\u2026 So close\u2026 So fucking close\u2026\u201d She sinks to the floor, breathing in the dust and mold, and laughs. \n\n\n\nShe drags herself into the hole and pulls the board over on top. \n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**4:58 am, a lake in Cornwall, England:**\n\n\n\n\n\nA fish swims in slow, aimless circles, unbothered by the rising waters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**8:12 am, Site-19, four hours after the incident:**\n\n\n\n\n\nClef isn\u2019t in his office by the time Adams comes in. That\u2019s normal, he\u2019s missed plenty of days and Adams is used to doing work on her own. It was the site director\u2019s job to get onto him for that, not hers.\n\n\n\nWhat //isn\u2019t// normal, is the group of armed guards and researchers poking around the cramped space. Did she miss an email?\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here? Where\u2019s Clef?\u201d \n\n\n\nA nerdy little man approaches her. \u201c//Ah//, Agent Adams. You\u2019ll find Clef in Humanoid Containment. I would suggest you hurry on.\u201d \n\n\n\n//Humanoid containment?// Must be some new, poor soul looking to worm their way onto Alpha-9. //Seems// like something Clef should have discussed with her beforehand, but, well, it is Clef.\n\n\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take a genius to put together that Clef isn\u2019t as human as he\u2019d like people to believe. Even knowing that couldn\u2019t have prepared Adams for the state of things in //High Security Humanoid Containment//. \n\n\n\nThe cell is way too small, for one. That\u2019s the first thing Adams becomes viscerally aware of. It\u2019s cramped, claustrophobic, just a miserable little mattress in the corner where a lump in the shape of Clef lays. He\u2019s still, eyes closed, face devoid of any of Clef\u2019s mannerisms.\n\n\n\nHe looks dead.\n\n\n\nEven when she gets close enough to see the slow rise and fall of his chest, she can\u2019t shake the feeling of looking at a corpse. It\u2019s almost the //opposite// of uncanny, this is no longer the false caricature of a man, this is real. The //realest// she\u2019s ever seen him. \n\n\n\n\u201cDr. Clef?\u201d She feels like a child calling out his name; he\u2019s clearly unconscious. It\u2019s more of a reassurance for herself. //Yes, this is doctor Clef I am looking at.//\n\n\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t get too close.\u201d Adams jumps out of her skin. She was so deep in her head she forgot she wasn\u2019t alone in here. A miserable looking boy sits in the corner opposite of Clef. He\u2019s got bags under his eyes and the general vibe of someone who\u2019s way too young to be in this position. \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d \n\n\n\nHe shrugs. \u201cComplicated.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cComplicated?\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, okay?\u201d He huffs like a dog and slumps back in the corner. \u201cYou\u2019re Agent Adams, right?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cHe talks about you sometimes. Only good things, I promise.\u201d His eyes twitch, a tight, professional smile on his face. He\u2019s not here as a guard, he\u2019s here as a friend. \n\n\n\n\u201cAnd who are you?\u201d He seems familiar, but Adams is terrible at putting names to faces. \n\n\n\n\u201cOh- Kondraki,\u201d he winces, \u201cDraven Kondraki. Agent- //ahem//.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cOh! I knew your father.\u201d //Knew// being a //very// strong word, but //met once// doesn\u2019t roll off the tongue as well. Another wince, his poker face is horrible today. \n\n\n\n\u201cA lot of people did\u2026\u201d he looks ready to fold in on himself when his eyes suddenly widen. Adams turns in time to see Clef\u2019s antlers scrap against the wall. \n\n\n\nHe howls. That\u2019s the only word to describe this noise. The walls shudder and creak as grass and flowers force their way between the floor tiles. Vines and flowers coil around the security cameras and Clef\u2019s antlers. Adams hunches over as a coughing fit overtakes her, flower petals spray out of her mouth. \n\n\n\nThere was one assignment Adams had before she was assigned as Clef\u2019s assistant and her fate was sealed. She visited a [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]], in the middle of Cornwall, England. It was incredibly brief, two days if even that, and something that just as quickly faded from memory. But, at this moment, as her lungs fill with vines and plant matter, she\u2019s standing in a dusty old bedroom, propped up on tiptoes, in hopes of catching a glimpse of the manifestation in the surrounding waters over the shoulders of the researcher in her way. \n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a tiny figure in the lake, made even smaller by the tall woman beside them. And as Adams\u2019s vision blurs and she falls to her knees, all she can think is: //it\u2019s him.//\n\n\n\nBut, of course now isn\u2019t the time for reminiscing. \n\n\n\nWhen the reality anchors come on Adams hits the ground before Clef does. Draven darts past her to grab Clef. Clef vomits, gray water spilling from his lips. Adams reaches into the back of her mouth to yank out a chain of lilies. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//What the fuck was that about?//\n\n\n\n\n\nClef sobs, heavy, disgusting heaves. His lips move but he can\u2019t form any words. \n\n\n\nAdams pulls herself together and scoots to Clef\u2019s other side. Clef\u2019s eyes between her and Draven. He squirms, his antler leaving a thin scratch across Draven\u2019s cheek. Adams backs off, instructing Draven to do the same.\n\n\n\nSomething\u2019s different about Clef, besides the obvious. It\u2019s hard to describe, but it reminds Adams of several months ago when Clef passed out in the middle of the hallway. This isn\u2019t Clef, not entirely. \n\n\n\nClef wheezes, clawing at his throat and chest, leaving red lines across his skin. They both grab a wrist before he can damage himself. \n\n\n\n\u201cBreathe!\u201d Adams commands, rather dumbly. \n\n\n\nClef looks at her for a long time before promptly passing out. They lay him on the sad slab the Foundation calls a bed. Neither says a word. \n\n\n\nAdams and Draven spend the next two days in that tiny, soundproof cell. \n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**8:46 am, Humanoid Containment, two days after the incident:**\n\n\n\n\n\nClef stares at the antlers on the ground, expression unreadable. Adams wants to tear into him, but she\u2019s tired. Everyone\u2019s tired. A metal tray sits in between the three of them. Three syringes, three doses of amnestics. \n\n\n\n\u201cAre you //fucking// serious?\u201d Adams isn\u2019t sure who she\u2019s asking. \u201cThis is- //bullshit!//\u201d \n\n\n\nClef //tsks//. He looks like shit, not that Adams has any right to say that. \u201cSite director\u2019s orders,\u201d some of the first noises that have come from him that aren\u2019t pained whimpers. \n\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just get this over with, okay?\u201d Draven picks up his syringe, as does Clef. \n\n\n\nThey both stare at her. \n\n\n\n\u201cI want to know why this is necessary. What about all the others observing us? Why does //he// have to take it too, huh?\u201d She gestures to Clef. \n\n\n\n\u201cAdams.\u201d The weakness in his voice makes Adams sick to her stomach. Where\u2019s the force? The bite? Instead, all she gets is shame. This isn\u2019t how she wants to remember him. \n\n\n\nShe takes her syringe. Clef waits to stick himself for both of them to finish. \n\n\n\nHe may get to forget the worst few nights of his life, but he doesn\u2019t get the same benefit of forgetting everything. Even as the amnestics course through his veins, he knows //nothing\u2019s going back to normal.//\n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**7:20 pm, Kain \u201cPathos\u201d Crow\u2019s office, four months after the incident:**\n\n\n\n\n\nKain is a very lucky man, if it's right to still describe him as such. He is lucky that, in spite of his situation, and the numerous //problems// he\u2019s created for the Foundation, that he\u2019s still useful enough to be kept alive. \n\n\n\nHis old bones don\u2019t move as well as they used to. For all the intelligence he has, he never could put himself back together properly. Something he\u2019s learned to live with, and will soon learn to die with. \n\n\n\nThere\u2019s another person in his office. His body may be frail, but his senses are just as strong as they\u2019ve always been. No, it wouldn\u2019t be right to say there\u2019s someone else in his office. There\u2019s a space where a person //should// be. \n\n\n\nThis absence comes and goes. Kain can always tell when it\u2019s left recently. The office will be a little cleaner, the many machines he\u2019s made to keep himself going will be freshly oiled, and he\u2019ll feel a pit in his stomach and a hole in his mind. A place where something //should// be, but of course isn\u2019t, and will never be again. \n\n\n\nOne day, when he\u2019s particularly aware of his surroundings, he catches the absence before it disappears. \n\n\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he says, \u201cYou\u2019ve always [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/new-tricks been very helpful to me], even though I\u2019m not the man, or dog, that I used to be. I wish I knew who you were. I think I\u2019m supposed to.\u201d \n\n\n\nThe lack of a person hovers before the doorway. \u201cMe\u2026? Oh, I'm really Nobody of note.\u201d \n\n\n\nKain knows words have been spoken to him, until he doesn\u2019t. \n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**10:09 pm, O5-1\u2019s office, one year after the incident:**\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cQuarterly report from Site-19, sir.\u201d\n\n\n\nFounder sighs. \u201cPut it on my desk.\u201d What was the point of all these blasted computers if they were going to keep printing out reports for every site? \n\n\n\nThe nameless factotum places the report on his desk. She pauses, brushing her fingers over the top page. She usually took care not to look too closely at anything meant for her Founder, but something caught her eye. \n\n\n\n\u201cFounder, sir?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cHm?\u201d He grunts, casting his sharp eyes on her. She shrinks. \n\n\n\n\u201cWho is the Director of Site-19?\u201d \n\n\n\nHe squints, eyebrows furrowed, and when he fails to produce a name he grunts and slams his fist against the table. \u201cIt\u2019s not my responsibility to keep track of every employee here!\u201d \n\n\n\nShe swallows a lump in her throat. \u201cI just wanted to ask because there\u2019s a name here- right here, but I can\u2019t quite\u2026 read it?\u201d The longer she stares at it the less sense it makes in her mind. \n\n\n\n\u201cDid I tell you to read my reports?\u201d \n\n\n\nShe steels herself, standing up straight. \u201cNo sir. No, I\u2019m sorry sir, you\u2019re right, I shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d She quickly backs out of Founder's office, mentally punching herself. She\u2019s worked here longer than most people have been alive, she should know better than this.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nFounder shakes his head as she leaves, lips tightly pursed. Slowly, almost like he didn\u2019t intend to, he drops his pen and grabs the report. He looks at the dotted line where the site director\u2019s name should be.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a hole in his mind, but why should he care if //Nobody// runs Site-19? As long as everything else is in order, it\u2019s not his problem. \n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**5:17 pm, [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]] in the woods, ten years before [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/yesterday the world ends]:**\n\n\n\n\n\nA man steps out of his home and sits on a creaky rocking chair. He\u2019s got a knife in one hand and a small loaf of bread in the other. He slices off the moldy crust and tears the bread apart with his fingers. \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s late, at least it feels late. The sun is sinking, painting the trees gold and red. He\u2019s tired. He barely sleeps these days, so every waking moment feels like he\u2019s ready to go back to bed. \n\n\n\nHis appearance has changed a lot in the past couple of years. His hair is especially long, nearly reaching his hips. He\u2019s long since given up on keeping it clean. His clothes are ratty, not exactly a washing machine down here, meaning he either has to steal clean clothes or make them. Though, he hasn\u2019t quite starved off his beer belly. \n\n\n\nA shotgun leans up against the wall next to him, probably the most well cared for thing he has anymore. Underneath the porch there\u2019s a jar full of dead butterflies, buried in the ground. He wishes they could\u2019ve had a better burial, but he has more important things to regret. \n\n\n\nHe feels a hole tear in his mind. He won\u2019t realize the hole is there, but he feels its presence. There\u2019s a reason he\u2019s sitting out here instead of in a box, a person who helped him out. He remembers a person there, remembers how they helped him, but for the life of him he can not put a face to these memories. \n\n\n\nHe remembers Clef, the last words he said to Clef, and his stomach aches. There\u2019s a mold settled inside of him, it\u2019s been there for years, dormant but alive. \n\n\n\nIt begins to stir.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"series-nav\"]]\n\n\u00ab **[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/lets-get-you-home Part 1]**\u00a0\u00a0| **[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/i-need-you-to-leave Part 2]**\u00a0\u00a0| **[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/this-is-not-a-place-of-honor Part 3]**\u00a0\u00a0| **Part 4** //(you are here)// | **[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/tomorrow-and-tomorrow-and-tomorrow Finale]** \u00bb\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["this-is-not-a-place-of-honor", "scp-4231", "the-king-is-dead", "lets-get-you-home", "self-similar", "portraits-of-your-father", "loosen-up-a-bit", "going-out-of-book", "new-tricks", "yesterday", "i-need-you-to-leave", "tomorrow-and-tomorrow-and-tomorrow", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "agent-adams", "black-queen", "bleak", "doctor-clef", "doctor-gears", "doctor-iceberg", "doctor-kondraki", "draven-kondraki", "nobody", "tale"], "title": "Nobody Runs Site-19 - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/nobody-runs-site-19", "year": 2024}, "nuclear-gunpoint": {"created_at": "2024-01-03T00:53:00", "creator": "Ethagon", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Ethagon", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/ethagon", "comment": "Creation", "date": "2024-01-03T00:53:00"}, {"author": "Ethagon", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/ethagon", "comment": "Added tags: art-exchange, period-piece, spy-fiction, tale.

The mystical tlanex would be once again the sole domain of the nation Tlaneyanco.</p>\n<p>At least that's what Yaotl thought until Adrix sat down at her desk with a stack of papers.</p>\n<p>\"And what's this?\"</p>\n<p>\"Irregularities. You know how I've been looking at the distribution of uranium for the last while?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah.\"</p>\n<p>\"First of all, there's a high concentration of experimental nuclear power plants in this region,\" Adrix pointed at one of the papers in the stack. A region in North America, US was marked. \"And they don't follow the trends.\"</p>\n<p>\"What trend?\"</p>\n<p>\"The end of the Arms Race had a noticeable impact on all nuclear research, not just the weapon sector.\"</p>\n<p>Yaotl looked at the data. The power plants in the region did shut down or reduce activity, but there was a delay of a few months to the start of the reduction compared with other regions.</p>\n<p>\"It's not concrete enough, this could be an imagined pattern.\"</p>\n<p>\"I thought so too, but look at their start points.\"</p>\n<p>Yaotl turned the page. At first, the region was empty. But as soon as the first experimental power plant was completed, they began springing up one after the other, far quicker than their counterparts in other regions.</p>\n<p>Yaotl mulled it over. \"It could still be a coincidence.\"</p>\n<p>\"We should at least check it out.\"</p>\n<p>\"If this is a trick to keep the Defense Division running\u2026\"</p>\n<p>\"I just want to be thorough.\"</p>\n<p>\"If our Division overexerts itself we become just as much a threat to Tlaneyanco as the nations we hide from.\" Yaotl stared at Adrix. \"But taking a look won't hurt.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>It ended up taking more than a look. Each power plant they visited had already been out of commission months prior. Every dead end left more and more of the allegedly delivered uranium unaccounted for. Both Yaotl and Adrix knew what somebody might need this much uranium for.</p>\n<p>Eventually, they found a plant that was still running. Still, the personnel seemed oblivious. All questions of relevance lead to blank stares. Where is the ordered uranium? Who managed your logistics? What sponsors do you have? All resulted in hazy non-answers.</p>\n<p>Yaotl suspected memory manipulation. So they brought in a master of the orange flame. Adrix was skillful in the control of Tlanexmonia, but this exceeded his capabilities. A few modified refreshments later the power plant workers spilled their newly regained memories.</p>\n<p>They had a lead.</p>\n<p>The lead brought them to a firearms factory. Given they were dealing with an unknown actor, barging in guns blazing wasn't an option. They needed more intel.</p>\n<p>After monitoring the arrivals and departures of the factory for a while, they found their target.</p>\n<p>The truck was well-guarded but stood no chance to the superior technology of Tlaneyanco. As always, they left no trace.</p>\n<p>The truck brought them four subjects to interrogate and one plant in a rusty box. Yaotl was testing multiple devices on the plant to no avail. The rest of the world would call it a Geiger Counter. They'd be wrong in so far as a 'Geiger Counter' could not distinguish between the four divine flames, merely labelling it all as 'radiation'. But whatever this plant was, it was unrelated to any of them.</p>\n<p>A door opened.</p>\n<p>\"One of them is willing to talk now.\"</p>\n<p>Adrix left Yaotl to the device and went into the interrogation room.</p>\n<p>Before her was a distraught man in a lab coat.</p>\n<p>\"So, who are you working for.\"</p>\n<p>The man looked up at him. \"Foundation.\"</p>\n<p>\"What foundation?\"</p>\n<p>\"I\u2026 I don't know. They never told me.\"</p>\n<p>\"What were you transporting?\"</p>\n<p>\"I was never told its properties, I was just sent to observe.\"</p>\n<p>\"Observe what?\"</p>\n<p>\"Unusual properties during the transport.\" Adrix gave him a hard look. \"Nothing happened. It stayed in the rusted cage.\" The man jolted up. \"Did you open it? The object <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">must</span> be kept in a rusted cage at all times.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh? What happens if we open it.\"</p>\n<p>The nervousness returned. \"That is above my clearance level. But it was implied it would be dangerous to let it escape.\"</p>\n<p>Adrix could not think of anything created by tlanex that could cause such an effect. It must really be unrelated to radiation then.</p>\n<p>\"What can you tell me about your uranium?\"</p>\n<p>\"U- uranium?\" The man gulped. \"I don't know.\"</p>\n<p>Better to be nice about this. \"Well, what do you think that it is for?\"</p>\n<p>\"Uranium is a normal material, I don't know why we would\u2013 oh.\"</p>\n<p>\"What?\"</p>\n<p>\"When I was instructed about containment breaches, the um, basically a prison break, it was implied there was a 'last resort' to make sure nothing escaped the Site.\"</p>\n<p>\"You're dealing with a lot of dangerous implications here.\"</p>\n<p>The man turned pale.</p>\n<p>\"Are you saying that your factory has a self-destruct button that uses <em>nuclear</em> detonation?\"</p>\n<p>\"I\u2013 I don't know for sure.\"</p>\n<p>They talked for a while after. It was not all that much information. The factory was a cover story for 'Site-21', a prison for abnormal entities and objects. Of other Sites, he had no knowledge.</p>\n<p>Adrix left the interrogation room.</p>\n<p>\"You got everything out of him?\" Yaotl had finished examining the plant.</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, he didn't know much. The transcript should be on your desk.\"</p>\n<p>\"Good.\" Having made a decision, Yaotl's eyes started burning with the amber flame.</p>\n<p>\"No. No! NO!\" Adrix rushed back to the interrogation room, but it was too late. The researcher's head had been burnt out from the inside. The result of Yaotl's unique application of Tlanexpoloa that she had been recruited for in the first place.</p>\n<p>\"Why?\"</p>\n<p>Yaotl crossed her arms. \"We can't take any risks. Not with an enemy this unknown.\"</p>\n<p>\"They aren't even using it for warfare!\"</p>\n<p>\"It doesn't matter. They have the capacity.\"</p>\n<p>\"If that were enough justification we would have stopped all nuclear research. Not just the weapon aspect.\"</p>\n<p>Yaotl scoffed. \"Are you saying we should just let these people go without interference?\"</p>\n<p>\"No, but,\" Adrix tried to get her thoughts in order. \"I think a slower approach would be beneficial here. If they're unburdened by national concerns they might even understand the sacredness of the tlanex.\"</p>\n<p>\"You're always making this distinction,\" Yaotl said. \"Tlanex when we use it and 'nuclear' when the rest of the world does. It's the same thing. We just got to it first. And I intend to keep that advantage.\"</p>\n<p>Adrix was aghast at a statement so close to blasphemy.</p>\n<p>\"Either way, we should just light their own bomb remotely and be done with it.\"</p>\n<p>Adrix composed herself. \"We need to know more to gauge what reaction that will cause. I say we operate as usual. Slow infiltration followed by surgical strikes to guide them away from nuclear energy.\"</p>\n<p>Yaotl knew she was right, even if she'd rather be done with it as soon as possible. \"Fine. We infiltrate. But as soon as things go south, we're switching to my plan.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Getting in was trivial. After getting suited up, Adrix simply laid down on one of the muddier roads that the trucks of Site-21 covered. She ensured the road was just muddy enough that the car had to slow down without stopping and then attached herself to the bottom of the car. A little orange flame manipulation would ensure she would stick to it throughout the ride.</p>\n<p>When they were in the Site proper she still hung to the car until the signal came.</p>\n<p><em>All clear.</em> That was the signal from Yaotl. They were communicating via the tlanex. As a user of the orange flame trained for this, Adrix could interpret the radiation signal directly while Yaotl had a radio able to convert the signal back to their base.</p>\n<p>Yaotl was just as vital to this mission as Adrix. Back at the temporary base were multiple binoculars modified to see all kinds of radiation generated by the Site. Yaotl was telling her that no human was near her now.</p>\n<p>That way they had also found out that the bomb was towards the centre at the bottom of the Site. The bomb was not their goal today.</p>\n<p>Adrix rolled out from under the car and went into the facility proper.</p>\n<p>As she peaked into a corridor the first thing she noticed was a state-of-the-art security camera. State-of-the-art for the rest of the world still included the occasional failure, however. Per the tlanex link, Adrix provided Yaotl with the coordinates of the camera cable relative to her.</p>\n<p>A small amber flame appeared right next to the camera. Adrix quickly sent corrections before the camera could notice. The flame vanished and the cable sparked.</p>\n<p>Adrix waited a moment longer. Yaotl sent her the location of where the camera cables terminated.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, they couldn't do this trick more than once. One malfunction would be the maximum they could get away with without raising too much suspicion.</p>\n<p>Adrix snuck past the rest of the surveillance. Her suit changed appearance to match the wall, so even if she was caught on camera she would likely not stand out.</p>\n<p>At one point she had to hook herself to the ceiling as security personnel walked in the direction she came from. Were they checking on the camera already? She briefly thought about sending Yaotl a message but decided against it. It wasn't unlikely she would pull the trigger even for such a minor thing. Better to carry on.</p>\n<p>She arrived at the surveillance room.</p>\n<p><em>Two people inside.</em></p>\n<p>Adrix used as little of the orange flame as possible to slowly transform the closed door into an open door without making a sound. She asked Yaotl for the status of the two.</p>\n<p><em>No reaction.</em></p>\n<p>So they weren't looking at the door.</p>\n<p>Both of them were sitting and not talking to each other. A trivial task to sneak up on each of them and let them smell her prepared handkerchief.</p>\n<p>They'd just think they dosed off whenever their senses would return to them.</p>\n<p>Time to investigate.</p>\n<p>The monitors were each handling multiple cameras, this was really bleeding-edge technology.</p>\n<p>She studied the footage of the Site for a while until she was sure where its archives were located. Adrix and Yaotl communicated for a while longer to reconstruct a floor plan of the Site based on the footage, then she left.</p>\n<p>The Archives were far from her current position, but having doctored the footage, the cameras weren't a problem.</p>\n<p>Finally, she was at the treasure cave.</p>\n<p>The door had to be changed again to gain access. Once inside, she started reading.</p>\n<p>Or rather, Yaotl would be. Adrix wasn't so much reading as she was dictating words via the tlanex link to the base.</p>\n<p>She remained undisturbed for five hours.</p>\n<p><em>Two. Incoming.</em></p>\n<p>Adrix quickly hid before two researchers entered the room.</p>\n<p>\"The file should be up there,\" said the first voice.</p>\n<p>\"Is it this one?\"</p>\n<p>The first voice was silent.</p>\n<p>\"Mark?\"</p>\n<p>\"You would not happen to know somebody that'd have interest in this folder, would you?\"</p>\n<p>\"No?\"</p>\n<p>\"Good. Because it's above the clearance level of anyone but three people here.\"</p>\n<p>\"Okay?\"</p>\n<p>\"And it was not in this position yesterday.\"</p>\n<p>That couldn't be. Adrix had put everything in exactly the way she found it. It could only be off by half a centimetre at best.</p>\n<p>The first voice spoke into their handheld radio. \"Mark here, I need you to look at the footage for the Archive for the last 24 hours. Over.\"</p>\n<p>The radio was silent. Adrix tensed.</p>\n<p>\"Please respond. Over.\"</p>\n<p>Silence.</p>\n<p>The first voice cursed. \"Stay in the Archive. If anything's suspicious, press the breach alarm.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, sir.\"</p>\n<p>Before the owner of the first voice to could leave the room, Adrix had stepped out of her hiding place and incapacitated him. The other researcher was so shocked that he didn't have time to register being knocked out.</p>\n<p>This was still salvageable. It was inevitable now for the Site to find out that they were breached, but not by whom. Her footage was already deleted. All that mattered now was leaving the Site undetected.</p>\n<p>Then the handheld radio spoke up. \"Mark? What is the problem?\"</p>\n<p>There was no way she could respond to this.</p>\n<p>\"Mark?\"</p>\n<p>The voice had hardened for the second call.</p>\n<p>\"Mark. Respond.\"</p>\n<p>Adrix left the Archive.</p>\n<p>From this position, her exit was only three corridors away, plus this section seemed to have next-to-no traffic, giving her\u2013</p>\n<p>The lights turned red. Walls rammed into existence on both sides of the corridor. An automated voice started giving orders.</p>\n<p>Adrix sunk against the wall. She had been so close.</p>\n<p><em>Site stirred up. Are you compromised?</em></p>\n<p>Adrix thought about a way out of this. Could she bulldoze through the walls until she was outside? Maybe. And then what? There is no way they wouldn't tail her. No way she would make it out without revealing the tlanex.</p>\n<p><em>Are you compromised?</em></p>\n<p>Adrix hardened her suit.</p>\n<p><em>Yes.</em></p>\n<p>It took only a moment for the bomb to go off. Not in the unclean way that was the only way the rest of the world could grasp the nuclear, but in the pure amber flame of Tonatiuhtcipactli.</p>\n<p>She just let the explosion wash over her. It wouldn't harm her as the rest of the Site caved into itself, bereft of any foundation to hold it together.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Adrix listlessly freed herself of the rubble. For the last metre a hand reached down and pulled her out. It was Yaotl.</p>\n<p>\"No time to laze around. We have to be gone before any reinforcements arrive.\"</p>\n<p>Adrix looked around. She wasn't the only point of interest. They were also digging out the few imprisoned creatures that survived the shock. Yaotl had also brought the plant.</p>\n<p>\"What are you doing.\"</p>\n<p>\"Our ultimate goal hasn't changed. Do the best we can to discourage the use of nuclear weaponry.\"</p>\n<p>The plant was set down amidst the rubble. The personnel started burying it while Yaotl engulfed it in her amber flame. The plant grew thorns and started thrashing its cage, not knowing what to do with all this new destructive energy.</p>\n<p>\"If they think the explosion just made their prisoners more dangerous, they're less likely to use it again.\"</p>\n<p>Adrix stared as the plant vanished under the remains of the Site.</p>\n<p>She sighed. \"At least it's over now.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm not so sure about that. This was just one Site. You were right in thinking we should infiltrate this organization so things develop as we need them to.\"</p>\n<p>Yaotl moved past Adrix. \"But that's for the Queen to decide. Maybe this will be <a href=\"http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-es-097\">the last time we hear from each other</a>.\"</p>\n<p>When the Foundation forces finally arrived, nothing even hinting at the existence of the Defense Division of Tlaneyanco remained.</p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/nuclear-gunpoint\">Nuclear Gunpoint</a>\" by Ethagon, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

As always, they left no trace.\n\n\n\nThe truck brought them four subjects to interrogate and one plant in a rusty box. Yaotl was testing multiple devices on the plant to no avail. The rest of the world would call it a Geiger Counter. They'd be wrong in so far as a 'Geiger Counter' could not distinguish between the four divine flames, merely labelling it all as 'radiation'. But whatever this plant was, it was unrelated to any of them.\n\n\n\nA door opened.\n\n\n\n\"One of them is willing to talk now.\"\n\n\n\nAdrix left Yaotl to the device and went into the interrogation room.\n\n\n\nBefore her was a distraught man in a lab coat.\n\n\n\n\"So, who are you working for.\"\n\n\n\nThe man looked up at him. \"Foundation.\"\n\n\n\n\"What foundation?\"\n\n\n\n\"I... I don't know. They never told me.\"\n\n\n\n\"What were you transporting?\"\n\n\n\n\"I was never told its properties, I was just sent to observe.\"\n\n\n\n\"Observe what?\"\n\n\n\n\"Unusual properties during the transport.\" Adrix gave him a hard look. \"Nothing happened. It stayed in the rusted cage.\" The man jolted up. \"Did you open it? The object __must__ be kept in a rusted cage at all times.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh? What happens if we open it.\"\n\n\n\nThe nervousness returned. \"That is above my clearance level. But it was implied it would be dangerous to let it escape.\"\n\n\n\nAdrix could not think of anything created by tlanex that could cause such an effect. It must really be unrelated to radiation then.\n\n\n\n\"What can you tell me about your uranium?\"\n\n\n\n\"U- uranium?\" The man gulped. \"I don't know.\"\n\n\n\nBetter to be nice about this. \"Well, what do you think that it is for?\"\n\n\n\n\"Uranium is a normal material, I don't know why we would\u2013 oh.\"\n\n\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\n\n\"When I was instructed about containment breaches, the um, basically a prison break, it was implied there was a 'last resort' to make sure nothing escaped the Site.\"\n\n\n\n\"You're dealing with a lot of dangerous implications here.\"\n\n\n\nThe man turned pale.\n\n\n\n\"Are you saying that your factory has a self-destruct button that uses //nuclear// detonation?\"\n\n\n\n\"I\u2013 I don't know for sure.\"\n\n\n\nThey talked for a while after. It was not all that much information. The factory was a cover story for 'Site-21', a prison for abnormal entities and objects. Of other Sites, he had no knowledge.\n\n\n\nAdrix left the interrogation room.\n\n\n\n\"You got everything out of him?\" Yaotl had finished examining the plant.\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, he didn't know much. The transcript should be on your desk.\"\n\n\n\n\"Good.\" Having made a decision, Yaotl's eyes started burning with the amber flame.\n\n\n\n\"No. No! NO!\" Adrix rushed back to the interrogation room, but it was too late. The researcher's head had been burnt out from the inside. The result of Yaotl's unique application of Tlanexpoloa that she had been recruited for in the first place.\n\n\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\n\nYaotl crossed her arms. \"We can't take any risks. Not with an enemy this unknown.\"\n\n\n\n\"They aren't even using it for warfare!\"\n\n\n\n\"It doesn't matter. They have the capacity.\"\n\n\n\n\"If that were enough justification we would have stopped all nuclear research. Not just the weapon aspect.\"\n\n\n\nYaotl scoffed. \"Are you saying we should just let these people go without interference?\"\n\n\n\n\"No, but,\" Adrix tried to get her thoughts in order. \"I think a slower approach would be beneficial here. If they're unburdened by national concerns they might even understand the sacredness of the tlanex.\"\n\n\n\n\"You're always making this distinction,\" Yaotl said. \"Tlanex when we use it and 'nuclear' when the rest of the world does. It's the same thing. We just got to it first. And I intend to keep that advantage.\"\n\n\n\nAdrix was aghast at a statement so close to blasphemy.\n\n\n\n\"Either way, we should just light their own bomb remotely and be done with it.\"\n\n\n\nAdrix composed herself. \"We need to know more to gauge what reaction that will cause. I say we operate as usual. Slow infiltration followed by surgical strikes to guide them away from nuclear energy.\"\n\n\n\nYaotl knew she was right, even if she'd rather be done with it as soon as possible. \"Fine. We infiltrate. But as soon as things go south, we're switching to my plan.\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nGetting in was trivial. After getting suited up, Adrix simply laid down on one of the muddier roads that the trucks of Site-21 covered. She ensured the road was just muddy enough that the car had to slow down without stopping and then attached herself to the bottom of the car. A little orange flame manipulation would ensure she would stick to it throughout the ride.\n\n\n\nWhen they were in the Site proper she still hung to the car until the signal came.\n\n\n\n//All clear.// That was the signal from Yaotl. They were communicating via the tlanex. As a user of the orange flame trained for this, Adrix could interpret the radiation signal directly while Yaotl had a radio able to convert the signal back to their base.\n\n\n\nYaotl was just as vital to this mission as Adrix. Back at the temporary base were multiple binoculars modified to see all kinds of radiation generated by the Site. Yaotl was telling her that no human was near her now.\n\n\n\nThat way they had also found out that the bomb was towards the centre at the bottom of the Site. The bomb was not their goal today.\n\n\n\nAdrix rolled out from under the car and went into the facility proper.\n\n\n\nAs she peaked into a corridor the first thing she noticed was a state-of-the-art security camera. State-of-the-art for the rest of the world still included the occasional failure, however. Per the tlanex link, Adrix provided Yaotl with the coordinates of the camera cable relative to her.\n\n\n\nA small amber flame appeared right next to the camera. Adrix quickly sent corrections before the camera could notice. The flame vanished and the cable sparked.\n\n\n\nAdrix waited a moment longer. Yaotl sent her the location of where the camera cables terminated.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, they couldn't do this trick more than once. One malfunction would be the maximum they could get away with without raising too much suspicion.\n\n\n\nAdrix snuck past the rest of the surveillance. Her suit changed appearance to match the wall, so even if she was caught on camera she would likely not stand out.\n\n\n\nAt one point she had to hook herself to the ceiling as security personnel walked in the direction she came from. Were they checking on the camera already? She briefly thought about sending Yaotl a message but decided against it. It wasn't unlikely she would pull the trigger even for such a minor thing. Better to carry on.\n\n\n\nShe arrived at the surveillance room.\n\n\n\n//Two people inside.//\n\n\n\nAdrix used as little of the orange flame as possible to slowly transform the closed door into an open door without making a sound. She asked\u00a0\u00a0Yaotl for the status of the two.\n\n\n\n//No reaction.//\n\n\n\nSo they weren't looking at the door.\n\n\n\nBoth of them were sitting and not talking to each other. A trivial task to sneak up on each of them and let them smell her prepared handkerchief.\n\n\n\nThey'd just think they dosed off whenever their senses would return to them.\n\n\n\nTime to investigate.\n\n\n\nThe monitors were each handling multiple cameras, this was really bleeding-edge technology.\n\n\n\nShe studied the footage of the Site for a while until she was sure where its archives were located. Adrix and Yaotl communicated for a while longer to reconstruct a floor plan of the Site based on the footage, then she left.\n\n\n\nThe Archives were far from her current position, but having doctored the footage, the cameras weren't a problem.\n\n\n\nFinally, she was at the treasure cave.\n\n\n\nThe door had to be changed again to gain access. Once inside, she started reading.\n\n\n\nOr rather, Yaotl would be. Adrix wasn't so much reading as she was dictating words via the tlanex link to the base.\n\n\n\nShe remained undisturbed for five hours.\n\n\n\n//Two. Incoming.//\n\n\n\nAdrix quickly hid before two researchers entered the room.\n\n\n\n\"The file should be up there,\" said the first voice.\n\n\n\n\"Is it this one?\"\n\n\n\nThe first voice was silent.\n\n\n\n\"Mark?\"\n\n\n\n\"You would not happen to know somebody that'd have interest in this folder, would you?\"\n\n\n\n\"No?\"\n\n\n\n\"Good. Because it's above the clearance level of anyone but three people here.\"\n\n\n\n\"Okay?\"\n\n\n\n\"And it was not in this position yesterday.\"\n\n\n\nThat couldn't be. Adrix had put everything in exactly the way she found it. It could only be off by half a centimetre at best.\n\n\n\nThe first voice spoke into their handheld radio. \"Mark here, I need you to look at the footage for the Archive for the last 24 hours. Over.\"\n\n\n\nThe radio was silent. Adrix tensed.\n\n\n\n\"Please respond. Over.\"\n\n\n\nSilence.\n\n\n\nThe first voice cursed. \"Stay in the Archive. If anything's suspicious, press the breach alarm.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n\nBefore the owner of the first voice to could leave the room, Adrix had stepped out of her hiding place and incapacitated him. The other researcher was so shocked that he didn't have time to register being knocked out.\n\n\n\nThis was still salvageable. It was inevitable now for the Site to find out that they were breached, but not by whom. Her footage was already deleted. All that mattered now was leaving the Site undetected.\n\n\n\nThen the handheld radio spoke up. \"Mark? What is the problem?\"\n\n\n\nThere was no way she could respond to this.\n\n\n\n\"Mark?\" \n\n\n\nThe voice had hardened for the second call.\n\n\n\n\"Mark. Respond.\"\n\n\n\nAdrix left the Archive.\n\n\n\nFrom this position, her exit was only three corridors away, plus this section seemed to have next-to-no traffic, giving her\u2013\n\n\n\nThe lights turned red. Walls rammed into existence on both sides of the corridor. An automated voice started giving orders.\n\n\n\nAdrix sunk against the wall. She had been so close.\n\n\n\n//Site stirred up. Are you compromised?//\n\n\n\nAdrix thought about a way out of this. Could she bulldoze through the walls until she was outside? Maybe. And then what? There is no way they wouldn't tail her. No way she would make it out without revealing the tlanex.\n\n\n\n//Are you compromised?//\n\n\n\nAdrix hardened her suit.\n\n\n\n//Yes.//\n\n\n\nIt took only a moment for the bomb to go off. Not in the unclean way that was the only way the rest of the world could grasp the nuclear, but in the pure amber flame of Tonatiuhtcipactli.\n\n\n\nShe just let the explosion wash over her. It wouldn't harm her as the rest of the Site caved into itself, bereft of any foundation to hold it together.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nAdrix listlessly freed herself of the rubble. For the last metre a hand reached down and pulled her out. It was Yaotl.\n\n\n\n\"No time to laze around. We have to be gone before any reinforcements arrive.\"\n\n\n\nAdrix looked around. She wasn't the only point of interest. They were also digging out the few imprisoned creatures that survived the shock. Yaotl had also brought the plant.\n\n\n\n\"What are you doing.\"\n\n\n\n\"Our ultimate goal hasn't changed. Do the best we can to discourage the use of nuclear weaponry.\"\n\n\n\nThe plant was set down amidst the rubble. The personnel started burying it while Yaotl engulfed it in her amber flame. The plant grew thorns and started thrashing its cage, not knowing what to do with all this new destructive energy.\n\n\n\n\"If they think the explosion just made their prisoners more dangerous, they're less likely to use it again.\"\n\n\n\nAdrix stared as the plant vanished under the remains of the Site.\n\n\n\nShe sighed. \"At least it's over now.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm not so sure about that. This was just one Site. You were right in thinking we should infiltrate this organization so things develop as we need them to.\"\n\n\n\nYaotl moved past Adrix. \"But that's for the Queen to decide.

But something in her personality - some deep sense of threat she carried through her work - have given her this <em>particular</em> job. Or maybe it was just the Forensic Chemistry degree she\u2019d fought tooth and nail for. Either way, she was one of the scattered members that made up the Unofficial Department of Disappearances.</p>\n<p>They were the ones you went to when you needed someone <em>gone</em>. Dead, disappeared, or worse, was something like a motto. Sage hadn\u2019t met most of her secondary coworkers in person. (They had a group chat, though.) Usually, cases came to them in an email from a Director or case supervisor - ask the right people, and you could get in touch with them fairly easily. It\u2019d be a name, a few details. Sometimes a justification for <em>why</em>. Sometimes not.</p>\n<p>The work got done either way. (Usually, if Sage was involved, it was done last minute at 2:30 in the morning. Not that it changed the results.)</p>\n<p>As for what happened to the people - it depended on the case. Usually forgotten. Mostly dead. Sometimes <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/deleted\" target=\"_blank\">deleted</a>.</p>\n<p>Sage was working on a man named Jared Lindstrom. In three days, he would die of an untraceable poison that recreated the effects of an aortic aneurysm, and be found in his apartment by Sergei Sokolov of the New York Police Department (a man whose birth certificate identified him as Jack Marlene, affectionately called \u201cJackrabbit\u201d by his Foundation friends when he wasn\u2019t under cover).</p>\n<p>With Jared dead, the memetic virus that had been ravaging America would officially have its final spark squashed, and Dr. Hansel Loveland, the supervisor who\u2019d spent the past year tracking it would breathe easy again.</p>\n<p>This all hinged on Sage\u2019s ability to actually make that poison. (Obviously, she could. She knew her own brilliance. It was just a matter of testing it.)</p>\n<p>There were eight dead rats in the lab. She\u2019d stashed the ninth one in the break room fridge, which she probably should take out soon before she forgets it and has to bear the brunt of Researcher Macnamara\u2019s disgusted annoyance.</p>\n<p>Rat 8\u2019s blood currently rested in the tubes in front of her, one being put through heavy-duty liquid chromatography to see if the Noroxin look-alike she\u2019d been working with still showed up.</p>\n<p>The blood separated easily, a faint clear rim of liquid at the top showing the separation. Her failure on display.</p>\n<p>Cursing, Sage made a note, swinging back over to the table. Another sample - balance the acidity slightly with a dash of\u2026 right. A quick pass over the bunsen burner after a bit of heat reactive diluent. <em>Perfect</em>. Shaking the vial and noting the changes into a battered notebook, Sage worked quickly.</p>\n<p>She picked up another rat. It squeaked, flailing, as it was strapped to the table, a gloved hand holding it secure as Sage quickly noted the needle entrypoint, and pushed the readied syringe into the vein. \u201cSorry, pal. It\u2019s for science.\u201d</p>\n<p>And so the cycle continued.</p>\n<p>In an ideal world, she\u2019d be using human subjects to test with, and the body on the table beside her would be a proper cadaver, not a sorry-looking white rat. But Director Reynolds had made that mistake once, during the first Disappearances case Sage had worked on, and it had ended in a two hour lecture on why Sage was requesting new D-Class be transferred in, because she\u2019d \u201crun out\u201d of the ones they already had.</p>\n<p>Well, it was her fault for not properly briefing Sage on exactly what her plan <em>was</em> with the test subjects. If she had, she\u2019d have realised that trial-and-error testing doesn\u2019t mix the best with perfecting the effects of lethal toxins.</p>\n<p>It was Sage\u2019s second case that was going to be handled almost completely by her own hands. In the past, she\u2019d helped in more subtle ways - modifying amnestics, and exposing coworkers to anti-memes that Wheeler had sent her. Testing the waters.</p>\n<p>Finally - <em>finally</em> - the chromatography test came back clean three times in a row. Meaning that R-D-012 (she\u2019d begun keeping a logbook of her furry test subjects, numbered like regular D-Class to boot) had died of an aortic aneurysm at 11:52:06 PM, just like expected.</p>\n<p>However, this wasn\u2019t something to celebrate over. Because this meant it was time for the next bit: Grovelling.</p>\n<p>The elevator rattled on the way up, buzzing with the harsh fluorescents. It was a stark contrast to the dark hallways between tinted LED-lit labs and the dim break room next door. However, it wasn\u2019t the worst thing she\u2019d endure that night, Sage thought. She was going to have to face Director Reynolds herself.</p>\n<p>She didn\u2019t bother to knock at the door, instead walking in. Reynolds usually wasn\u2019t doing anything that private anyways, unless glaring at her desk and muttering counted.</p>\n<p>The straight-laced, ice-eyed blonde\u2019s head snapped up like a lightning rod as Sage strolled in, the small ginger fitting herself into the seat and kicking her legs up so one of them dangled over the side of the chair. It gave her the impression of a sprawled cat, content in its perch, while Reynolds hissed at the invasion.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey boss,\u201d Sage quipped, taking the first blow. A lazy smile dragged onto her lips, Cheshire cat eyes slightly manic in their sleep-deprived glory.</p>\n<p>\u201cDr. West,\u201d Reynolds replied coolly, disdain in her voice. \u201cIn the future, I would prefer you to knock before barging into my office. Especially at the ripe hour of 10 at night.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sage quirked an eyebrow. \u201cNot to nag, but you\u2019re two hours off on that one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Brow furrowing, Reynolds grabbed for her phone on her desk, flipping it over to read the time. She swore. \u201cGreat. Well, I apologise. Good morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sage snickered, letting the tension drag out before she launched her barrage. \u201cI need a test subject.\u201d</p>\n<p>Reynolds replied smoothly, a thin blonde eyebrow raised in turn. \u201cI can contact one of our associates to supply you with more test animals.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her eyes told Sage that this was her moment to back down from the issue.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot what I meant,\u201d Sage replied, a hefty sigh par to her tone. \u201cI need something of the <em>homo sapien</em> variety.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d Reynolds already knew, of course, but she always asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cDepartment of Disappearances,\u201d Sage said back.</p>\n<p>Usually, this phrase would get her out of most of these conversations.</p>\n<p><em>Why do you need to pick up mnestic refills?</em></p>\n<p><em>Department of Disappearances.</em></p>\n<p><em>Where did that blood even come from?</em></p>\n<p><em>Department of Disappearances.</em></p>\n<p><em>Here, I think this is your order\u2026 what are these pills for again?</em></p>\n<p><em>Department of Disappearances.</em></p>\n<p><em>What in God\u2019s name are you doing with that cactus?</em></p>\n<p><em>Department of Disappearances.</em></p>\n<p>Worked like a charm in shutting down discussion. Even if technically, she wasn\u2019t allowed to use the excuse about half the time she did, due to a bullshit social construct known as \u201cClearance\u201d.</p>\n<p>But Reynolds was unfortunately an insane maniac who asked too many questions for her own good. And so she simply smirked. \u201cPerhaps you could brief me on the case.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m testing poisons. I need a subject,\u201d Sage said, through gritted teeth.</p>\n<p>\u201cI once again, refer you to the extensive supply of testing anim-\u201d Reynolds started, in all her prim <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">smug bitch</span> Site Director glory.</p>\n<p>\u201cLives are on the line, here!\u201d Sage snapped. She had no idea if this was true - but there was in all likelihood a chance that the memetic did kill it\u2019s victims. Probably not, though, supposing as Jared was still obnoxiously alive. Which was what Sage was trying to fix. So maybe lives were on the line after all, just on the wrong side of it. \u201cI\u2019ve <em>used</em> rats. I\u2019ve used so many <em>fucking rats</em>. I need a real human to test this on, now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd if the human doesn\u2019t work?\u201d Reynolds asked, definitely mocking her. \u201cWhat\u2019s your plan then?\u201d</p>\n<p>And here was the problem. If it didn\u2019t work, Sage would need another subject. And their argument would start anew.</p>\n<p>There wasn\u2019t really a good answer to it. (Actually there definitely was, and it was just letting Sage use the damn D-Class for their purpose because this was getting stupid) The issue didn\u2019t feel important enough to drag another committee into it, but it also didn\u2019t feel insignificant enough that either wanted to simply settle on it.</p>\n<p>This is why Sage thought that Dr. Lost was the ideal human (they were human? Right? Did \u201creality anchor\u201d negate that? Were they mutually exclusive?). Not a single bone in their back. Compliant, people-pleasing, passive. Not headstrong, or stubborn, or any of the other annoying traits that Director Emerald Reynolds used to push her evil agenda of executive fairness and corporate functionality.</p>\n<p>The silence stretched out, before Sage gritted her teeth, crossing her arms. \u201c<em>I don\u2019t know.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Reynolds huffed, a disappointed mother bear clucking at her impetuous cub. \u201cWell, when you do, come back and give me an answer. I have work to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>This wasn\u2019t fair. \u201cI have <em>three days</em> to get this done!\u201d Sage hissed, done with the sheer amount of <em>stone-walling</em> Reynolds was throwing at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cWest,\u201d Reynolds said, all calm now, as if she wasn\u2019t being the world's greatest asshole. \u201cI gave you Level 4 Clearance as part of your role. You have access to mountains of information, if you can just be patient enough to properly go through it. And you can. Because you\u2019re an incredibly smart Chemist when you choose to stop behaving like a child.\u201d She sighed, leaning back. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019m going to help you as it stands.\u201d</p>\n<p>The words stung. Unfortunately, it only stoked the fire Sage had been carrying throughout the night, instead of driving the point home. \u201c<em>Fine.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Standing up, she walked out, slamming the door on the Director.</p>\n<p>It was clear Reynolds hated her. Sage knew that. The feeling was fucking <em>mutual</em>, as far as she was concerned.</p>\n<p>She\u2019d just have to take it into her own hands.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>After she got the rat out of the break room fridge.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Emerald shook her head, looking down at her work. Sage would figure it out. She trusted her.</p>\n<p>She\u2019d sent an email into the Disappearances department already, with the current data Sage had - they had other Chemists. They\u2019d figure it out, no matter how disgruntled they acted that their little ginger genius was out of commission for the time being.</p>\n<p>Emerald didn\u2019t try to make a habit of testing people, but there was something about Sage she couldn\u2019t help but feel\u2026 fond of.</p>\n<p>Her brother Jamie was similar. She pushed that thought out just as soon as it crept into her head - she wasn\u2019t going to think about him. Not now. Forcing her eyes back down to her desk, and tucking a loose strand of blonde hair back into it\u2019s ponytail prison, she tapped a finger over the sticky note laid out there. Written with three words - a reminder of something she had to do. A request she had to make in advance.</p>\n<p><em>Deus Ex Machina</em>.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"earthworm\">\n<div class=\"first true/false\">\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-deal-of-agent-heckerman/comments/show\">The Deal Of Agent Heckerman</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"hub yes/no\">\n<p><a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dr-vikki-lost\">ALL TALES</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"last true/false\">\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sage-west-s-guide-to-making-dead-men-talk/comments/show\">Sage West's Guide To Making Dead Men Talk</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Did you like this?

She\u2019d stashed the ninth one in the break room fridge, which she probably should take out soon before she forgets it and has to bear the brunt of Researcher Macnamara\u2019s disgusted annoyance.\n\n\n\nRat 8\u2019s blood currently rested in the tubes in front of her, one being put through heavy-duty liquid chromatography to see if the Noroxin look-alike she\u2019d been working with still showed up. \n\n\n\nThe blood separated easily, a faint clear rim of liquid at the top showing the separation. Her failure on display.\n\n\u00a0\n\nCursing, Sage made a note, swinging back over to the table. Another sample - balance the acidity slightly with a dash of\u2026 right. A quick pass over the bunsen burner after a bit of heat reactive diluent. //Perfect//. Shaking the vial and noting the changes into a battered notebook, Sage worked quickly. \n\n\n\nShe picked up another rat. It squeaked, flailing, as it was strapped to the table, a gloved hand holding it secure as Sage quickly noted the needle entrypoint, and pushed the readied syringe into the vein. \u201cSorry, pal. It\u2019s for science.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd so the cycle continued.\n\n\n\nIn an ideal world, she\u2019d be using human subjects to test with, and the body on the table beside her would be a proper cadaver, not a sorry-looking white rat. But Director Reynolds had made that mistake once, during the first Disappearances case Sage had worked on, and it had ended in a two hour lecture on why Sage was requesting new D-Class be transferred in, because she\u2019d \u201crun out\u201d of the ones they already had. \n\n\n\nWell, it was her fault for not properly briefing Sage on exactly what her plan //was// with the test subjects. If she had, she\u2019d have realised that trial-and-error testing doesn\u2019t mix the best with perfecting the effects of lethal toxins. \n\n\n\nIt was Sage\u2019s second case that was going to be handled almost completely by her own hands. In the past, she\u2019d helped in more subtle ways - modifying amnestics, and exposing coworkers to anti-memes that Wheeler had sent her. Testing the waters.\n\n\n\nFinally - //finally// - the chromatography test came back clean three times in a row. Meaning that R-D-012 (she\u2019d begun keeping a logbook of her furry test subjects, numbered like regular D-Class to boot) had died of an aortic aneurysm at 11:52:06 PM, just like expected.\n\n\n\nHowever, this wasn\u2019t something to celebrate over. Because this meant it was time for the next bit: Grovelling.\n\n\n\nThe elevator rattled on the way up, buzzing with the harsh fluorescents. It was a stark contrast to the\u00a0\u00a0dark hallways between tinted LED-lit labs and the dim break room next door. However, it wasn\u2019t the worst thing she\u2019d endure that night, Sage thought. She was going to have to face Director Reynolds herself. \n\n\n\nShe didn\u2019t bother to knock at the door, instead walking in. Reynolds usually wasn\u2019t doing anything that private anyways, unless glaring at her desk and muttering counted. \n\n\n\nThe straight-laced, ice-eyed blonde\u2019s head snapped up like a lightning rod as Sage strolled in, the small ginger fitting herself into the seat and kicking her legs up so one of them dangled over the side of the chair. It gave her the impression of a sprawled cat, content in its perch, while Reynolds hissed at the invasion. \n\n\n\n\u201cHey boss,\u201d Sage quipped, taking the first blow. A lazy smile dragged onto her lips, Cheshire cat eyes slightly manic in their sleep-deprived glory.\n\n\n\n\u201cDr. West,\u201d Reynolds replied coolly, disdain in her voice. \u201cIn the future, I would prefer you to knock before barging into my office. Especially at the ripe hour of 10 at night.\u201d\n\n\n\nSage quirked an eyebrow. \u201cNot to nag, but you\u2019re two hours off on that one.\u201d\n\n\n\nBrow furrowing, Reynolds grabbed for her phone on her desk, flipping it over to read the time. She swore. \u201cGreat. Well, I apologise. Good morning.\u201d\n\n\n\nSage snickered, letting the tension drag out before she launched her barrage. \u201cI need a test subject.\u201d\n\n\n\nReynolds replied smoothly, a thin blonde eyebrow raised in turn. \u201cI can contact one of our associates to supply you with more test animals.\u201d\n\n\n\nHer eyes told Sage that this was her moment to back down from the issue.\n\n\n\n\u201cNot what I meant,\u201d Sage replied, a hefty sigh par to her tone. \u201cI need something of the //homo sapien// variety.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d Reynolds already knew, of course, but she always asked. \n\n\n\n\u201cDepartment of Disappearances,\u201d Sage said back.\n\n\n\nUsually, this phrase would get her out of most of these conversations. \n\n\n\n//Why do you need to pick up mnestic refills?//\n\n\n\n//Department of Disappearances.//\n\n\n\n//Where did that blood even come from?//\n\n\n\n//Department of Disappearances.//\n\n\n\n//Here, I think this is your order\u2026 what are these pills for again?//\n\n\n\n//Department of Disappearances.//\n\n\n\n//What in God\u2019s name are you doing with that cactus?//\n\n\n\n//Department of Disappearances.//\n\n\n\nWorked like a charm in shutting down discussion. Even if technically, she wasn\u2019t allowed to use the excuse about half the time she did, due to a bullshit social construct known as \u201cClearance\u201d. \n\n\n\nBut Reynolds was unfortunately an insane maniac who asked too many questions for her own good. And so she simply smirked. \u201cPerhaps you could brief me on the case.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m testing poisons. I need a subject,\u201d Sage said, through gritted teeth. \n\n\n\n\u201cI once again, refer you to the extensive supply of testing anim-\u201d Reynolds started, in all her prim --smug bitch-- Site Director glory. \n\n\n\n\u201cLives are on the line, here!\u201d Sage snapped. She had no idea if this was true - but there was in all likelihood a chance that the memetic did kill it\u2019s victims. Probably not, though, supposing as Jared was still obnoxiously alive. Which was what Sage was trying to fix. So maybe lives were on the line after all, just on the wrong side of it. \u201cI\u2019ve //used// rats. I\u2019ve used so many //fucking rats//. I need a real human to test this on, now.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd if the human doesn\u2019t work?\u201d Reynolds asked, definitely mocking her. \u201cWhat\u2019s your plan then?\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd here was the problem. If it didn\u2019t work, Sage would need another subject. And their argument would start anew.\n\n\n\nThere wasn\u2019t really a good answer to it. (Actually there definitely was, and it was just letting Sage use the damn D-Class for their purpose because this was getting stupid) The issue didn\u2019t feel important enough to drag another committee into it, but it also didn\u2019t feel insignificant enough that either wanted to simply settle on it.\n\n\n\nThis is why Sage thought that Dr. Lost was the ideal human (they were human? Right? Did \u201creality anchor\u201d negate that? Were they mutually exclusive?). Not a single bone in their back. Compliant, people-pleasing, passive. Not headstrong, or stubborn, or any of the other annoying traits that Director Emerald Reynolds used to push her evil agenda of executive fairness and corporate functionality. \n\n\n\nThe silence stretched out, before Sage gritted her teeth, crossing her arms. \u201c//I don\u2019t know.//\u201d\n\n\n\nReynolds huffed, a disappointed mother bear clucking at her impetuous cub. \u201cWell, when you do, come back and give me an answer. I have work to do.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis wasn\u2019t fair. \u201cI have //three days// to get this done!\u201d Sage hissed, done with the sheer amount of //stone-walling// Reynolds was throwing at her. \n\n\n\n\u201cWest,\u201d Reynolds said, all calm now, as if she wasn\u2019t being the world's greatest asshole. \u201cI gave\u00a0\u00a0you Level 4 Clearance as part of your role. You have access to mountains of information, if you can just be patient enough to properly go through it. And you can. Because you\u2019re an incredibly smart Chemist when you choose to stop behaving like a child.\u201d She sighed, leaning back. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019m going to help you as it stands.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe words stung. Unfortunately, it only stoked the fire Sage had been carrying throughout the night, instead of driving the point home. \u201c//Fine.//\u201d \n\n\n\nStanding up, she walked out, slamming the door on the Director. \n\n\n\nIt was clear Reynolds hated her. Sage knew that. The feeling was fucking //mutual//, as far as she was concerned. \n\n\n\nShe\u2019d just have to take it into her own hands.\n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\nAfter she got the rat out of the break room fridge.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nEmerald shook her head, looking down at her work. Sage would figure it out. She trusted her. \n\n\n\nShe\u2019d sent an email into the Disappearances department already, with the current data Sage had - they had other Chemists. They\u2019d figure it out, no matter how disgruntled they acted that their little ginger genius was out of commission for the time being. \n\n\n\nEmerald didn\u2019t try to make a habit of testing people, but there was something about Sage she couldn\u2019t help but feel\u2026 fond of. \n\n\n\nHer brother Jamie was similar. She pushed that thought out just as soon as it crept into her head - she wasn\u2019t going to think about him. Not now. Forcing her eyes back down to her desk, and tucking a loose strand of blonde hair back into it\u2019s ponytail prison, she tapped a finger over the sticky note laid out there. Written with three words - a reminder of something she had to do. A request she had to make in advance. \n\n\n\n//Deus Ex Machina//.\n\n\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:earthworm\">:scp-wiki:component:earthworm</a>\n\n| first=true/false | last=true/false | hub=yes/no\n\n| previous-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-deal-of-agent-heckerman/comments/show | previous-title=The Deal Of Agent Heckerman\n\n| next-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sage-west-s-guide-to-making-dead-men-talk/comments/show | next-title=Sage West's Guide To Making Dead Men Talk\n\n| hub-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dr-vikki-lost | hub-title=ALL TALES\n\n]]\n\n\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n> Did you like this?

It was Agent Jack \u201cJackrabbit\u201d Marlene, known to the Franklin County Police Department as Detective Darren Hazel (when he wasn\u2019t working for the NYCPD as Detective Sergei Solokov). The man with many names was usually a tolerable guy - a great buddy for a night of duck pin bowling and cocktails, at least.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis about Loveland?\u201d she asked, leaning back into her chair. Ezekiah Lenora shot her an odd look from across the room, and West just winked in turn.</p>\n<p>\u201cNah. Not <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sage-west-s-guide-to-keeping-up-disappearances\" target=\"_blank\">a Disappearances case.</a> Not yet, at least. We just got a new stiff in, and it\u2019s looking like it might be anomalous.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow long?\u201d Sage stood, readying herself to grab her car keys and bolt.</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout a half an hour. I\u2019ve stuck some wrenches into procedure so the evidence doesn\u2019t get shipped to the labs too soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d Sage smirked, satisfied. \u201cNice going, chief. I\u2019ll be on route in five, over in thirty if I\u2019m quick.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jackrabbit laughed, as Sage quickly tapped Levi on the shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m heading out for a meeting. Tell Novak I\u2019m off shift, and give her my regards,\u201d she gave a smug smile, and Levi sighed. \u201cShe\u2019ll bite your head off about this later, y\u2019know. I\u2019m not sure how you haven\u2019t been actually killed by Reynolds.\u201d</p>\n<p>Director Emerald Reynolds and Assistant Director/Chemistry Department Head Celeste Novak were a formidable alliance at the worst of times, and a united front ruling over a godless realm of terror at their best. Thankfully, Reynolds was one of the few people who knew Sage\u2019s involvement in Disappearances. And that was damn helpful.</p>\n<p>Of course, that didn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t still make Sage\u2019s life hell for it.</p>\n<p>West pulled up the puffy white coat over her shoulders, tugging up the fur-lined hood and holding the phone in place with her chin. \u201cGive me the run-down on the case.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d he started.</p>\n<p>Her Jeep beeped a greeting, doors unlocking as she slid inside and turned the call to speaker, engine revving as she pulled out. Cruising out from the Site 404 parking lot, she hit the road at about 20 miles above the speed limit. A free hand fumbled for a hairband shoved into the seat cushions, quickly twisting up the French braid she had sported into a neat ginger loop at the base of her neck.</p>\n<p>West had already made the mistake of forgetting to tie her hair up at a crime scene before, and had paid in the mess scrubbing dried blood out of her hair left on her tiles. Oh, and the gross factor and all that. Though it\u2019d been a while since Sage had actually cringed at the sight of blood.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe did an initial sweep of the primary scene and Joseph spotted the guy pretty quickly. Cops wouldn\u2019t let us in for a bit, but once it was clear the guy was done for, I was able to get a good look. The actual process seemed to go smoothly, but as soon as the guys with me saw his face, they started talking about him like they knew him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPersonally?\u201d Sage asked, noting it down into the margins of her mind.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, more tangentially. Carlie said she\u2019d seen him on a game show from the 90s, and Joseph thinks he was featured as a guest speaker at an old forensics lecture he\u2019d seen on tape. No physical contact connections, and no one mentioned anything more recent than 2006. I asked.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sage hummed, adding another five miles to her speed limit hating pace. \u201cDid you get a look at him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNope,\u201d Jackrabbit clicked his tongue. \u201cI showed up late to the scene and thankfully heard Carlie and Joseph\u2019s stories before I got too close. Skipped out on the ambulance ride and took my car back to the station so I could call you in private.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Sage ran her tongue over her teeth and began puzzling out the possibilities in her head. Memetic effect, possible cognitohazard. \u201cDid you have any trouble walking away from it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, I was curious, but it wasn\u2019t\u2026 shit, now that you mention it. Joseph said all three of the guys who found the body walked over there right after they arrived. Definitely could be some kind of anomalous compulsion playing into it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, mind-effecting,\u201d Sage concluded. \u201cIf this is memetic, it\u2019s isolated enough to be on the weaker side. Otherwise, you\u2019d be under the effect just from talking to the hive mind minions.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jackrabbit snorted from on the other end of the line. \u201cAre you ever nice?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t make a habit of it,\u201d Sage replied simply, checking her lipstick in the rearview mirror. She hated walking into a crime scene looking anything but her best. Thankfully, the look was still intact, and her small ginger figure cut as imposing a figure as ever. \u201cI\u2019m still waiting for an email about the My Little Foundation: Containment Is Magic pitch.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jackrabbit actually laughed at this. \u201cNow that\u2019s just genuinely awful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood. We\u2019re on the same page.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere are you now?\u201d Jackrabbit asked, ignoring her cynicism.</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout fifteen minutes away.\u201d At this point, Sage\u2019s foot was pedal to the metal, roaring the car like a bullet down the highway. It was pure Ohio in that the only use the road got was from people crossing through to get to another state worth their time, and extra helpful in the fact that it didn\u2019t lead many worthwhile places. That made it the perfect spot to hide away a few large blocky white buildings, easily mistaken as storage units to those with a less discerning eye.</p>\n<p>The closer to Columbus she sped, though, the more drivers popped up, and the more likely it was for Sage to face actual repercussions for the strange, maniacal replication of good driving she specialised in. The one time Sage had carpooled 404 Director Emerald Reynolds, it\u2019d ended with Sage kicked to shotgun, after about ten minutes of Reynolds white-knuckling the door handle and snapping at every slight movement in the window.</p>\n<p>Some people just weren\u2019t built for her lifestyle, West considered.</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus Christ\u2026\u201d Jackrabbit groaned, counting himself happily amongst the \u201csome people\u201d. \u201cWell, I\u2019m en route to enter the station in under five. See you out front.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGot it, boss,\u201d Sage purred, just as the phone hung up.</p>\n<p>It was showtime.</p>\n<p>\u2014-</p>\n<p>It was hard to be intimidating when you barely reached five feet tall on a good day. But Sage West managed it. The trick was knowing her own worth - and then some. Nothing makes a grown man more embarrassed than being told his job has been usurped by a 27-year-old ginger with a fur collar bigger than her head. And West delighted in that.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for Detective Hazel,\u201d she snapped as she strode in through the doors, ready to boss around whatever officer ended up having the misfortune of being the first to find her.</p>\n<p>She was slightly disappointed when Jackrabbit himself was the voice to respond. \u201cRight here, Doc.\u201d He leaned against the wall, arms crossed. Long puffy dijon coat, over black slacks and a simple button-up. Dark hair messy and olive skin flushed with the cold.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh. Darren,\u201d she pursed her lips. \u201cWhat\u2019s the latest?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI got the body set up downstairs for you. Do you need anything?\u201d As good of an Agent as he was, he still wasn\u2019t as skilled in the specifics of handling anomalies as she was. He was mainly there to pick them out and handle things while he waited for people like her to arrive.</p>\n<p>\u201cNope. Hold on a second,\u201d she whipped out her phone, shooting a message to one of her Department of Disappearances colleagues.</p>\n<p><em>Handling a cognitohazardous meme that infects victims who view it. Need to counter it.</em></p>\n<p>A long pause- and then a reply. Three dots waiting, before-</p>\n<p><em>Get a sharpie and write a power phrase on your arms and throat. That might be able to create a protective counter meme. If you start to go under, just touch the words and say them out loud.</em></p>\n<p>Sage shot back - <em>got it</em> and whistled to Jackrabbit. \u201cI need a sharpie.\u201d</p>\n<p>He fumbled, grabbing one off the desk, and handing it over. Wordlessly, she pulled back her sleeves and collar, writing the words \u201cYOU DO NOT RECOGNISE THIS MAN\u201d in large black letters. Capping it, she handed it back. \u201cShould I do the same?\u201d Jack questioned, eyeing her.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be as effective for you. I\u2019ve got training in memetic blocking to back me up,\u201d she pointed out, before following him down a flight of stairs into the cold sterile cavern that was the Columbus City Police Department Morgue.</p>\n<p>The body was on the table, still covered by a blanket. Sage pulled out her notepad, ready to start taking notes.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo we have an identification yet?\u201d Sage asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cI had Joseph run a check. Harris Lee, 32-year-old drug dealer. No one special.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMakes sense,\u201d Sage bent down to start on the physical examination. Testing the elbow to see if it bent, she confirmed that rigour mortis was definitely already setting in. Cutting away his clothing and marking it into evidence bags, West searched the skin, noting down cuts and scrapes, and checked his fingernails for grime or residue.</p>\n<p>She began to lift the cloth to look at his face- and immediately felt a wave of pusback to her memetic protection, a physical force that vibrated over her skin like a magnet. Chanting the phrase inked to her arms in Sharpie, she pushed the cloth back down, taking a moment to breathe. Whatever it was, it was powerful.</p>\n<p>\u201cHelp me flip him over,\u201d she asked Jack, thrusting a pair of gloves at him. Grimacing, he quickly put them on. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ever bring backup?

It was Agent Jack \u201cJackrabbit\u201d Marlene, known to the Franklin County Police Department as Detective Darren Hazel (when he wasn\u2019t working for the NYCPD as Detective Sergei Solokov). The man with many names was usually a tolerable guy - a great buddy for a night of duck pin bowling and cocktails, at least.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis about Loveland?\u201d she asked, leaning back into her chair. Ezekiah Lenora shot her an odd look from across the room, and West just winked in turn. \n\n\n\n\u201cNah. Not [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sage-west-s-guide-to-keeping-up-disappearances a Disappearances case.] Not yet, at least. We just got a new stiff in, and it\u2019s looking like it might be anomalous.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cHow long?\u201d Sage stood, readying herself to grab her car keys and bolt. \n\n\n\n\u201cAbout a half an hour. I\u2019ve stuck some wrenches into procedure so the evidence doesn\u2019t get shipped to the labs too soon.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d Sage smirked, satisfied. \u201cNice going, chief. I\u2019ll be on route in five, over in thirty if I\u2019m quick.\u201d\n\n\n\nJackrabbit laughed, as Sage quickly tapped Levi on the shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m heading out for a meeting. Tell Novak I\u2019m off shift, and give her my regards,\u201d she gave a smug smile, and Levi sighed. \u201cShe\u2019ll bite your head off about this later, y\u2019know. I\u2019m not sure how you haven\u2019t been actually killed by Reynolds.\u201d\n\n\n\nDirector Emerald Reynolds and Assistant Director/Chemistry Department Head Celeste Novak were a formidable alliance at the worst of times, and a united front ruling over a godless realm of terror at their best. Thankfully, Reynolds was one of the few people who knew Sage\u2019s involvement in Disappearances. And that was damn helpful.\n\n\n\nOf course, that didn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t still make Sage\u2019s life hell for it. \n\n\n\nWest pulled up the puffy white coat over her shoulders, tugging up the fur-lined hood and holding the phone in place with her chin. \u201cGive me the run-down on the case.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d he started. \n\n\n\nHer Jeep beeped a greeting, doors unlocking as she slid inside and turned the call to speaker, engine revving as she pulled out. Cruising out from the Site 404 parking lot, she hit the road at about 20 miles above the speed limit. A free hand fumbled for a hairband shoved into the seat cushions, quickly twisting up the French braid she had sported into a neat ginger loop at the base of her neck.\n\n\n\nWest had already made the mistake of forgetting to tie her hair up at a crime scene before, and had paid in the mess scrubbing dried blood out of her hair left on her tiles. Oh, and the gross factor and all that. Though it\u2019d been a while since Sage had actually cringed at the sight of blood. \n\n\n\n\u201cWe did an initial sweep of the primary scene and Joseph spotted the guy pretty quickly. Cops wouldn\u2019t let us in for a bit, but once it was clear the guy was done for, I was able to get a good look. The actual process seemed to go smoothly, but as soon as the guys with me saw his face, they started talking about him like they knew him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cPersonally?\u201d Sage asked, noting it down into the margins of her mind. \n\n\n\n\u201cNo, more tangentially. Carlie said she\u2019d seen him on a game show from the 90s, and Joseph thinks he was featured as a guest speaker at an old forensics lecture he\u2019d seen on tape. No physical contact connections, and no one mentioned anything more recent than 2006. I asked.\u201d\n\n\n\nSage hummed, adding another five miles to her speed limit hating pace. \u201cDid you get a look at him?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cNope,\u201d Jackrabbit clicked his tongue. \u201cI showed up late to the scene and thankfully heard Carlie and Joseph\u2019s stories before I got too close. Skipped out on the ambulance ride and took my car back to the station so I could call you in private.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Sage ran her tongue over her teeth and began puzzling out the possibilities in her head. Memetic effect, possible cognitohazard. \u201cDid you have any trouble walking away from it?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI mean, I was curious, but it wasn\u2019t\u2026 shit, now that you mention it. Joseph said all three of the guys who found the body walked over there right after they arrived. Definitely could be some kind of anomalous compulsion playing into it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, mind-effecting,\u201d Sage concluded. \u201cIf this is memetic, it\u2019s isolated enough to be on the weaker side. Otherwise, you\u2019d be under the effect just from talking to the hive mind minions.\u201d\n\n\n\nJackrabbit snorted from on the other end of the line. \u201cAre you ever nice?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t make a habit of it,\u201d Sage replied simply, checking her lipstick in the rearview mirror. She hated walking into a crime scene looking anything but her best. Thankfully, the look was still intact, and her small ginger figure cut as imposing a figure as ever. \u201cI\u2019m still waiting for an email about the My Little Foundation: Containment Is Magic pitch.\u201d\n\n\n\nJackrabbit actually laughed at this. \u201cNow that\u2019s just genuinely awful.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cGood. We\u2019re on the same page.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cWhere are you now?\u201d Jackrabbit asked, ignoring her cynicism.\n\n\n\n\u201cAbout fifteen minutes away.\u201d At this point, Sage\u2019s foot was pedal to the metal, roaring the car like a bullet down the highway. It was pure Ohio in that the only use the road got was from people crossing through to get to another state worth their time, and extra helpful in the fact that it didn\u2019t lead many worthwhile places. That made it the perfect spot to hide away a few large blocky white buildings, easily mistaken as storage units to those with a less discerning eye. \n\n\n\nThe closer to Columbus she sped, though, the more drivers popped up, and the more likely it was for Sage to face actual repercussions for the strange, maniacal replication of good driving she specialised in. The one time Sage had carpooled 404 Director Emerald Reynolds, it\u2019d ended with Sage kicked to shotgun, after about ten minutes of Reynolds white-knuckling the door handle and snapping at every slight movement in the window. \n\n\n\nSome people just weren\u2019t built for her lifestyle, West considered. \n\n\n\n\u201cJesus Christ\u2026\u201d Jackrabbit groaned, counting himself happily amongst the \u201csome people\u201d. \u201cWell, I\u2019m en route to enter the station in under five. See you out front.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cGot it, boss,\u201d Sage purred, just as the phone hung up. \n\n\n\nIt was showtime. \n\n\n\n\u2014-\n\n\n\nIt was hard to be intimidating when you barely reached five feet tall on a good day. But Sage West managed it. The trick was knowing her own worth - and then some. Nothing makes a grown man more embarrassed than being told his job has been usurped by a 27-year-old ginger with a fur collar bigger than her head. And West delighted in that. \n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for Detective Hazel,\u201d she snapped as she strode in through the doors, ready to boss around whatever officer ended up having the misfortune of being the first to find her.\n\n\n\nShe was slightly disappointed when Jackrabbit himself was the voice to respond. \u201cRight here, Doc.\u201d He leaned against the wall, arms crossed. Long puffy dijon coat, over black slacks and a simple button-up. Dark hair messy and olive skin flushed with the cold. \n\n\n\n\u201cAh. Darren,\u201d she pursed her lips. \u201cWhat\u2019s the latest?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI got the body set up downstairs for you. Do you need anything?\u201d As good of an Agent as he was, he still wasn\u2019t as skilled in the specifics of handling anomalies as she was. He was mainly there to pick them out and handle things while he waited for people like her to arrive.\n\n\n\n\u201cNope. Hold on a second,\u201d she whipped out her phone, shooting a message to one of her Department of Disappearances colleagues. \n\n\n\n//Handling a cognitohazardous meme that infects victims who view it. Need to counter it.//\n\n\n\nA long pause- and then a reply. Three dots waiting, before-\n\n\n\n//Get a sharpie and write a power phrase on your arms and throat. That might be able to create a protective counter meme. If you start to go under, just touch the words and say them out loud.//\n\n\n\nSage shot back - //got it// and whistled to Jackrabbit. \u201cI need a sharpie.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe fumbled, grabbing one off the desk, and handing it over. Wordlessly, she pulled back her sleeves and collar, writing the words \u201cYOU DO NOT RECOGNISE THIS MAN\u201d in large black letters. Capping it, she handed it back. \u201cShould I do the same?\u201d Jack questioned, eyeing her.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be as effective for you. I\u2019ve got training in memetic blocking to back me up,\u201d she pointed out, before following him down a flight of stairs into the cold sterile cavern that was the Columbus City Police Department Morgue.\n\n\n\nThe body was on the table, still covered by a blanket. Sage pulled out her notepad, ready to start taking notes. \n\n\n\n\u201cDo we have an identification yet?\u201d Sage asked. \n\n\n\n\u201cI had Joseph run a check. Harris Lee, 32-year-old drug dealer. No one special.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMakes sense,\u201d Sage bent down to start on the physical examination. Testing the elbow to see if it bent, she confirmed that rigour mortis was definitely already setting in. Cutting away his clothing and marking it into evidence bags, West searched the skin, noting down cuts and scrapes, and checked his fingernails for grime or residue. \n\n\n\nShe began to lift the cloth to look at his face- and immediately felt a wave of pusback to her memetic protection, a physical force that vibrated over her skin like a magnet. Chanting the phrase inked to her arms in Sharpie, she pushed the cloth back down, taking a moment to breathe. Whatever it was, it was powerful.\n\n\n\n\u201cHelp me flip him over,\u201d she asked Jack, thrusting a pair of gloves at him. Grimacing, he quickly put them on. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ever bring backup? That way I don\u2019t have to touch any dead bodies.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI like you better,\u201d Sage said, not dishonestly. Jack grunted. \u201cI can\u2019t tell whether that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cProbably not,\u201d Sage said, as they carefully lifted the heavy corpse, turning him onto his back. Sage began her process again, while Jack continued his new goal of looking like a very uncomfortable lemon. \u201cBut if you\u2019re going to be here, might as well make yourself useful. Hang on-\u201d \n\n\n\nSomething caught her eye - and she bent down, careful not to touch the skin directly as she pushed up the cloth near his neck. \n\n\n\nIt was a small triangle, carved into the skin with some kind of blade. A thin silvery kind of ink stained the lines, and West knew that this was it. \u201cFound it. He has a sigil on his neck.\u201d\n\n\n\nJack walked around to inspect it, raising an eyebrow. \u201c//That\u2019s// the thing that\u2019s making everyone freak out?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSage shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m going to guess that there\u2019s an original source. It\u2019s like a\u2026 gang symbol, almost. The gang\u2019s power is from the actual members, but if you have their symbol, you could carry some of that influence.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOr you\u2019ve just been watching too much Breaking Bad,\u201d Jack suggested as if he wasn\u2019t the one who had gotten her hooked on the series in the first place. \n\n\n\nSage pulled out her phone and snapped a few pictures of the mark, before setting her mind to the best course of action. \u201cScalpel?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jack said, though he still handed it over.

Even the crickets\u2019 song was strangely silent, as if the insects had gone to sleep that night to rest their collective voice. The quiet was broken, and even then only barely so, by the bubbling and light splashing of a turtle rising to the surface from the riverbed. The earthy odor of the flourishing spring grass, nourished by heavy rain and the great surging Yangtze, nearly overpowered the landscape. Truly, it would\u2019ve been all that filled one\u2019s nose if not for the smell of gunpowder and steel pervading the land.</p>\n<p><em>Boom</em>.</p>\n<p>The first blast of the Japanese artillery rang out. A zealous officer wanted the honor of beginning the bombardment.</p>\n<p><em>Boom</em>.</p>\n<p>He fired another shell.</p>\n<p><em>Boom</em>.</p>\n<p>Rushing to their stations, the quickest of the Chinese artillerymen returned fire with a single shot.</p>\n<p><em>Boom. Boom. Boom</em>.</p>\n<p>A symphony of explosions erupted on either side of the field. Firing under the concealment of the tree canopy, rows upon rows of guns opened up. Infantry temporarily retreated to safety of underground dugouts, and airmen filed out to the runways.</p>\n<p>But the crashing of shells and whistling of mortar, though disturbing to the birds and causing the rats to scurry to their holes, were but a distant and waning concert to the 20 or 30 dark silhouettes marching through the black forest. Far behind Japanese lines and guided only by firefly, feel, and experience, their objective seemed out of reach to any outside observer. Even some of the men there thought such was so.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>W\u01d2men d\u00e0od\u01d0 w\u00e8ish\u00e9me y\u00e0o l\u00e1i zh\u00e8l\u01d0</em>?\u201d A disgruntled man muttered.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>W\u01d2men zh\u01d0 q\u00f9 f\u00e9nm\u00f9</em>.\u201d His equally unhappy comrade agreed quietly. At this, the man at the front of the group stood to the side and stopped, waiting until the discontented pair caught up to him. Once he was at their side, he shoved one of the men into the other. He began to chastise them severely in a hushed, furious tone. If it weren't for the need for quiet, he would\u2019ve likely yelled his message to them.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t go too hard on them, Mingyu. I\u2019d think this was a suicide mission too if I knew as much as you\u2019ve told them.\u201d An out of place American voice, speaking in English, came from just in front of the back of the band. Mingyu scoffed and sped up his pace to meet the American man. He seemed out of place among the Chinese guerrillas, wearing leather, jeans, and a casual button-up beneath his jacket. But the confident expression on his grizzled, handsome face made it seem like he felt right at home.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is lieutenant, doctor,\u201d responded the officer in heavily accented English, scowling. \u201cLieutenant Dai Mingyu, People\u2019s Liberation Army.\u201d The American smirked. The officer, dressed the most formally of all the peasant soldiers, stood out by wearing a cap with a red star and clean glasses as well as a field worker's light cotton. He had piercing eyes that stabbed daggers into any man he wished to unsheath them on with a stare. Any man but the American. He had seen them in plenty of men.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, alright, take it easy now.\u201d He said.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you can suffer to call me lieutenant, and I can call you doctor, Mr. Rockwell, there will be peace. Otherwise, I can guarantee you nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lieutenant Dai paused for a moment. The band began to cross a small creek, stepping from rock to rock as a path across the ankle-deep, flowing water. In the far off battle, the sounds of propellers and dropping bombs joined the ensemble. The officer continued.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd who do <em>you</em> think you are, judging how I lead my own men?\u201d Dai continued.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one,\u201d Rockwell responded. \u201cBut it wouldn't hurt that they know why they're fighting, that's all my point.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want to discuss why we fight? Where did you get all this information we\u2019ve based the entire attack on, doctor? I still await an answer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Rockwell frowned. The band had crossed the creek. Faint lights began to become visible through the thick forest.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThus I cannot trust you.\u201d Rockwell sighed and rolled his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen have I ever let you down?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lieutenant Dai grunted. He spat to his side. Rockwell continued.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe will never need to see each other again after this. Let\u2019s try not to get into it for just one last time.\u201d Lieutenant Dai did not respond. No one spoke for some time after.</p>\n<p>Finally, the band exited the forest, stopping short at the treeline of a large clearing. Every man fell crouched just at the edge of the darkness, out of sight of those who may be occupying their objective.</p>\n<p>Maybe 1000 feet up a moderately-sloped hill lay the site of a Japanese camp. With every lamp on and spotlights sweeping across the land, it seemed that the encampment would be bustling with the activity of an army at full strength. However, besides the lights, the entire area sounded and looked very quiet. No soldiers or trucks were seen or heard, at least from where the guerrillas were.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere will be no eastern devils, doctor? I will not send my men into their deaths.\u201d Lieutenant Dai asked, hushed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have said it before. They\u2019re on the attack to take Yichang, three miles southwest.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re clearly manning the spotlights. If you're wrong, we will all die.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a tiny garrison, and that\u2019s it. There are less of them than us, and we have the element of surprise.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lieutenant Dai paused.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour head is on the line. Let us have victory.\u201d The lieutenant raised his voice slightly.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>R\u00e0ng w\u01d2men k\u0101ish\u01d0 ba</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Sh\u00ec de</em>!\u201d The men of the band responded, though certainly not at appropriate volume for a cheer. At that, everyone fell to their stomachs, and the guerrilla group began to crawl towards the Japanese camp. On his belly, Rockwell felt his shoulder holster uncomfortably pushed up through his armpit. The leather piece was not designed to be pressed against the dirt, especially when worn by a crawling man.</p>\n<p>The distance to their objective was not far from the treeline. The green of the tents and the illuminating light poles were easily visible over the crest of the hill, even from the bottom. Along the way, they\u2019d only need to cross a clear slope of grass, bar a few possible unseen rocks. However, the threat of detection loomed. A spotlight, always on guard for intruders, slowly crossed the hill face like a pendulum. Back and forth, back and forth. So the communist cell hugged the earth, slowly scaling the slope up to the camp.</p>\n<p>Each man was spread across a large area on the hillside, alone or in pairs. Rockwell found himself next to Private Luo, a very large man who didn\u2019t speak much. Whenever food was brought into the safehouse, he always ate three times the ration. He also did three times the work whenever there was a need to lift or move anything, being the first man Lieutenant Dai always called for.</p>\n<p>Rockwell, though a PhD, found himself to be behind the curve when it came to avoiding spotlights. A quick learner, he observed how the guerrillas did it. They never stopped moving, determined to stay exposed on the hillside for as little as possible. When the light crept up to where he was about to crawl, Private Luo slowed down, letting it pass before going. Private Chen, a wiry man often picked to run messages between cells, would break from his crawl and run forward hunchbacked. No matter how close the light was, Chen was determined to race it, and he always succeeded.</p>\n<p>Rockwell had kept up well. The band was maybe 100 feet from climbing to the top of the hill. The doctor had been using a two-wheeled cart sitting at the very edge of the summit as his goal, as passing it would mean he had entered the plateau on which the camp was built. The threat of the spotlight was nearly passed. Though it was slowly creeping toward him, it was of no concern; he could easily get out of the way, he thought. Rockwell quickened his pace to get out of the way of the light. He was unable to move, and felt a pull along his shoulder holster.</p>\n<p>\u201cShit.\u201d He mumbled quietly. He tried to move by force, crawling with more strength yet again. He only received a stronger pull around his chest. The searchlight came closer.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot now.\u201d Rockwell mumbled again, coolheaded but not so confident anymore. He patted around the spot of his snag. After feeling a few handfuls of earth and grass, he found the issue: Rockwell had managed to run into one of the few rocks on the hillside. A peculiarly hooked stone, embedded in the dirt, had caught the leather straps of his shoulder holster.</p>\n<p>The glow of the spotlight began to overpower the view to Rockwell\u2019s right, as the very edge of it was nearly upon him. It was a matter of seconds before he was exposed to the Japanese, and they would defend the camp to the death. He quickly worked the straps, finding that two of them that connected near his rib were both hooked on the rock.</p>\n<p>The light grew closer.</p>\n<p>Rockwell pulled the vertical strap free.</p>\n<p>The light was the length of a man away.</p>\n<p>Rockwell pulled the horizontal strap free.</p>\n<p>The right side of Rockwell\u2019s body began to be illuminated by the dim glow of the spotlight\u2019s edge.</p>\n<p>Rockwell jumped forward, scraping by just as the spotlight swooped by where he was just moments before. He took a moment to breathe. He looked behind him. The light had continued on its way, seemingly oblivious to the doctor\u2019s presence. Rockwell was certain that he had been seen, but it seemed he had gotten lucky this time.</p>\n<p>With the guerrillas unaware of Rockwell\u2019s near-miss, and him certainly not rushing to tell them about it, the band reached the camp without word on his incident. They met behind the cart at the edge of the camp, barely illuminated by the lights of the camp. The two dozen hid to the best of their ability, the two wheels, combined with the blocks underneath, providing some height to obscure their crouching figures. Lieutenant Dai whispered to his own men in his own language, before turning to Rockwell.</p>\n<p>\u201c-And Dr. Rockwell can take whatever he wants, and thus we can end our relationship\u2026cordially.\u201d Rockwell nodded. He understood the goal of Dai\u2019s men: to kill the few Japanese in the camp and take as much guns and ammunition that they could carry out.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay out of your way. It was a pleasure working with you, lieutenant.\u201d Rockwell responded with much more sincerity on his face than in his heart. With that, Dai exchanged a few more words with the guerillas, and they all rose and entered the camp silently.</p>\n<p>Rockwell began to casually walk on his own into the camp. The Chinese spread out in groups of five to eliminate their enemy. Fighting was their responsibility. The only reason he\u2019d even taken them along was to ensure the few Japanese guards left in the camp were no threat to him, and even then he only brought them for that purpose under heavy protest. Rockwell spent hours trying to convince his boss that he didn\u2019t need help, that going alone was more safe and efficient, but he was told that their presence was mandatory. Why, he asked? New security protocols for field agents, demanded by the brass from the top. Too costly to give out so many bereavement packages for all the agents killed in the warzones that had popped up in the past couple years. Rockwell knew better than to argue with the bureaucracy. At the very least he compromised to take a band he actually had some history with, not the new group of Nationalist insurgents his boss thought would be the most competent.</p>\n<p>Walking down the lanes of tents, light poles, and stacked boxes, the doctor heard the sounds of the Chinese doing their own part. Shots occasionally rang out, but that was only the main course of a full accompaniment of scattered screams, shouted exclamations, and all manner of wood being pried and destroyed. Rockwell was slightly concerned when he saw a Japanese soldier leaning against a pole not far in front of him. The young soldier seemed deaf when a Chinese man sprinted up from behind him and ran him through with a bayonet, not reacting at all to the sound of him running. When Rockwell walked by the dead man, the blood leaking from his mouth seemed to source from a smile.</p>\n<p>Eventually, after a long but straight shot deep into the camp, Rockwell found what he was looking for: a great big tent, with no windows or openings other than a cloth door. A big pile of crates stacked in the most peculiar way adjacent to the tent, the one where a private was breaking open a box with a crowbar, marked his objective. Rockwell noticed a crate was precariously placed on the edge of another just above the man's head. A small movement could cause it to fall.</p>\n<p>\"<em>Xi\u01ceox\u012bn, xi\u0101ngzi hu\u00ec di\u00e0o d\u00e0o n\u01d0 sh\u0113nshang</em>.\" Rockwell said, warning the man of the danger.</p>\n<p>\"<em>Q\u00f9 s\u01d0 ba</em>.\" The guerrilla said with derision, not even turning to face Rockwell. The doctor shrugged. His funeral if he wanted to be a hardhead.</p>\n<p>A sign was planted at the door, with kanji stating to all who saw it \u201c<strong>DO NOT ENTER</strong>\u201d. Here, Rockwell was briefed, he would find his prizes. As the doctor was stepping inside, he felt a hand being placed on his shoulder. He whipped around to see Lieutenant Dai.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is it, Mingyu? You said we were done.\u201d Rockwell asked, annoyed. The officer made a sour face and snorted before responding.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust this.\u201d He said. Rockwell sighed deeply.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy the hell not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have found maybe eight or nine eastern devils. The men in the watchtowers have boarded themselves in with boards and chairs. They didn't even know we were coming, yet their doors are blocked. I have a feeling-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cListen, there\u2019s no one here. If you\u2019re worried, take what you need and leave. Just stay out of my way.\u201d Rockwell concluded with a huff. As Dai turned red and wore an expression of indignation, the doctor entered the tent. He had no patience for the petty concerns of the communists.</p>\n<p>A lit lamp hung from the ceiling at the intersection of the tent poles, illuminating the space with an orangish tint. Inside those green walls lay tables and piles of priceless treasures, the spoils of the 11th Army marauding and looting through central China. Rockwell took in a breath, enjoying the smell of the ancient.</p>\n<p>A display of colorful, adorned samurai armor was the most striking feature on the east wall. Small crates and boxes, themselves ornate and beautiful, were filled to the brim with gold and jewels and lined up against the wall of the tent. Artifacts, like classical pottery, swords, and idols were organized on several tables. Pallets were loaded with assorted precious stones.</p>\n<p>Though Rockwell was not shy to help himself to a few loose jewels, he was not there for regular old metal and crystals. He, instead, turned to the table that was completely unorganized, which appeared to be the least valuable of them all. It was labeled with a piece of paper that said \u201c\u666e\u901a\u3067\u306a\u3044\u201d, or \u201cunusual\u201d. This table, left unorganized and with items scattered about, seemed uncared for. However, he knew they were the most valuable of all.</p>\n<p>Rockwell immediately recognized the <em>Jinjiao Jian</em>, the Scissors of the Golden Scaly Dragons. With golden handles like a dragons' heads and blades like sharp teeth, it was written that the artifact took in heavenly energy to be able to cut through anything. The doctor was found it to be surprisingly heavy. There was the beautifully molded <em>Luobao Jingqian</em>, the Treasure-Defeating Gold Coin, which made useless magic and projectiles, and the <em>Ruyi Jingu Bang</em>, the Monkey King's cudgel that adjusted to any size. He saw the <em>Wanya Hu</em>, the Pot of Ten Thousand Crows which Luo Xuan used to burn down an entire city.</p>\n<p>\"I guess the princess didn't destroy it.\" Rockwell thought. He had read <em>Romance of Gods</em> as part of his doctorate research, and it is written that the pot, an ornate teapot made of jade, was destroyed for its power. That book was usually accurate, but it seemed that there was evidence for a new error in the text.</p>\n<p>Following protocol, Rockwell quickly jotted down all he saw. He knew he couldn't carry everything out. The priceless spears, staffs, and swords were too big to take with him, so the news of their existence and location would be the most valuable thing he could bring back home.</p>\n<p>When finished writing, Rockwell began filling his sack with the smaller priceless treasures. Even if he from time to time took the liberty to pad it with normal artifacts, his bag was meant to take these anomalous objects with him. And so he did, working as quickly as possible. He was pleasantly surprised to see Wukong's cudgel fit in his sack snugly, even if he tried to place it inside when it was five feet long.</p>\n<p>As Rockwell, struggling with the space already taken up by loot, was trying to stuff the Scissors of the Golden Scaly Dragons in through the cramped opening of the bag, he heard the footsteps of someone entering the tent. Very focused, he did not immediately turn to see the person.</p>\n<p>\"Dr. Rockwell?\" The voice said clearly. It was Lieutenant Dai.</p>\n<p>\"Mingyu? What is it?\" Rockwell asked, not even concerned to look at him. After a moment, the doctor was surprised to then hear a clicking sound. It was unmistakably recognizable as a pistol, the officer having cocked it to be ready to fire. That certainly got his attention, and Rockwell swiftly turned to face the officer. He took a deep breath.</p>\n<p>\"Lieutenant Dai.\" Rockwell said, calmly and fearlessly.</p>\n<p>\"Ah, the bird sings a new song.\" Lieutenant Dai replied smugly, grinning ear to ear. He pointed his pistol at Rockwell and held it at his hip.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re truly nothing more than a thief? Color me\u2026unsurprised.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re the one saying this? Now?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lieutenant Dai laughed.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe supplies we have borrowed will come back to the eastern devils sometime or another, even if not in the way they\u2019d like. But you\u2026you\u2019re simply a bandit, blinded by the glitter of gold.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never thought this before? At least, you've never seemed bothered.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm not so foolish. But given our work together is done, and you know far too much about this cell\u2019s activities for any single man bar me and Chairman Mao, I believe the time to act is now. I have given the order to the men that your time is up.\"</p>\n<p>Rockwell took a moment to think before speaking.</p>\n<p>\u201cLieutenant Dai, listen-\u201d</p>\n<p>Rockwell stepped forward, and Lieutenant Dai raised the pistol to a firing position. Rockwell took the hint, and stepped back before continuing, resting one hand on a crate of stolen items to his right and using the other to emphasize his points.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I tell you the truth?\u201d</p>\n<p>The officer raised his eyebrow, prompting Rockwell to continue.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to take just any of this-\u201d the doctor motioned his hand towards the boxes of gold and gems, \u201c-no, but for these things.\u201d Rockwell turned towards the table of unusual items. \u201cThey're pieces of history, yes, but they're\u2026different. They don't make sense in our understanding of the world. You-\"</p>\n<p>\"They're magical?\" Lieutenant Dai butted in.</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" Rockwell continued, \"If that's how you want to say it. I need to take these home so they can be studied, so we can improve the world. Isn't that what Chairman Mao would do? For the new China?\" Rockwell concluded, ending his speech with a salesman's grin.</p>\n<p>Lieutenant Dai took a moment to think. He then scoffed.</p>\n<p>\"You know nothing about Chairman Mao, or his vision. The new China will have no place for such superstition. You are no better than any other foreign devil, taking the history of my people as spoil.\"</p>\n<p>Lieutenant Dai paused for a moment, then laughed.</p>\n<p>\"If you really want to help Chairman Mao's vision for a new China, we need money, and these things will fetch a\u2026<em>handsome</em>, price.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'll help carry them out for you.\"</p>\n<p>Lieutenant Dai laughed once again.</p>\n<p>\"No, Mr. Rockwell, I believe your time has already run far past its course. Goodbye.\"</p>\n<p>As soon as Lieutenant Dai finished speaking, both men\u2019s ears were perked by the rise of noise outside the tent. The occasional gunshot and yell of a man suddenly erupted into a new chorus of barked orders, war cries, blaring of alarms, and the beginning of several firefights all throughout the camp. Dai, looking around the tent in confusion, spared the American for a moment.</p>\n<p>\"What is that? What have you done?\"</p>\n<p>\"Nothing!\" Rockwell replied emphatically.</p>\n<p>Silently, as Lieutenant Dai stood uncertain of what to do, a pine cone shaped object rolled from the tent door across the grassy floor. The object gingerly stopped near the room's entrance, tapping on the officer's heel. Dai looked downward to find a grenade, primed with the pin removed, sitting right at his feet. He went bug-eyed at the sight. Seeing the officer distracted, Rockwell ducked behind the crate to his right.</p>\n<p>\"<em><strong>H\u00fand\u00e0n!</strong></em>\" Screamed Lieutenant Dai as the grenade exploded, launching the officer several feet across the tent. Seeing it was safe, Rockwell stepped out from hiding. He began to walk to the door. Passing by, he glanced at Lieutenant Dai. The man's legs were badly scorched and torn, and he had landed face down on a pallet loaded with jade artifacts and stolen jewelry.</p>\n<p>\"Use <em>that</em> for the new China, Mingyu.\" Rockwell mumbled in passing. He then exited the tent. It was time to get out of there.</p>\n<p>Stepping outside, the chaotic scene surrounded Rockwell. The first thing to catch his eye was the marker of his objective, the crate pile near him. It was missing several boxes, and many others left were cracked open, their contents of mortar shells clearly visible.</p>\n<p>He looked to his right. From the large rectangular medical tent, easily seen halfway across the camp, came a stream of Japanese soldiers, as men were rushing onto the new battlefield. Even if the battle had started more than a minute before, there were still more emerging from the tent door. Through the gaps of the tent city, he saw the occasional soldier running through the narrow walkways. All around him, small-scale fighting between men on either sides, be it with fist, knife, or gun, choked out his viable routes of escape. The Japanese had laid a trap, and Rockwell was stuck in the center of it. The only way out seemed to be where he came, straight ahead and back into the forest.</p>\n<p>Rockwell took barely a step forward before he felt a pull from the sack of treasures slung on his back. In a moment, the doctor was yanked backwards with incredible force, falling to the ground on his posterior. He looked up to see his attacker, and there stood Private Luo. The big man\u2019s round face, usually stern and indifferent, was uncharacteristically transformed by a toothy smile.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>D\u011bng y\u012bxi\u00e0, w\u01d2 l\u00e1i ji\u011bsh\u00ec y\u012bxi\u00e0</em>.\u201d Asked Rockwell, needing just a moment to breathe and reassess.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>B\u00f9</em>.\u201d Simply responded the soldier, denying the doctor\u2019s request for a moment\u2019s peace. His face turning to anger, Luo raised his foot high, intending to bring it back down on Rockwell. The doctor rolled to the side, avoiding the attack, and he started to scurry off to his left. Luo\u2019s foot already on the ground, he swung it to the left as he drove it against Rockwell\u2019s right side, making the doctor wince but giving the momentum for his crawl to make some distance from his attacker.</p>\n<p>Rockwell faced the private. Luo ducked his head and charged towards the doctor in a shoulder bash. Rockwell quickly reached for his shoulder holster and drew his revolver. Before he could fire a shot, Luo collided with him at full force, knocking Rockwell backwards and sending his gun flying.</p>\n<p>Both men thinking they\u2019d found their trump card, Luo drew the pistol from his waist, and Rockwell retrieved the Scissors of the Golden Scaly Dragons, its handles sticking out from his sack. Luo aimed the pistol at Rockwell and cocked it, but, as he did so, the doctor brought the open blade of the scissors down on the barrel of the gun. As Luo pulled the trigger, the entire length of the barrel of his weapon was sheared off, and no shot fired.</p>\n<p>Surprised, Luo threw his destroyed weapon to the side. With uncharacteristic reflexes, he caught Rockwell\u2019s wrist as he tried to swing the golden scissors back up his abdomen, stopping himself from being cut in two. He squeezed with all his strength, his massive hands wrapping all the way around Rockwell\u2019s lower forearm. Both men stared into each other\u2019s eyes for several moments, each steeling their resolve facing down the other. Rockwell held onto the scissors for as long as possible, but Luo was far too strong, and the doctor was forced to drop his only weapon.</p>\n<p>With the loss of the golden scissors, Rockwell was reinvigorated with survival instinct. With his free hand, he squarely punched Luo in the jaw, before getting two more good hits to the face. The guerrilla responded by using one hand to defend his head and the other to shove Rockwell away. Luo, a head taller than Rockwell and no longer filled with his typical stoicism, advanced on Rockwell. Both men exchanged blows for a short time, but Rockwell soon found himself becoming more battered and exhausted than his enemy. With the strength and reach advantage, Luo struck more often and harder, and both knew that the outcome of the fight was only a matter of time.</p>\n<p>With Rockwell\u2019s strength running low, he quit his backpedaling and pivoted forward. He struck Luo once in the face, and once in the chest. This seemed the last straw for the man, and he pounced on Rockwell, landing on top of him in the ground. Luo began to strangle Rockwell with both hands. Rockwell tried to free his neck with all his might, but found himself low on strength. Unable to stop the stranglehold, he used one hand to punch Luo in the face, but the guerrilla refused to let go.</p>\n<p>Things started going fuzzy. Rockwell began to think his road had come to an end here, in the forests of Hubei. With little struggle left to avoid resignment to that fate, suddenly, the sound of a deafening explosion completely enveloped him, and all that he heard was white noise. Luo collapsed on top of Rockwell, and a violent force was shot through the guerrilla that felt as if it shoved Rockwell further into the ground. Smoke began to rise from Luo\u2019s back, and the man released his stranglehold.</p>\n<p>Rockwell pulled Luo's hands off his neck and took several deep breaths, desperate but happy to be alive. His stroke of luck pumping him with a new round of adrenaline, he rolled the big man's body off of him and stood up.</p>\n<p>Rockwell's senses soon began to return with the airflow. Looking towards Luo, a massive burnt dent mark filled his entire upper back. Rockwell then turned towards the pile of crates. He saw a thin Japanese soldier, eyes closed and nearly doubled over. His hand was placed on an open crate of mortar shells.</p>\n<p>Rockwell, his hearing returning, quickly made out what the soldier was doing. He was laughing the heartiest laugh the doctor had ever heard in all his adventures. Putting two and two together, Rockwell realized the soldier had tossed an active mortar shell squarely on Luo's back. If the guerrilla had not been such a big man, Rockwell would likely have died with him. And the enemy sergeant thought it was funniest thing. But that didn't all sink in with the doctor at once.</p>\n<p>\"<em>Arigat\u014d</em>.\" Rockwell said shakily, still catching his breath. He meant it sincerely. The soldier had saved his life.</p>\n<p>Hearing the word, the Japanese man straightened up. He thought Rockwell certainly would've been killed by the blast. He delayed a moment as he stared at the doctor, unsure of what to do. Coming to his senses, he then pulled another shell from the crate, and he tossed it at Rockwell.</p>\n<p>The light whistle of the shell spelled doom for the doctor. Thinking quickly, and still full of adrenaline, he quickly lifted up the corpse of Luo and pressed it against himself where he stood. The guerrilla was nearly too much for the doctor to hold, and he certainly couldn't do it for long, but for the moment he had he braced himself against the body to the best of his ability.</p>\n<p>As the bomb fell short of Rockwell, Luo took the brunt of the explosion and was sent flying to the side. The doctor was pushed to the ground and back several feet, being dragged along the grass by the force of the shell. Though dazed, bruised, and cut up, Rockwell was certainly still alive, and the Japanese man was eager to finish the job.</p>\n<p>Rockwell knew he needed an out, and using dead men as shields would not cut it again. The soldier was soon to throw yet another shell, and his aim might've improved the second time. Rushedly scanning his surroundings, he looked to his left, and found that he'd stopped right next to the Scissors of the Golden Scaly Dragons, which had fallen to the ground before.</p>\n<p>As the Japanese man reached for another mortar shell, Rockwell retrieved the golden scissors and rose to his feet. He rose it over his head, and threw it directly at the enemy's head like a tomahawk. Quick to his wits, the soldier ducked, and the scissors instead were lodged behind him in an unopened crate just above his head, the box just barely placed at the edge of a lower crate in a very precarious position.</p>\n<p>\"<em>Naisushotto</em>.\" Said the Japanese, chuckling. He pulled out another shell. Though he jested, he knew he had Rockwell beat.</p>\n<p>Rockwell stood still, chuckling quietly to himself. The golden scissors, lodged in the crate's side, had shifted the balance of weight. As the soldier prepared to toss another shell, the crate impaled with the scissors fell from its place. It landed on the soldier's head, its heavy contents knocking him out cold as it fell on top of him. The shell fell from his hand, and exploded only to his harm as both he and it struck the ground.</p>\n<p>Rockwell, pleased with himself, grinned and walked over to the body.</p>\n<p>\"<em>Arigat\u014d.</em>\" He said, pulling the golden scissors from the crate. Placing it precariously once more in his sack, still having barely enough room as to have the handles stick out, he began to walk in the direction in which he came, finally ready to leave.</p>\n<p>Rockwell moved quickly retracing his path. As he followed the route, he ducked and weaved through the cover of boxes and tents around the several fights taking place right in his way. He hid behind a crate before a Chinese man shoved his Japanese opponent down the way past Rockwell, and the doctor had a chance to scurry by without being involved in their knife fight. By passing these final two men, the only thing that was left between Rockwell and escape was the two-wheeled cart and the open hill it was placed on.</p>\n<p>Coming near the cart, suddenly, Rockwell was shoved from behind, seemingly bashed with the end of a narrow object. He was pushed into the cart, landing face first but quick to flip onto his back and see his attacker.</p>\n<p>Above him stood a glaring Japanese soldier. He was holding his gun by the barrel, having been using it as a club. The man, baring his teeth, adjusted his grip and raised the rifle to his shoulder, aiming at Rockwell. As the soldier slid the bolt forward, Rockwell rolled to the other side of the tiny cart. The soldier fired, but missed, creating a hole in the center of the shoddy cart's wooden floor, previously only covered with hay. As the ferocious man slammed another round into the chamber, Rockwell covered his face with his arms, before another shot rang out.</p>\n<p>Rockwell opened his eyes and moved his arms. Blood was leaking from his attacker's head. The man fell to his right. Rockwell, still on edge, could only catch his breath for a moment as he heard a courageous war cry. Lieutenant Chen ran up to where the dead man once stood, quickly retrieving the Japanese rifle now laying on the floor. He raised it to his shoulder and took aim at Rockwell. The doctor braced for impact once again, but a crack rang out and Chen's head whipped to the left in a moment. He had been shot too, and, as he fell to the ground, he dropped the rifle at Rockwell's feet.</p>\n<p>Rockwell, confused, sat up to figure out what had just happened. The lighting at the camp's edge was barely sufficient. Turning to his left, he saw men in Japanese caps crouched under a watchtower and surrounded by metal barrels for cover. They had their rifles slung over the barrels, aiming straight down the hill. They had certainly been watching for any guerrilla attempting to escape down the hill. The barrels emanated a pungent odor of oil.</p>\n<p>To Rockwell's right, he saw men wearing peasant clothes, those he knew as Chinese guerrillas, ready with their rifles placed over a pile of crates. They must've been carrying the munitions out of the camp before the fighting had pinned them down, so they'd set up shop where they stood. The crates, certainly full of munitions and explosives, were now makeshift cover.</p>\n<p>For a moment, the screams and gunshots filling the air seemed to cease all at once. All was quiet for a moment.</p>\n<p><em>Crack</em>!</p>\n<p>Rockwell, having set his sack of treasures aside, quickly ducked down into the cover of the cart, laying flat on his back so the short walls on either side shielded him. The singular shot was only the first of many, as the Chinese and Japanese realized the presence of the other. All hell broke loose as a storm of fire opened up just above Rockwell's head. He was stuck right in the middle of a firefight, and worse, low shots began to chip away at his cover. Once it was destroyed, there'd be no protection from the crossfire.</p>\n<p>Pinned, Rockwell knew his only escape was the cart. He began pushing his body against the vehicle, banging into it with all his strength, but it wouldn't budge. Even pushing off of the ground just in front of his cover was no good. Pressure began to mount, as every lousy shot allowed either enemy to lower their aim even more. One stray round could spell the end to the doctor's adventures.</p>\n<p>Looking to see what was stopping him, Rockwell peeked his eye through the hole created by the dead Japanese attacker's rifle shot. In the dim light, he saw wooden blocks placed on each of the cart's wheels. They were the obstacles keeping it in place.</p>\n<p>In a snap decision, Rockwell jumped up to move the blocks by hand. He only could sit up for a moment, but he was able to glance briefly at the combatants. In what he could see, both sides were assembling machine guns, be it their own or stolen. Though they were both not set up yet, the mere rifle fire forced Rockwell to snap back to his senses and lie back into cover as a bullet zipped just past his nose.</p>\n<p>Rockwell knew that when those machine guns got firing, they'd tear through his flimsy fortress in mere seconds, the old wood already on its last legs. Yet, there was no way to move the blocks without facing the same fate as the two dead men at his feet. For a moment, he thought that the situation was impossible.</p>\n<p>But Rockwell did not survive all his adventures by giving up. Scanning the area within arm's reach, only one tool was available: the rifle two men had tried to gun him down with. The firearm now laying at his feet, he carefully pulled it into his cover. Through the chips in the cart's side he saw the tops of the heads of the tallest Japanese and Chinese soldiers. Rockwell coughed several times as he began to be overpowered by the smell of oil, the bullet-ridden barrels used for cover by the Japanese leaking heavily.</p>\n<p>Rockwell stopped for a moment. He knew he couldn't fight his way out, and going out in a blaze of glory seemed less than ideal. There had to be another way.</p>\n<p>Thinking quickly, Rockwell found his final lifeline. He held the gun like a club and huddled up against as much cover as he could. Using all his strength, the doctor brought the butt of the rifle down on the little hole in the floor of the cart.</p>\n<p><em>Crash.</em></p>\n<p>The wood gave way a little, warping downwards. Rockwell gave it another hit.</p>\n<p><em>Crash.</em></p>\n<p>It broke up a little more. Rockwell, his face lit up, bashed the floor once more.</p>\n<p><em>Crash!</em></p>\n<p>A hole the size of the rifle\u2019s butt was opened where the little spot once was. His smirk growing, Rockwell adjusted his grip and slid the barrel of the gun through the hole. Holding the rifle from the butt, the doctor could just barely reach the blocks with the muzzle. He struggled for a moment, making several attempts to move the left block to the side properly. Peeking his head up slightly towards the Japanese, their machine gun was nearly fully assembled. The Chinese were certainly not far behind.</p>\n<p>With a final push, he found success. The first block was out of the way, and only the right one remained. As he positioned the rifle to move the final block away, Rockwell had a realization. He'd certainly be exposed as he rolled away, and there would be no defense from the potshots of both armies. As he thought about this, both armies were placing their fully assembled Nambu machine guns on top of their cover.</p>\n<p>Rockwell reached into his bag and retrieved the <em>Luobao Jingqian</em>, the Treasure Defeating Gold Coin. When thrown into the air, it could stop arrows and magic bolts. The doctor gave the coin a kiss for luck and tossed it upwards. Then, as the machine gun crews of his enemies had their fingers on the trigger, he shoved the final wooden block away with his gun, and off the cart went down the hill. The sudden jerking motion of the cart beginning its roll pulled the rifle under the hole. His hands now free, the doctor hung on to the shattered sides of his vehicle and braced himself for what could be an abrupt, violent stop.</p>\n<p>As Rockwell began moving, several soldiers turned to fire at his cart. Unbeknownst to them, their task was impossible. The Treasure Defeating Gold Coin activated, floating and vibrating in the air. The artifact then froze every shot aimed at Rockwell, suspending their rounds in the air just past the soldiers' vision. They vibrated just like the coin, still full of their previous momentum. Unaware of the futility of their actions, crouched men fired both at Rockwell and their enemies. Indeed, even the machine gunners, entranced by handling such a powerful weapon, seemed to ignore their tracers freezing en route to their targets. Hundreds of frozen rounds filled the air in moments.</p>\n<p>As Rockwell raced far away from the scene of the battle, the gold coin's effect ran its course, and it fell to the ground inert. Without the coin's power, all at once, every bullet suspended in the air zipped to its target at once. Hundreds of tiny powder kegs crashed into the Japanese already crumpled and leaking oil barrels on one side, and even more barraged the splintered and nearly destroyed crates of shells and munitions hoarded by the Chinese. The unintentional bomb created by the two armies could take the abuse no longer, and both the oil barrels and the munitions crates exploded at once in a spectacular fireball. The inferno, consuming the two groups of fighting men, rose into the air, signaling to all the disaster that had consumed them.</p>\n<p>Finishing his bumpy ride down a particularly rock-laden stretch of the hill, the cart quickly slowed down as the side not supported by wheels acted as brakes for the vehicle as it dug into the earth. Rockwell briefly turned to glance at the fireball he had created up the hill. He chuckled slightly, then, keeping his mind on escape, jumped up from his seat and broke into a sprint for the cover of the woods. It felt something fell out of his bag, but he had no time to look back.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Tomare</em>!\u201d A voice shouted from the woods. As Rockwell was just about to enter the treeline, a Japanese soldier jumped up in front of him from his hiding spot. He brandished his rifle, tipped with a shining bayonet, and with a crazed look in his eye began to run towards Rockwell. The doctor tried to avoid him, turning sharply for another spot on the treeline. But, just as he was about to escape from the field, another Japanese man, a sergeant based on the insignia on his shoulder, emerged from the brush. Rockwell had no time to react as the man bashed him in the stomach with his rifle's butt, knocking him doubled-over on his back.</p>\n<p>On the ground, Rockwell instinctually curled up and covered his face as the soldier let loose several cruel kicks into his side, back, and head. The sergeant accompanied his abuse with twisted laughs, bordering on cackling. The doctor had only a brief time to consider fighting back, as he saw the other soldier rush over to his comrade. He raised his rifle, ready to plunge his bayonet into the man on the ground. Rockwell braced himself.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Yamete! Baka-tomo</em>!\u201d A gruff, authoritative voice yelled from the forest. Rockwell was relieved to see both his attackers turn away from him and towards the treeline. Both of them shouldered their weapons and stood at attention. In a few short moments, a furious man stomped over to the young soldiers and slapped each of them across the face. He began to scream at them in Japanese, letting them know just how foolish they were.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t need to call them idiots,\u201d Rockwell said with a cough, \u201cThey were just doing their jobs.\u201d The angry man, clearly an officer, looked down at Rockwell. He surprised the doctor by lightly laughing.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou speak my language.\u201d The officer stated, speaking in a strange accent, mixing the speech mannerisms of the Japanese and the South English.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you speak mine.\u201d Rockwell responded matter-of-factly. \u201cYou went to school abroad?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOxford. Class of 1932.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"No kidding. What'd you study?\" At this, the Japanese man's face lit up slightly.</p>\n<p>\"I was a student of history, with a focus on East Asia in the late classical and early modern periods. I wrote my dissertation on the Great Unifier Oda-\"</p>\n<p>\"Nobunaga!\" Rockwell butted in. Humanizing himself with his captor would probably be the best way to avoid ending up with a bullet in the head. \"What a man! The Sengoku period was maybe the best thing I studied back at Berkeley, certainly more interesting than when we started slogging through the Tokugawa Shogunate. God, I hated that.\" The officer did his best, but could not contain a little smile.</p>\n<p>\"Really? You also studied the Far East? I can only hope you learned in class that while samurai in battle are honorable and glorious, there is also value to the unity and order in peace.\"</p>\n<p>\"I understand that. I was just a dumb college kid, is all.\" He paused for a moment. \"I have to ask, how did you get into Oxford? Your family is well off?\u201d The officer\u2019s softened expression turned sour.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is that to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing, nothing.\u201d Rockwell internally kicked himself for that misstep. Nobody spoke for a moment, until the officer continued.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou may get up now, unless you wish to continue lying in the dirt.\u201d Rockwell rose from the ground, finally getting an eye-to-eye look at the officer. He was nearly the doctor\u2019s height, rising above most of the men they were surrounded by. His clean green khaki uniform, kept to the tee of Japanese military standards, spoke for itself his dedication to his occupation and country. His sharp features were accentuated by the dim orange glow of the massive fire raging on the top of the hill. Above all, his strong, piercing eyes projected power and authority that not even Lieutenant Dai could achieve when pointing a gun at a man. That power and authority was accentuated all the more by the half dozen Japanese soldiers emerging from the brush and standing side by side with their officer. Even if Rockwell was clearly unarmed, two of them always kept their rifle trained on the foreigner.</p>\n<p>The officer cleared his throat and pointed at the inferno. The Japanese, victorious in the battle, had begun to deploy fire brigades to quench the flame.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is your handiwork?\u201d He asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cI played no part in any of this.\u201d The officer chuckled at Rockwell's claim.</p>\n<p>\u201cLiar.\u201d With nowhere left to go in this conversation, Rockwell fell back on his training.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am an American national. The United States and the Japanese Empire are not at a state of war. If I am harmed-\u201d The officer cut him off.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can face serious consequences in a domestic or international court of law, or even extradition to the United States to face justice.\u201d He finished. Even as Rockwell kept a poker face, he was taken aback. How did this random officer know the immunity spiel? The Japanese man continued.</p>\n<p>\"No sir, I know the little speech you've been taught to give upon capture. Your allegiance is not with America, even if both her and your masters share the same cowardly and decadent tendencies. You are one of\u2026<em>them</em>.\" The officer spat out his final word with derision, his previously amused expression beginning to twist into a disgust his enlisted men shared. He too had finally considered the fact that, at least in his eyes, Rockwell had surrendered like a coward.</p>\n<p>\"I don't know what you're talking about.\" Rockwell feigned. The officer sighed, and continued with more frustration in his voice.</p>\n<p>\"We thought you'd come while the army was away, and we planned for an armed escort to come with you. But with those degenerates, <em>communists</em>-\" The officer spoke that word with so much hate and distrust that it was like saying it was the worst taboo, \"-? Even that we thought was below you gang of thieves. What made you think you could rob Japan of her rightful treasures under her nose?\" The officer spoke with clear restrained anger, like a father chastising his son. Rockwell exhaled deeply. It was clear the man would not be fooled.</p>\n<p>\"So the jig is up, huh?\"</p>\n<p>The officer nodded lightly. At that, Rockwell felt a strange peace.</p>\n<p>\"I don't think we've properly been introduced. My name is Silas Rockwell, Doctor and Field Agent of the SCP Foundation.\" The officer nodded again.</p>\n<p>\"Captain Masuya Kobayashi, <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ijamea-hub\">Imperial Japanese Anomalous Matters Examination Agency</a> .\" Captain Masuya said it like he was going to accompany his statement with a salute. Speaking to a foreign dog, he, of course, restrained himself.</p>\n<p>\"IJAMEA? I'm glad to say I'm quite familiar.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh? What have you come to know about the agency? Please, speak your mind.\" Knowing that, because he hadn't been killed yet, and that he probably was wanted alive, a little bit of snark bled through his filter.</p>\n<p>\"I know you're the fanatics of the fanatics. The naval and army schools recommend only the most crazy about the empire to you.\" Captain Masuya dropped whatever was left of his cordial smile, then, raising his gloved hand, slapped Rockwell across the face. Silas took a moment before turning again to face the officer.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou asked for honesty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"'Patriotic' is the word we look for, Dr. Rockwell. Only those with the <em>Yamato-damashii</em> of ten men have the honor to serve the Emperor's Agency.\" Neither man spoke for a moment before Rockwell continued.</p>\n<p>\"So that's why those guys barely fought back when we came in, huh? They were the most 'patriotic'? They had the most \u2018Japanese spirit?\u2019\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes. It is a shame we lost such brave men today, and an even greater one you dishonor them now, but it was necessary for victory.\" Masuya thought for a moment, then laughed mockingly.</p>\n<p>\"How did your superiors not notice such an obvious trap?\"</p>\n<p>Rockwell took a moment before responding. \"They never told me much. I was just told to go find the tent with your anomalies, that a stacked box of crates would mark it, and that there would be almost no one to stop me.\"</p>\n<p>\"Your superiors didn't even tell you how they learned of classified army plans?\" Rockwell shook his head. He was told that the Japanese would be away and why, but he didn't know where the info came from. Captain Masuya snorted and spat to his side.</p>\n<p>\"Typical treacherous western dogs. Our superiors came together not long ago to discuss the movements of the emperor's army. Your leading men claimed they wanted to know such information so they could follow leads on suspected artifacts without coming into our crossfire. But this is not the first case of Foundation deceit. We spoiled them with information, where individual divisions would come and go in the recent weeks, and specifics of our camps, even which ones held our treasures. Then is when we told them the entire army you've just robbed from would be away on the attack tonight. And so we lay in wait for you, certain you would come on this night.\" Rockwell kept a brave face, but inside, he felt his heart drop. He had been the fool all along.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you decided to stay out of the fighting by hiding in the forest?\u201d Rockwell asked with some disdain, wishing to earn back a little of his bruised pride.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo not get brazen with me. My assignment was to seize or kill fleeing enemies of Japan. I have fulfilled my orders.\u201d Masuya answered, more defensively than angrily. Rockwell waited a moment before speaking again.</p>\n<p>\"So, what happens now?\" Silas asked. Masuya remained firm.</p>\n<p>\"You will come with us to Tokyo, and you will tell us everything you know. That's the best you deserve-\" the captain paused for a moment, \"-thief.\"</p>\n<p>Masuya then noticed a golden glimmer maybe 20 feet behind Rockwell created by the warm glow of the flame on the hill, which was now losing the battle with the firecrews. Masuya walked over to it, his men following closely behind him. Now Rockwell turned to face back up the hill. There was no physical thing left between him and the forest, but two soldiers still kept aim at the doctor. The captain reached down and picked up the Scissors of the Golden Scaly Dragons. That must've been what Rockwell dropped from his bag.</p>\n<p>\"And it is all for this? You have become a thief, an enemy of Japan for the <em>Kogane no Hasami</em>? Was it worth it, Mr. Rockwell? What can your Foundation do with this?\"</p>\n<p>\"The <em>Jinjiao Jian</em>? I was simply following orders to take it. You know a thing or two about that.\" Masuya scowled at this remark.</p>\n<p>\"No <em>Chinese</em> name will be used for an object in the service of the empire. Come. We are returning to camp.\" The captain then turned to walk back up the hill. Several of his men also began returning up the hill, but the two still aiming their rifles at Rockwell stayed in place and motioned with their weapons for the doctor to join them.</p>\n<p>\"And my bag?\" Rockwell asked.</p>\n<p>\"Not even the lowliest servant of the emperor is below you. You will return it to its rightful place yourself.\" Masuya replied, not stopping his walk. Though a statement intended to be intimidating, it, along with the fire on the hill, suddenly gave Rockwell an idea.</p>\n<p>\"Now hold on a second, captain.\" Rockwell said. \"I think you should know this before your men go through my bag.\"</p>\n<p>\"What?\" Replied Masuya, his patience worn thin by the American. He turned to face the prisoner, sneering down his nose from his elevated stance on the hill.</p>\n<p>Taking a few steps forward, Rockwell closed a bit of the distance. Rockwell then pulled his sack to his stomach, and he briefly dug through it. He then pulled a little jade teapot, the <em>Wanya Hu</em>, out of his bag. Captain Masuya was the only one to react, the sharp daggers in his eyes becoming dull at the sight. Rockwell removed the lid of the pot.</p>\n<p>\"<em>Happ\u014d se-!</em>\" Was all Captain Masuya managed to get out before he was knocked to the ground. However, instead of firing their weapons as ordered, the soldiers, just like their commanding officer, were all knocked about and to the dirt by the mass of flaming crows unleashed by the <em>Wanya Hu</em>. Dozens of burning birds, all spewing from one opening, flew panicked into the Japanese, their caws mingling with screams of pain and desperation from their victims. The crows pecked at the men as if a finger through water, and their talons sliced at them as a knife through butter. All the while, their infernal bodies burned any man they touched. The soldiers were nearly powerless as they tried to swat away the avians with their hands and rifles.</p>\n<p>Rockwell, seeing his chance, struggled to cap the <em>Wanya Hu</em>. After beating an obstructive crow's head back into the pot with the lid, he finally sealed the item's power once more. He then made a break for the woods, his would-be jailers unable to stop him. A few soldiers from the top of the hill took shots at the doctor, but no man in the IJAMEA was such a good shot. Rifle rounds kicking up dust behind him, Rockwell ducked into the treeline, out of their sight.</p>\n<p>Soldiers from the camp rushed from their old fire in order to extinguish the new one engulfing their brothers in arms. They ran down with water buckets, shovelfuls of dirt, and coats, spilling soil and water as they ran at full speed. In a short time, some reached their struggling comrades, and they swatted at the birds with shovels and coats. The crows were driven back a bit from the wounded on the ground. The bucket brigades came soon after, and dumped cool water onto the writhing soldiers. Water seemed to be the crow's undoing, and those doused in it were washed off to the side, seemingly dead. The remaining animals then flew off into the night, looking as if they lost their flaming properties as they disappeared out of sight.</p>\n<p>The saviors of the soldiers called for stretcher bearers quickly, the wounded in critical condition. Most of the men seemed dead on the spot; Captain Masuya was still breathing, though deeply struggling each second.</p>\n<p>\"<em>Masuya sench\u014d</em>!\" An enlisted man exclaimed as he took in the sight of the captain.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>In the dark woods, Rockwell patted the bag on his back; good, it didn't seem to be missing anything else. The <em>Jinjiao Jian</em> would have to be an acceptable loss. He still held the <em>Wanya Hu</em> for defense, but with every passing second, it seemed more and more likely the IJAMEA were not following him. He knew where the Foundation safehouse was, and it would take him a day to get there, so Rockwell decided he could walk for a bit.</p>\n<p>The artillery ceased as the doctor walked. Even after his night's excitement, the battle between the Chinese Nationalists and the Imperial Japanese Army was just beginning. The battle cries of men were heard faintly from where Rockwell stood, certainly infantry rising from their dugouts to meet the enemy, but he had no intention to join them. His battle was over for tonight. As far as Rockwell was concerned, he had a rest and a drink in order when he returned home.</p>\n<p>As Rockwell thought further, he realized that he may have fought his battle for the day, but, like a soldier, it would certainly not be his last. The only question was when he would next be put in the field for another adventure.</p>\n<p>He stopped for a moment. Rockwell thought again. He decided that they could put a raise on top of that drink.</p>\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h2><span><strong>Silas Rockwell will return in \"Silas Rockwell and the Heavenly Reflection\".</strong></span></h2>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/silas-rockwell-and-the-reflection-of-heaven-prologue\">Silas Rockwell and the Reflection of Heaven (Prologue)</a>\" by Blue Foot, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Even the crickets\u2019 song was strangely silent, as if the insects had gone to sleep that night to rest their collective voice. The quiet was broken, and even then only barely so, by the bubbling and light splashing of a turtle rising to the surface from the riverbed. The earthy odor of the flourishing spring grass, nourished by heavy rain and the great surging Yangtze, nearly overpowered the landscape. Truly, it would\u2019ve been all that filled one\u2019s nose if not for the smell of gunpowder and steel pervading the land.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0//Boom//. \n\n\n\nThe first blast of the Japanese artillery rang out. A zealous officer wanted the honor of beginning the bombardment.\n\n\n\n//Boom//. \n\n\n\nHe fired another shell.\n\n\n\n//Boom//.\n\n\n\nRushing to their stations, the quickest of the Chinese artillerymen returned fire with a single shot.\n\n\n\n//Boom. Boom. Boom//.\n\n\n\nA symphony of explosions erupted on either side of the field. Firing under the concealment of the tree canopy, rows upon rows of guns opened up. Infantry temporarily retreated to safety of underground dugouts, and airmen filed out to the runways.\n\n\n\nBut the crashing of shells and whistling of mortar, though disturbing to the birds and causing the rats to scurry to their holes, were but a distant and waning concert to the 20 or 30 dark silhouettes marching through the black forest. Far behind Japanese lines and guided only by firefly, feel, and experience, their objective seemed out of reach to any outside observer. Even some of the men there thought such was so.\n\n\n\n\u201c//W\u01d2men d\u00e0od\u01d0 w\u00e8ish\u00e9me y\u00e0o l\u00e1i zh\u00e8l\u01d0//?\u201d A disgruntled man muttered.\n\n\n\n\u201c//W\u01d2men zh\u01d0 q\u00f9 f\u00e9nm\u00f9//.\u201d His equally unhappy comrade agreed quietly. At this, the man at the front of the group stood to the side and stopped, waiting until the discontented pair caught up to him. Once he was at their side, he shoved one of the men into the other. He began to chastise them severely in a hushed, furious tone. If it weren't for the need for quiet, he would\u2019ve likely yelled his message to them.\n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t go too hard on them, Mingyu. I\u2019d think this was a suicide mission too if I knew as much as you\u2019ve told them.\u201d An out of place American voice, speaking in English, came from just in front of the back of the band. Mingyu scoffed and sped up his pace to meet the American man. He seemed out of place among the Chinese guerrillas, wearing leather, jeans, and a casual button-up beneath his jacket. But the confident expression on his grizzled, handsome face made it seem like he felt right at home.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat is lieutenant, doctor,\u201d responded the officer in heavily accented English, scowling. \u201cLieutenant Dai Mingyu, People\u2019s Liberation Army.\u201d The American smirked. The officer, dressed the most formally of all the peasant soldiers, stood out by wearing a cap with a red star and clean glasses as well as a field worker's light cotton. He had piercing eyes that stabbed daggers into any man he wished to unsheath them on with a stare. Any man but the American. He had seen them in plenty of men.\n\n\n\n\u201cAlright, alright, take it easy now.\u201d He said.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you can suffer to call me lieutenant, and I can call you doctor, Mr. Rockwell, there will be peace. Otherwise, I can guarantee you nothing.\u201d\n\n\n\nLieutenant Dai paused for a moment. The band began to cross a small creek, stepping from rock to rock as a path across the ankle-deep, flowing water. In the far off battle, the sounds of propellers and dropping bombs joined the ensemble. The officer continued.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd who do //you// think you are, judging how I lead my own men?\u201d Dai continued.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo one,\u201d Rockwell responded. \u201cBut it wouldn't hurt that they know why they're fighting, that's all my point.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou want to discuss why we fight? Where did you get all this information we\u2019ve based the entire attack on, doctor? I still await an answer.\u201d\n\n\n\nRockwell frowned. The band had crossed the creek. Faint lights began to become visible through the thick forest.\n\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThus I cannot trust you.\u201d Rockwell sighed and rolled his eyes.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen have I ever let you down?\u201d\n\n\n\nLieutenant Dai grunted. He spat to his side. Rockwell continued.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe will never need to see each other again after this. Let\u2019s try not to get into it for just one last time.\u201d Lieutenant Dai did not respond. No one spoke for some time after.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the band exited the forest, stopping short at the treeline of a large clearing. Every man fell crouched just at the edge of the darkness, out of sight of those who may be occupying their objective. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Maybe 1000 feet up a moderately-sloped hill lay the site of a Japanese camp. With every lamp on and spotlights sweeping across the land, it seemed that the encampment would be bustling with the activity of an army at full strength. However, besides the lights, the entire area sounded and looked very quiet. No soldiers or trucks were seen or heard, at least from where the guerrillas were.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThere will be no eastern devils, doctor? I will not send my men into their deaths.\u201d Lieutenant Dai asked, hushed.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI have said it before. They\u2019re on the attack to take Yichang, three miles southwest.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re clearly manning the spotlights. If you're wrong, we will all die.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tiny garrison, and that\u2019s it. There are less of them than us, and we have the element of surprise.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lieutenant Dai paused.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYour head is on the line. Let us have victory.\u201d The lieutenant raised his voice slightly.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201c//R\u00e0ng w\u01d2men k\u0101ish\u01d0 ba//.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201c//Sh\u00ec de//!\u201d The men of the band responded, though certainly not at appropriate volume for a cheer. At that, everyone fell to their stomachs, and the guerrilla group began to crawl towards the Japanese camp. On his belly, Rockwell felt his shoulder holster uncomfortably pushed up through his armpit. The leather piece was not designed to be pressed against the dirt, especially when worn by a crawling man.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The distance to their objective was not far from the treeline. The green of the tents and the illuminating light poles were easily visible over the crest of the hill, even from the bottom. Along the way, they\u2019d only need to cross a clear slope of grass, bar a few possible unseen rocks. However, the threat of detection loomed. A spotlight, always on guard for intruders, slowly crossed the hill face like a pendulum. Back and forth, back and forth. So the communist cell hugged the earth, slowly scaling the slope up to the camp. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each man was spread across a large area on the hillside, alone or in pairs. Rockwell found himself next to Private Luo, a very large man who didn\u2019t speak much. Whenever food was brought into the safehouse, he always ate three times the ration. He also did three times the work whenever there was a need to lift or move anything, being the first man Lieutenant Dai always called for.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rockwell, though a PhD, found himself to be behind the curve when it came to avoiding spotlights. A quick learner, he observed how the guerrillas did it. They never stopped moving, determined to stay exposed on the hillside for as little as possible. When the light crept up to where he was about to crawl, Private Luo slowed down, letting it pass before going. Private Chen, a wiry man often picked to run messages between cells, would break from his crawl and run forward hunchbacked. No matter how close the light was, Chen was determined to race it, and he always succeeded.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rockwell had kept up well. The band was maybe 100 feet from climbing to the top of the hill. The doctor had been using a two-wheeled cart sitting at the very edge of the summit as his goal, as passing it would mean he had entered the plateau on which the camp was built. The threat of the spotlight was nearly passed. Though it was slowly creeping toward him, it was of no concern; he could easily get out of the way, he thought. Rockwell quickened his pace to get out of the way of the light. He was unable to move, and felt a pull along his shoulder holster.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cShit.\u201d He mumbled quietly. He tried to move by force, crawling with more strength yet again. He only received a stronger pull around his chest. The searchlight came closer.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNot now.\u201d Rockwell mumbled again, coolheaded but not so confident anymore. He patted around the spot of his snag. After feeling a few handfuls of earth and grass, he found the issue: Rockwell had managed to run into one of the few rocks on the hillside. A peculiarly hooked stone, embedded in the dirt, had caught the leather straps of his shoulder holster.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The glow of the spotlight began to overpower the view to Rockwell\u2019s right, as the very edge of it was nearly upon him. It was a matter of seconds before he was exposed to the Japanese, and they would defend the camp to the death. He quickly worked the straps, finding that two of them that connected near his rib were both hooked on the rock.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The light grew closer.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rockwell pulled the vertical strap free. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The light was the length of a man away.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rockwell pulled the horizontal strap free.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The right side of Rockwell\u2019s body began to be illuminated by the dim glow of the spotlight\u2019s edge.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rockwell jumped forward, scraping by just as the spotlight swooped by where he was just moments before. He took a moment to breathe. He looked behind him. The light had continued on its way, seemingly oblivious to the doctor\u2019s presence. Rockwell was certain that he had been seen, but it seemed he had gotten lucky this time.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With the guerrillas unaware of Rockwell\u2019s near-miss, and him certainly not rushing to tell them about it, the band reached the camp without word on his incident. They met behind the cart at the edge of the camp, barely illuminated by the lights of the camp. The two dozen hid to the best of their ability, the two wheels, combined with the blocks underneath, providing some height to obscure their crouching figures. Lieutenant Dai whispered to his own men in his own language, before turning to Rockwell.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201c-And Dr. Rockwell can take whatever he wants, and thus we can end our relationship\u2026cordially.\u201d Rockwell nodded. He understood the goal of Dai\u2019s men: to kill the few Japanese in the camp and take as much guns and ammunition that they could carry out.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll stay out of your way. It was a pleasure working with you, lieutenant.\u201d Rockwell responded with much more sincerity on his face than in his heart. With that, Dai exchanged a few more words with the guerillas, and they all rose and entered the camp silently.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rockwell began to casually walk on his own into the camp. The Chinese spread out in groups of five to eliminate their enemy. Fighting was their responsibility. The only reason he\u2019d even taken them along was to ensure the few Japanese guards left in the camp were no threat to him, and even then he only brought them for that purpose under heavy protest. Rockwell spent hours trying to convince his boss that he didn\u2019t need help, that going alone was more safe and efficient, but he was told that their presence was mandatory. Why, he asked? New security protocols for field agents, demanded by the brass from the top. Too costly to give out so many bereavement packages for all the agents killed in the warzones that had popped up in the past couple years. Rockwell knew better than to argue with the bureaucracy. At the very least he compromised to take a band he actually had some history with, not the new group of Nationalist insurgents his boss thought would be the most competent.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Walking down the lanes of tents, light poles, and stacked boxes, the doctor heard the sounds of the Chinese doing their own part. Shots occasionally rang out, but that was only the main course of a full accompaniment of scattered screams, shouted exclamations, and all manner of wood being pried and destroyed. Rockwell was slightly concerned when he saw a Japanese soldier leaning against a pole not far in front of him. The young soldier seemed deaf when a Chinese man sprinted up from behind him and ran him through with a bayonet, not reacting at all to the sound of him running. When Rockwell walked by the dead man, the blood leaking from his mouth seemed to source from a smile. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Eventually, after a long but straight shot deep into the camp, Rockwell found what he was looking for: a great big tent, with no windows or openings other than a cloth door. A big pile of crates stacked in the most peculiar way adjacent to the tent, the one where a private was breaking open a box with a crowbar, marked his objective. Rockwell noticed a crate was precariously placed on the edge of another just above the man's head. A small movement could cause it to fall.\n\n\n\n\"//Xi\u01ceox\u012bn, xi\u0101ngzi hu\u00ec di\u00e0o d\u00e0o n\u01d0 sh\u0113nshang//.\" Rockwell said, warning the man of the danger.\n\n\n\n\"//Q\u00f9 s\u01d0 ba//.\" The guerrilla said with derision, not even turning to face Rockwell. The doctor shrugged. His funeral if he wanted to be a hardhead.\n\n\n\nA sign was planted at the door, with kanji stating to all who saw it \u201c**DO NOT ENTER**\u201d. Here, Rockwell was briefed, he would find his prizes. As the doctor was stepping inside, he felt a hand being placed on his shoulder. He whipped around to see Lieutenant Dai.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat is it, Mingyu? You said we were done.\u201d Rockwell asked, annoyed. The officer made a sour face and snorted before responding.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t trust this.\u201d He said. Rockwell sighed deeply.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhy the hell not?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe have found maybe eight or nine eastern devils. The men in the watchtowers have boarded themselves in with boards and chairs. They didn't even know we were coming, yet their doors are blocked. I have a feeling-\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cListen, there\u2019s no one here. If you\u2019re worried, take what you need and leave. Just stay out of my way.\u201d Rockwell concluded with a huff. As Dai turned red and wore an expression of indignation, the doctor entered the tent. He had no patience for the petty concerns of the communists.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A lit lamp hung from the ceiling at the intersection of the tent poles, illuminating the space with an orangish tint. Inside those green walls lay tables and piles of priceless treasures, the spoils of the 11th Army marauding and looting through central China. Rockwell took in a breath, enjoying the smell of the ancient.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A display of colorful, adorned samurai armor was the most striking feature on the east wall. Small crates and boxes, themselves ornate and beautiful, were filled to the brim with gold and jewels and lined up against the wall of the tent. Artifacts, like classical pottery, swords, and idols were organized on several tables. Pallets were loaded with assorted precious stones.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Though Rockwell was not shy to help himself to a few loose jewels, he was not there for regular old metal and crystals. He, instead, turned to the table that was completely unorganized, which appeared to be the least valuable of them all. It was labeled with a piece of paper that said \u201c\u666e\u901a\u3067\u306a\u3044\u201d, or \u201cunusual\u201d. This table, left unorganized and with items scattered about, seemed uncared for. However, he knew they were the most valuable of all.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rockwell immediately recognized the //Jinjiao Jian//, the Scissors of the Golden Scaly Dragons. With golden handles like a dragons' heads and blades like sharp teeth, it was written that the artifact took in heavenly energy to be able to cut through anything. The doctor was found it to be surprisingly heavy. There was the beautifully molded //Luobao Jingqian//, the Treasure-Defeating Gold Coin, which made useless magic and projectiles, and the //Ruyi Jingu Bang//, the Monkey King's cudgel that adjusted to any size. He saw the //Wanya Hu//, the Pot of Ten Thousand Crows which Luo Xuan used to burn down an entire city.\n\n\n\n\"I guess the princess didn't destroy it.\" Rockwell thought. He had read //Romance of Gods// as part of his doctorate research, and it is written that the pot, an ornate teapot made of jade, was destroyed for its power. That book was usually accurate, but it seemed that there was evidence for a new error in the text.\n\n\n\nFollowing protocol, Rockwell quickly jotted down all he saw. He knew he couldn't carry everything out. The priceless spears, staffs, and swords were too big to take with him, so the news of their existence and location would be the most valuable thing he could bring back home. \n\n\n\nWhen finished writing, Rockwell began filling his sack with the smaller priceless treasures. Even if he from time to time took the liberty to pad it with normal artifacts, his bag was meant to take these anomalous objects with him. And so he did, working as quickly as possible. He was pleasantly surprised to see Wukong's cudgel fit in his sack snugly, even if he tried to place it inside when it was five feet long.\n\n\n\nAs Rockwell, struggling with the space already taken up by loot, was trying to stuff the Scissors of the Golden Scaly Dragons in through the cramped opening of the bag, he heard the footsteps of someone entering the tent. Very focused, he did not immediately turn to see the person.\n\n\n\n\"Dr. Rockwell?\" The voice said clearly. It was Lieutenant Dai.\n\n\n\n\"Mingyu? What is it?\" Rockwell asked, not even concerned to look at him. After a moment, the doctor was surprised to then hear a clicking sound. It was unmistakably recognizable as a pistol, the officer having cocked it to be ready to fire. That certainly got his attention, and Rockwell swiftly turned to face the officer. He took a deep breath.\n\n\n\n\"Lieutenant Dai.\" Rockwell said, calmly and fearlessly.\n\n\n\n\"Ah, the bird sings a new song.\" Lieutenant Dai replied smugly, grinning ear to ear. He pointed his pistol at Rockwell and held it at his hip.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re truly nothing more than a thief? Color me\u2026unsurprised.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re the one saying this? Now?\u201d\n\n\n\nLieutenant Dai laughed.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe supplies we have borrowed will come back to the eastern devils sometime or another, even if not in the way they\u2019d like. But you\u2026you\u2019re simply a bandit, blinded by the glitter of gold.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve never thought this before? At least, you've never seemed bothered.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm not so foolish. But given our work together is done, and you know far too much about this cell\u2019s activities for any single man bar me and Chairman Mao, I believe the time to act is now. I have given the order to the men that your time is up.\"\n\n\n\nRockwell took a moment to think before speaking.\n\n\n\n\u201cLieutenant Dai, listen-\u201d\n\n\n\nRockwell stepped forward, and Lieutenant Dai raised the pistol to a firing position. Rockwell took the hint, and stepped back before continuing, resting one hand on a crate of stolen items to his right and using the other to emphasize his points.\n\n\n\n\u201cCan I tell you the truth?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe officer raised his eyebrow, prompting Rockwell to continue.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to take just any of this-\u201d the doctor motioned his hand towards the boxes of gold and gems, \u201c-no, but for these things.\u201d Rockwell turned towards the table of unusual items. \u201cThey're pieces of history, yes, but they're\u2026different. They don't make sense in our understanding of the world. You-\"\n\n\n\n\"They're magical?\" Lieutenant Dai butted in.\n\n\n\n\"Yes,\" Rockwell continued, \"If that's how you want to say it. I need to take these home so they can be studied, so we can improve the world. Isn't that what Chairman Mao would do? For the new China?\" Rockwell concluded, ending his speech with a salesman's grin. \n\n\n\nLieutenant Dai took a moment to think. He then scoffed.\n\n\n\n\"You know nothing about Chairman Mao, or his vision. The new China will have no place for such superstition. You are no better than any other foreign devil, taking the history of my people as spoil.\"\n\n\n\nLieutenant Dai paused for a moment, then laughed.\n\n\n\n\"If you really want to help Chairman Mao's vision for a new China, we need money, and these things will fetch a\u2026//handsome//, price.\" \n\n\n\n\"I'll help carry them out for you.\"\n\n\n\nLieutenant Dai laughed once again.\n\n\n\n\"No, Mr. Rockwell, I believe your time has already run far past its course. Goodbye.\"\n\n\n\nAs soon as Lieutenant Dai finished speaking, both men\u2019s ears were perked by the rise of noise outside the tent. The occasional gunshot and yell of a man suddenly erupted into a new chorus of barked orders, war cries, blaring of alarms, and the beginning of several firefights all throughout the camp. Dai, looking around the tent in confusion, spared the American for a moment.\n\n\n\n\"What is that? What have you done?\"\n\n\n\n\"Nothing!\" Rockwell replied emphatically.\n\n\n\nSilently, as Lieutenant Dai stood uncertain of what to do, a pine cone shaped object rolled from the tent door across the grassy floor. The object gingerly stopped near the room's entrance, tapping on the officer's heel. Dai looked downward to find a grenade, primed with the pin removed, sitting right at his feet. He went bug-eyed at the sight. Seeing the officer distracted, Rockwell ducked behind the crate to his right.\n\n\n\n\"//**H\u00fand\u00e0n!**//\" Screamed Lieutenant Dai as the grenade exploded, launching the officer several feet across the tent. Seeing it was safe, Rockwell stepped out from hiding. He began to walk to the door. Passing by, he glanced at Lieutenant Dai. The man's legs were badly scorched and torn, and he had landed face down on a pallet loaded with jade artifacts and stolen jewelry.\n\n\n\n\"Use //that// for the new China, Mingyu.\" Rockwell mumbled in passing. He then exited the tent. It was time to get out of there.\n\n\n\nStepping outside, the chaotic scene surrounded Rockwell. The first thing to catch his eye was the marker of his objective, the crate pile near him. It was missing several boxes, and many others left were cracked open, their contents of mortar shells clearly visible.\n\n\n\nHe looked to his right. From the large rectangular medical tent, easily seen halfway across the camp, came a stream of Japanese soldiers, as men were rushing onto the new battlefield. Even if the battle had started more than a minute before, there were still more emerging from the tent door. Through the gaps of the tent city, he saw the occasional soldier running through the narrow walkways. All around him, small-scale fighting between men on either sides, be it with fist, knife, or gun, choked out his viable routes of escape. The Japanese had laid a trap, and Rockwell was stuck in the center of it. The only way out seemed to be where he came, straight ahead and back into the forest.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rockwell took barely a step forward before he felt a pull from the sack of treasures slung on his back. In a moment, the doctor was yanked backwards with incredible force, falling to the ground on his posterior. He looked up to see his attacker, and there stood Private Luo. The big man\u2019s round face, usually stern and indifferent, was uncharacteristically transformed by a toothy smile.\n\n\n\n\u201c//D\u011bng y\u012bxi\u00e0, w\u01d2 l\u00e1i ji\u011bsh\u00ec y\u012bxi\u00e0//.\u201d Asked Rockwell, needing just a moment to breathe and reassess.\n\n\n\n\u201c//B\u00f9//.\u201d Simply responded the soldier, denying the doctor\u2019s request for a moment\u2019s peace. His face turning to anger, Luo raised his foot high, intending to bring it back down on Rockwell. The doctor rolled to the side, avoiding the attack, and he started to scurry off to his left. Luo\u2019s foot already on the ground, he swung it to the left as he drove it against Rockwell\u2019s right side, making the doctor wince but giving the momentum for his crawl to make some distance from his attacker.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rockwell faced the private. Luo ducked his head and charged towards the doctor in a shoulder bash. Rockwell quickly reached for his shoulder holster and drew his revolver. Before he could fire a shot, Luo collided with him at full force, knocking Rockwell backwards and sending his gun flying. \n\n\n\nBoth men thinking they\u2019d found their trump card, Luo drew the pistol from his waist, and Rockwell retrieved the Scissors of the Golden Scaly Dragons, its handles sticking out from his sack. Luo aimed the pistol at Rockwell and cocked it, but, as he did so, the doctor brought the open blade of the scissors down on the barrel of the gun. As Luo pulled the trigger, the entire length of the barrel of his weapon was sheared off, and no shot fired.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Surprised, Luo threw his destroyed weapon to the side. With uncharacteristic reflexes, he caught Rockwell\u2019s wrist as he tried to swing the golden scissors back up his abdomen, stopping himself from being cut in two. He squeezed with all his strength, his massive hands wrapping all the way around Rockwell\u2019s lower forearm. Both men stared into each other\u2019s eyes for several moments, each steeling their resolve facing down the other. Rockwell held onto the scissors for as long as possible, but Luo was far too strong, and the doctor was forced to drop his only weapon. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With the loss of the golden scissors, Rockwell was reinvigorated with survival instinct. With his free hand, he squarely punched Luo in the jaw, before getting two more good hits to the face. The guerrilla responded by using one hand to defend his head and the other to shove Rockwell away. Luo, a head taller than Rockwell and no longer filled with his typical stoicism, advanced on Rockwell. Both men exchanged blows for a short time, but Rockwell soon found himself becoming more battered and exhausted than his enemy. With the strength and reach advantage, Luo struck more often and harder, and both knew that the outcome of the fight was only a matter of time.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With Rockwell\u2019s strength running low, he quit his backpedaling and pivoted forward. He struck Luo once in the face, and once in the chest. This seemed the last straw for the man, and he pounced on Rockwell, landing on top of him in the ground. Luo began to strangle Rockwell with both hands. Rockwell tried to free his neck with all his might, but found himself low on strength. Unable to stop the stranglehold, he used one hand to punch Luo in the face, but the guerrilla refused to let go.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Things started going fuzzy. Rockwell began to think his road had come to an end here, in the forests of Hubei. With little struggle left to avoid resignment to that fate, suddenly, the sound of a deafening explosion completely enveloped him, and all that he heard was white noise. Luo collapsed on top of Rockwell, and a violent force was shot through the guerrilla that felt as if it shoved Rockwell further into the ground. Smoke began to rise from Luo\u2019s back, and the man released his stranglehold.\n\n\n\nRockwell pulled Luo's hands off his neck and took several deep breaths, desperate but happy to be alive. His stroke of luck pumping him with a new round of adrenaline, he rolled the big man's body off of him and stood up.\n\n\n\nRockwell's senses soon began to return with the airflow. Looking towards Luo, a massive burnt dent mark filled his entire upper back. Rockwell then turned towards the pile of crates. He saw a thin Japanese soldier, eyes closed and nearly doubled over. His hand was placed on an open crate of mortar shells.\n\n\n\nRockwell, his hearing returning, quickly made out what the soldier was doing. He was laughing the heartiest laugh the doctor had ever heard in all his adventures. Putting two and two together, Rockwell realized the soldier had tossed an active mortar shell squarely on Luo's back. If the guerrilla had not been such a big man, Rockwell would likely have died with him. And the enemy sergeant thought it was funniest thing. But that didn't all sink in with the doctor at once.\n\n\n\n\"//Arigat\u014d//.\" Rockwell said shakily, still catching his breath. He meant it sincerely. The soldier had saved his life.\n\n\n\nHearing the word, the Japanese man straightened up. He thought Rockwell certainly would've been killed by the blast. He delayed a moment as he stared at the doctor, unsure of what to do. Coming to his senses, he then pulled another shell from the crate, and he tossed it at Rockwell. \n\n\n\nThe light whistle of the shell spelled doom for the doctor. Thinking quickly, and still full of adrenaline, he quickly lifted up the corpse of Luo and pressed it against himself where he stood. The guerrilla was nearly too much for the doctor to hold, and he certainly couldn't do it for long, but for the moment he had he braced himself against the body to the best of his ability.\n\n\n\nAs the bomb fell short of Rockwell, Luo took the brunt of the explosion and was sent flying to the side. The doctor was pushed to the ground and back several feet, being dragged along the grass by the force of the shell. Though dazed, bruised, and cut up, Rockwell was certainly still alive, and the Japanese man was eager to finish the job.\n\n\n\nRockwell knew he needed an out, and using dead men as shields would not cut it again. The soldier was soon to throw yet another shell, and his aim might've improved the second time. Rushedly scanning his surroundings, he looked to his left, and found that he'd stopped right next to the Scissors of the Golden Scaly Dragons, which had fallen to the ground before.\n\n\n\nAs the Japanese man reached for another mortar shell, Rockwell retrieved the golden scissors and rose to his feet. He rose it over his head, and threw it directly at the enemy's head like a tomahawk. Quick to his wits, the soldier ducked, and the scissors instead were lodged behind him in an unopened crate just above his head, the box just barely placed at the edge of a lower crate in a very precarious position.\n\n\n\n\"//Naisushotto//.\" Said the Japanese, chuckling. He pulled out another shell. Though he jested, he knew he had Rockwell beat.\n\n\n\nRockwell stood still, chuckling quietly to himself. The golden scissors, lodged in the crate's side, had shifted the balance of weight. As the soldier prepared to toss another shell, the crate impaled with the scissors fell from its place. It landed on the soldier's head, its heavy contents knocking him out cold as it fell on top of him. The shell fell from his hand, and exploded only to his harm as both he and it struck the ground. \n\n\n\nRockwell, pleased with himself, grinned and walked over to the body.\n\n\n\n\"//Arigat\u014d.//\" He said, pulling the golden scissors from the crate. Placing it precariously once more in his sack, still having barely enough room as to have the handles stick out, he began to walk in the direction in which he came, finally ready to leave.\n\n\n\nRockwell moved quickly retracing his path. As he followed the route, he ducked and weaved through the cover of boxes and tents around the several fights taking place right in his way. He hid behind a crate before a Chinese man shoved his Japanese opponent down the way past Rockwell, and the doctor had a chance to scurry by without being involved in their knife fight. By passing these final two men, the only thing that was left between Rockwell and escape was the two-wheeled cart and the open hill it was placed on.\n\n\n\nComing near the cart, suddenly, Rockwell was shoved from behind, seemingly bashed with the end of a narrow object. He was pushed into the cart, landing face first but quick to flip onto his back and see his attacker.\n\n\n\nAbove him stood a glaring Japanese soldier. He was holding his gun by the barrel, having been using it as a club. The man, baring his teeth, adjusted his grip and raised the rifle to his shoulder, aiming at Rockwell. As the soldier slid the bolt forward, Rockwell rolled to the other side of the tiny cart. The soldier fired, but missed, creating a hole in the center of the shoddy cart's wooden floor, previously only covered with hay. As the ferocious man slammed another round into the chamber, Rockwell covered his face with his arms, before another shot rang out.\n\n\n\nRockwell opened his eyes and moved his arms. Blood was leaking from his attacker's head. The man fell to his right. Rockwell, still on edge, could only catch his breath for a moment as he heard a courageous war cry. Lieutenant Chen ran up to where the dead man once stood, quickly retrieving the Japanese rifle now laying on the floor. He raised it to his shoulder and took aim at Rockwell. The doctor braced for impact once again, but a crack rang out and Chen's head whipped to the left in a moment. He had been shot too, and, as he fell to the ground, he dropped the rifle at Rockwell's feet.\n\n\n\nRockwell, confused, sat up to figure out what had just happened. The lighting at the camp's edge was barely sufficient. Turning to his left, he saw men in Japanese caps crouched under a watchtower and surrounded by metal barrels for cover. They had their rifles slung over the barrels, aiming straight down the hill. They had certainly been watching for any guerrilla attempting to escape down the hill. The barrels emanated a pungent odor of oil. \n\n\n\nTo Rockwell's right, he saw men wearing peasant clothes, those he knew as Chinese guerrillas, ready with their rifles placed over a pile of crates. They must've been carrying the munitions out of the camp before the fighting had pinned them down, so they'd set up shop where they stood. The crates, certainly full of munitions and explosives, were now makeshift cover. \n\n\n\nFor a moment, the screams and gunshots filling the air seemed to cease all at once. All was quiet for a moment.\n\n\n\n//Crack//!\n\n\n\nRockwell, having set his sack of treasures aside, quickly ducked down into the cover of the cart, laying flat on his back so the short walls on either side shielded him. The singular shot was only the first of many, as the Chinese and Japanese realized the presence of the other. All hell broke loose as a storm of fire opened up just above Rockwell's head. He was stuck right in the middle of a firefight, and worse, low shots began to chip away at his cover. Once it was destroyed, there'd be no protection from the crossfire.\n\n\n\nPinned, Rockwell knew his only escape was the cart. He began pushing his body against the vehicle, banging into it with all his strength, but it wouldn't budge. Even pushing off of the ground just in front of his cover was no good. Pressure began to mount, as every lousy shot allowed either enemy to lower their aim even more. One stray round could spell the end to the doctor's adventures.\n\n\n\nLooking to see what was stopping him, Rockwell peeked his eye through the hole created by the dead Japanese attacker's rifle shot. In the dim light, he saw wooden blocks placed on each of the cart's wheels. They were the obstacles keeping it in place.\n\n\n\nIn a snap decision, Rockwell jumped up to move the blocks by hand. He only could sit up for a moment, but he was able to glance briefly at the combatants. In what he could see, both sides were assembling machine guns, be it their own or stolen. Though they were both not set up yet, the mere rifle fire forced Rockwell to snap back to his senses and lie back into cover as a bullet zipped just past his nose.\n\n\n\nRockwell knew that when those machine guns got firing, they'd tear through his flimsy fortress in mere seconds, the old wood already on its last legs. Yet, there was no way to move the blocks without facing the same fate as the two dead men at his feet. For a moment, he thought that the situation was impossible.\n\n\n\nBut Rockwell did not survive all his adventures by giving up. Scanning the area within arm's reach, only one tool was available: the rifle two men had tried to gun him down with. The firearm now laying at his feet, he carefully pulled it into his cover. Through the chips in the cart's side he saw the tops of the heads of the tallest Japanese and Chinese soldiers. Rockwell coughed several times as he began to be overpowered by the smell of oil, the bullet-ridden barrels used for cover by the Japanese leaking heavily.\n\n\n\nRockwell stopped for a moment. He knew he couldn't fight his way out, and going out in a blaze of glory seemed less than ideal. There had to be another way. \n\n\n\nThinking quickly, Rockwell found his final lifeline. He held the gun like a club and huddled up against as much cover as he could. Using all his strength, the doctor brought the butt of the rifle down on the little hole in the floor of the cart.\n\n\n\n//Crash.//\n\n\n\nThe wood gave way a little, warping downwards. Rockwell gave it another hit.\n\n\n\n//Crash.//\n\n\n\nIt broke up a little more. Rockwell, his face lit up, bashed the floor once more.\n\n\n\n//Crash!//\n\n\n\nA hole the size of the rifle\u2019s butt was opened where the little spot once was. His smirk growing, Rockwell adjusted his grip and slid the barrel of the gun through the hole. Holding the rifle from the butt, the doctor could just barely reach the blocks with the muzzle. He struggled for a moment, making several attempts to move the left block to the side properly. Peeking his head up slightly towards the Japanese, their machine gun was nearly fully assembled. The Chinese were certainly not far behind.\n\n\n\nWith a final push, he found success. The first block was out of the way, and only the right one remained. As he positioned the rifle to move the final block away, Rockwell had a realization. He'd certainly be exposed as he rolled away, and there would be no defense from the potshots of both armies. As he thought about this, both armies were placing their fully assembled Nambu machine guns on top of their cover.\n\n\n\nRockwell reached into his bag and retrieved the //Luobao Jingqian//, the Treasure Defeating Gold Coin. When thrown into the air, it could stop arrows and magic bolts. The doctor gave the coin a kiss for luck and tossed it upwards. Then, as the machine gun crews of his enemies had their fingers on the trigger, he shoved the final wooden block away with his gun, and off the cart went down the hill. The sudden jerking motion of the cart beginning its roll pulled the rifle under the hole. His hands now free, the doctor hung on to the shattered sides of his vehicle and braced himself for what could be an abrupt, violent stop.\n\n\n\nAs Rockwell began moving, several soldiers turned to fire at his cart. Unbeknownst to them, their task was impossible. The Treasure Defeating Gold Coin activated, floating and vibrating in the air. The artifact then froze every shot aimed at Rockwell, suspending their rounds in the air just past the soldiers' vision. They vibrated just like the coin, still full of their previous momentum. Unaware of the futility of their actions, crouched men fired both at Rockwell and their enemies. Indeed, even the machine gunners, entranced by handling such a powerful weapon, seemed to ignore their tracers freezing en route to their targets. Hundreds of frozen rounds filled the air in moments.\n\n\n\nAs Rockwell raced far away from the scene of the battle, the gold coin's effect ran its course, and it fell to the ground inert. Without the coin's power, all at once, every bullet suspended in the air zipped to its target at once. Hundreds of tiny powder kegs crashed into the Japanese already crumpled and leaking oil barrels on one side, and even more barraged the splintered and nearly destroyed crates of shells and munitions hoarded by the Chinese. The unintentional bomb created by the two armies could take the abuse no longer, and both the oil barrels and the munitions crates exploded at once in a spectacular fireball. The inferno, consuming the two groups of fighting men, rose into the air, signaling to all the disaster that had consumed them.\n\n\n\nFinishing his bumpy ride down a particularly rock-laden stretch of the hill, the cart quickly slowed down as the side not supported by wheels acted as brakes for the vehicle as it dug into the earth. Rockwell briefly turned to glance at the fireball he had created up the hill. He chuckled slightly, then, keeping his mind on escape, jumped up from his seat and broke into a sprint for the cover of the woods. It felt something fell out of his bag, but he had no time to look back. \n\n\n\n\u201c//Tomare//!\u201d A voice shouted from the woods. As Rockwell was just about to enter the treeline, a Japanese soldier jumped up in front of him from his hiding spot. He brandished his rifle, tipped with a shining bayonet, and with a crazed look in his eye began to run towards Rockwell. The doctor tried to avoid him, turning sharply for another spot on the treeline. But, just as he was about to escape from the field, another Japanese man, a sergeant based on the insignia on his shoulder, emerged from the brush. Rockwell had no time to react as the man bashed him in the stomach with his rifle's butt, knocking him doubled-over on his back.\n\n\n\nOn the ground, Rockwell instinctually curled up and covered his face as the soldier let loose several cruel kicks into his side, back, and head. The sergeant accompanied his abuse with twisted laughs, bordering on cackling. The doctor had only a brief time to consider fighting back, as he saw the other soldier rush over to his comrade. He raised his rifle, ready to plunge his bayonet into the man on the ground. Rockwell braced himself.\n\n\n\n\u201c//Yamete! Baka-tomo//!\u201d A gruff, authoritative voice yelled from the forest. Rockwell was relieved to see both his attackers turn away from him and towards the treeline. Both of them shouldered their weapons and stood at attention. In a few short moments, a furious man stomped over to the young soldiers and slapped each of them across the face. He began to scream at them in Japanese, letting them know just how foolish they were.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t need to call them idiots,\u201d Rockwell said with a cough, \u201cThey were just doing their jobs.\u201d The angry man, clearly an officer, looked down at Rockwell. He surprised the doctor by lightly laughing.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou speak my language.\u201d The officer stated, speaking in a strange accent, mixing the speech mannerisms of the Japanese and the South English.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd you speak mine.\u201d Rockwell responded matter-of-factly. \u201cYou went to school abroad?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOxford. Class of 1932.\u201d\n\n\n\n\"No kidding. What'd you study?\" At this, the Japanese man's face lit up slightly.\n\n\n\n\"I was a student of history, with a focus on East Asia in the late classical and early modern periods. I wrote my dissertation on the Great Unifier Oda-\"\n\n\n\n\"Nobunaga!\" Rockwell butted in. Humanizing himself with his captor would probably be the best way to avoid ending up with a bullet in the head. \"What a man! The Sengoku period was maybe the best thing I studied back at Berkeley, certainly more interesting than when we started slogging through the Tokugawa Shogunate. God, I hated that.\" The officer did his best, but could not contain a little smile.\n\n\n\n\"Really? You also studied the Far East? I can only hope you learned in class that while samurai in battle are honorable and glorious, there is also value to the unity and order in peace.\"\n\n\n\n\"I understand that. I was just a dumb college kid, is all.\" He paused for a moment. \"I have to ask, how did you get into Oxford? Your family is well off?\u201d The officer\u2019s softened expression turned sour.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat is that to you?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNothing, nothing.\u201d Rockwell internally kicked himself for that misstep. Nobody spoke for a moment, until the officer continued.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou may get up now, unless you wish to continue lying in the dirt.\u201d Rockwell rose from the ground, finally getting an eye-to-eye look at the officer. He was nearly the doctor\u2019s height, rising above most of the men they were surrounded by. His clean green khaki uniform, kept to the tee of Japanese military standards, spoke for itself his dedication to his occupation and country. His sharp features were accentuated by the dim orange glow of the massive fire raging on the top of the hill. Above all, his strong, piercing eyes projected power and authority that not even Lieutenant Dai could achieve when pointing a gun at a man. That power and authority was accentuated all the more by the half dozen Japanese soldiers emerging from the brush and standing side by side with their officer. Even if Rockwell was clearly unarmed, two of them always kept their rifle trained on the foreigner. \t\t\n\n\n\nThe officer cleared his throat and pointed at the inferno. The Japanese, victorious in the battle, had begun to deploy fire brigades to quench the flame.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is your handiwork?\u201d He asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cI played no part in any of this.\u201d The officer chuckled at Rockwell's claim.\n\n\n\n\u201cLiar.\u201d With nowhere left to go in this conversation, Rockwell fell back on his training.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am an American national. The United States and the Japanese Empire are not at a state of war. If I am harmed-\u201d The officer cut him off.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou can face serious consequences in a domestic or international court of law, or even extradition to the United States to face justice.\u201d He finished. Even as Rockwell kept a poker face, he was taken aback. How did this random officer know the immunity spiel? The Japanese man continued.\n\n\n\n\"No sir, I know the little speech you've been taught to give upon capture. Your allegiance is not with America, even if both her and your masters share the same cowardly and decadent tendencies. You are one of\u2026//them//.\" The officer spat out his final word with derision, his previously amused expression beginning to twist into a disgust his enlisted men shared. He too had finally considered the fact that, at least in his eyes, Rockwell had surrendered like a coward.\n\n\n\n\"I don't know what you're talking about.\" Rockwell feigned. The officer sighed, and continued with more frustration in his voice.\n\n\n\n\"We thought you'd come while the army was away, and we planned for an armed escort to come with you. But with those degenerates, //communists//-\" The officer spoke that word with so much hate and distrust that it was like saying it was the worst taboo, \"-? Even that we thought was below you gang of thieves. What made you think you could rob Japan of her rightful treasures under her nose?\" The officer spoke with clear restrained anger, like a father chastising his son. Rockwell exhaled deeply. It was clear the man would not be fooled.\n\n\n\n\"So the jig is up, huh?\"\n\n\n\nThe officer nodded lightly. At that, Rockwell felt a strange peace.\n\n\n\n\"I don't think we've properly been introduced. My name is Silas Rockwell, Doctor and Field Agent of the SCP Foundation.\" The officer nodded again.\n\n\n\n\"Captain Masuya Kobayashi, [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ijamea-hub Imperial Japanese Anomalous Matters Examination Agency ].\" Captain Masuya said it like he was going to accompany his statement with a salute. Speaking to a foreign dog, he, of course, restrained himself.\n\n\n\n\"IJAMEA? I'm glad to say I'm quite familiar.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh? What have you come to know about the agency? Please, speak your mind.\" Knowing that, because he hadn't been killed yet, and that he probably was wanted alive, a little bit of snark bled through his filter.\n\n\n\n\"I know you're the fanatics of the fanatics. The naval and army schools recommend only the most crazy about the empire to you.\" Captain Masuya dropped whatever was left of his cordial smile, then, raising his gloved hand, slapped Rockwell across the face. Silas took a moment before turning again to face the officer.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou asked for honesty.\u201d\n\n\n\n\"'Patriotic' is the word we look for, Dr. Rockwell. Only those with the //Yamato-damashii// of ten men have the honor to serve the Emperor's Agency.\" Neither man spoke for a moment before Rockwell continued.\n\n\n\n\"So that's why those guys barely fought back when we came in, huh? They were the most 'patriotic'? They had the most \u2018Japanese spirit?\u2019\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes. It is a shame we lost such brave men today, and an even greater one you dishonor them now, but it was necessary for victory.\" Masuya thought for a moment, then laughed mockingly. \n\n\n\n\"How did your superiors not notice such an obvious trap?\" \n\n\n\nRockwell took a moment before responding. \"They never told me much. I was just told to go find the tent with your anomalies, that a stacked box of crates would mark it, and that there would be almost no one to stop me.\"\n\n\n\n\"Your superiors didn't even tell you how they learned of classified army plans?\" Rockwell shook his head. He was told that the Japanese would be away and why, but he didn't know where the info came from. Captain Masuya snorted and spat to his side.\n\n\n\n\"Typical treacherous western dogs. Our superiors came together not long ago to discuss the movements of the emperor's army. Your leading men claimed they wanted to know such information so they could follow leads on suspected artifacts without coming into our crossfire. But this is not the first case of Foundation deceit. We spoiled them with information, where individual divisions would come and go in the recent weeks, and specifics of our camps, even which ones held our treasures. Then is when we told them the entire army you've just robbed from would be away on the attack tonight. And so we lay in wait for you, certain you would come on this night.\" Rockwell kept a brave face, but inside, he felt his heart drop. He had been the fool all along.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd you decided to stay out of the fighting by hiding in the forest?\u201d Rockwell asked with some disdain, wishing to earn back a little of his bruised pride.\n\n\n\n\u201cDo not get brazen with me. My assignment was to seize or kill fleeing enemies of Japan. I have fulfilled my orders.\u201d Masuya answered, more defensively than angrily. Rockwell waited a moment before speaking again.\n\n\n\n\"So, what happens\u00a0\u00a0now?\" Silas asked. Masuya remained firm.\n\n\n\n\"You will come with us to Tokyo, and you will tell us everything you know. That's the best you deserve-\" the captain paused for a moment, \"-thief.\"\n\n\n\nMasuya then noticed a golden glimmer maybe 20 feet behind Rockwell created by the warm glow of the flame on the hill, which was now losing the battle with the firecrews. Masuya walked over to it, his men following closely behind him. Now Rockwell turned to face back up the hill. There was no physical thing left between him and the forest, but two soldiers still kept aim at the doctor. The captain reached down and picked up the Scissors of the Golden Scaly Dragons. That must've been what Rockwell dropped from his bag.\n\n\n\n\"And it is all for this? You have become a thief, an enemy of Japan for the //Kogane no Hasami//? Was it worth it, Mr. Rockwell? What can your Foundation do with this?\"\n\n\n\n\"The //Jinjiao Jian//? I was simply following orders to take it. You know a thing or two about that.\" Masuya scowled at this remark.\n\n\n\n\"No //Chinese// name will be used for an object in the service of the empire. Come. We are returning to camp.\" The captain then turned to walk back up the hill. Several of his men also began returning up the hill, but the two still aiming their rifles at Rockwell stayed in place and motioned with their weapons for the doctor to join them.\n\n\n\n\"And my bag?\" Rockwell asked.\n\n\n\n\"Not even the lowliest servant of the emperor is below you. You will return it to its rightful place yourself.\" Masuya replied, not stopping his walk. Though a statement intended to be intimidating, it, along with the fire on the hill, suddenly gave Rockwell an idea.\n\n\n\n\"Now hold on a second, captain.\" Rockwell said. \"I think you should know this before your men go through my bag.\"\n\n\n\n\"What?\" Replied Masuya, his patience worn thin by the American. He turned to face the prisoner, sneering down his nose from his elevated stance on the hill.\n\n\n\nTaking a few steps forward, Rockwell closed a bit of the distance. Rockwell then pulled his sack to his stomach, and he briefly dug through it. He then pulled a little jade teapot, the //Wanya Hu//, out of his bag. Captain Masuya was the only one to react, the sharp daggers in his eyes becoming dull at the sight. Rockwell removed the lid of the pot.\n\n\n\n\"//Happ\u014d se-!//\" Was all Captain Masuya managed to get out before he was knocked to the ground. However, instead of firing their weapons as ordered, the soldiers, just like their commanding officer, were all knocked about and to the dirt by the mass of flaming crows unleashed by the //Wanya Hu//. Dozens of burning birds, all spewing from one opening, flew panicked into the Japanese, their caws mingling with screams of pain and desperation from their victims. The crows pecked at the men as if a finger through water, and their talons sliced at them as a knife through butter. All the while, their infernal bodies burned any man they touched. The soldiers were nearly powerless as they tried to swat away the avians with their hands and rifles.\n\n\n\nRockwell, seeing his chance, struggled to cap the //Wanya Hu//. After beating an obstructive crow's head back into the pot with the lid, he finally sealed the item's power once more. He then made a break for the woods, his would-be jailers unable to stop him. A few soldiers from the top of the hill took shots at the doctor, but no man in the IJAMEA was such a good shot. Rifle rounds kicking up dust behind him, Rockwell ducked into the treeline, out of their sight.\n\n\n\nSoldiers from the camp rushed from their old fire in order to extinguish the new one engulfing their brothers in arms. They ran down with water buckets, shovelfuls of dirt, and coats, spilling soil and water as they ran at full speed. In a short time, some reached their struggling comrades, and they swatted at the birds with shovels and coats. The crows were driven back a bit from the wounded on the ground. The bucket brigades came soon after, and dumped cool water onto the writhing soldiers. Water seemed to be the crow's undoing, and those doused in it were washed off to the side, seemingly dead. The remaining animals then flew off into the night, looking as if they lost their flaming properties as they disappeared out of sight.\n\n\n\nThe saviors of the soldiers called for stretcher bearers quickly, the wounded in critical condition. Most of the men seemed dead on the spot; Captain Masuya was still breathing, though deeply struggling each second.\n\n\n\n\"//Masuya sench\u014d//!\" An enlisted man exclaimed as he took in the sight of the captain.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nIn the dark woods, Rockwell patted the bag on his back; good, it didn't seem to be missing anything else. The //Jinjiao Jian// would have to be an acceptable loss. He still held the //Wanya Hu// for defense, but with every passing second, it seemed more and more likely the IJAMEA were not following him. He knew where the Foundation safehouse was, and it would take him a day to get there, so Rockwell decided he could walk for a bit.\n\n\n\nThe artillery ceased as the doctor walked. Even after his night's excitement, the battle between the Chinese Nationalists and the Imperial Japanese Army was just beginning. The battle cries of men were heard faintly from where Rockwell stood, certainly infantry rising from their dugouts to meet the enemy, but he had no intention to join them. His battle was over for tonight. As far as Rockwell was concerned, he had a rest and a drink in order when he returned home.\n\n\n\nAs Rockwell thought further, he realized that he may have fought his battle for the day, but, like a soldier, it would certainly not be his last. The only question was when he would next be put in the field for another adventure. \n\n\n\nHe stopped for a moment. Rockwell thought again. He decided that they could put a raise on top of that drink.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n[[=]]\n\n++* **Silas Rockwell will return in \"Silas Rockwell and the Heavenly Reflection\".**\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n-----\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a> |author=Blue Foot]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["blue-foot", "ijamea-hub", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "tale"], "title": "Silas Rockwell and the Reflection of Heaven (Prologue) - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/silas-rockwell-and-the-reflection-of-heaven-prologue", "year": 2024}, "the-broken-cargo": {"created_at": "2024-01-18T10:51:00", "creator": "Salamander724", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Salamander724", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/salamander724", "comment": "", "date": "2024-01-18T10:51:00"}, {"author": "Salamander724", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/salamander724", "comment": "Added tags: _ko, _licensebox, broken-god, international, tale.

exists.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Mekhane does not exist, and Mekhane is a consequence of purely artificial constitution.</strong><sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup></li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is a scholar who is famous in the mundane world. Being a self-proclaimed militant atheist and a high-ranking cabal of <a href=\"/saphir-centre\">a certain group of interest</a>, he said in his book that \u201cthe messiah of Christianity did not exist.\u201d<sup>[<a class=\"bibcite\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"bibcite-1-8074a\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('bibitem-1')\">1</a>]: 122</sup> After being criticized by many people, religious and non-religious, he reluctantly withdrew his remarks and revised his opinion, saying, \u201cIt is true that he existed.\u201d</p>\n<p>However, even if the proposition that the Messiah of Christianity existed is (tentatively) true, this proposition does not mean that all the mythical records describing his birth, life, and even afterlife are also true. Let's take a simple analogy. <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2776\">George Washington</a>, the first president of the United States of America, exists, but that doesn't mean that the proposition \u201cGeorge Washington accidentally cut down his cherry tree as a child, but he confidently confessed without hiding it\u201d is true.</p>\n<p>If so, in the binary choice above, even if the proposition <strong>\u201cMekhane exists\u201d</strong> is true, it does not immediately prove that \u201cthe goddess Mekhane claimed by the cults of the Broken God, and the historical descriptions written in their catechisms, are true.\"</p>\n<p>Let's move on for a moment. At least, in the mundane \u201chistory of normalcy,\u201d the development of mechanical civilization was a splendid feat of the instrumental reason of human beings and the result of Entzauberung. Information technology, symbolizing modern society, is also an extension of this mechanical civilization. With the development of natural science, \u2014 or the rediscovering of what paranormal civilizations of the past had discovered \u2014 some scholars have even compared nature to machines. However, in their argument, the metaphor of machines only meant complex regularity and sophistication, not that machines themselves were superior and transcendent to humans. As the Middle Ages ended and Modern Times dawned, through machine development, vast amounts of energy could be easily transferred from one side to the other and converted. But machines were only human-made tools and still obeyed human control. Optimists prospected that technology would develop rapidly and all mankind would be able to enjoy the benefits, while pessimists talked about rapidly developing technology \u2018suppressing human freedom,\u2019 \u2018making people one-dimensional,\u2019 and \u2018leading to rapid polarization.\u2019 However, even from these pessimists' view, the product of technological civilization is presumed to be used as a tool. They just insist that those who dominate advanced technology will use it for their self-interest and evil purposes. Finally, a view widely spread by a particular movie series: machines and artificial intelligence will soon get out of human control and become a serious threat to humanity. However, in all three viewpoints about technological advancement: optimism, pessimism, and perilism, machines are not transcendental beings, nor are they objects to be worshipped by humankind.</p>\n<p>Thus, the point is that the cults of the Broken God have a feeling of worship for the machine (considered the symbol of Entzauberung and instrumental reason), with a pre-modern way of Magisches Denken.</p>\n<p>Let's return to the previous choice: <strong>\u201cMekhane exists.\u201d</strong> \uff0f <strong>\u201cMekhane does not exist, and Mekhane is a consequence of purely artificial composition.\u201d</strong> Personally, I think the former proposition is close to true. At least, I cannot think that Mekhane is a some pataphysical anomalous narrative that popped into our world. And if Mekhane does not exist, we cannot explain the archaeological findings of the Foundation, nor can we explain the existence of their primeval World Ultra-hyper-war, and above all, why the cults exist.</p>\n<p>Based on the pieces of information from their catechisms, or the fragments of catechisms at least, seized by we Foundation,<sup>[<a class=\"bibcite\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"bibcite-4-41914a\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('bibitem-4')\">4</a>]: 23-54, 221-257, 651-703</sup> and their doctrines and dogmas obtained from their detained devotees by the enhanced interrogation, they believe that the goddess Mekhane, or \u201cWAN\u201d by Maxwellism, certainly exists, and that their faith existed literally before the mundanely known origin of the humankind, and that what is written in their scriptures is the literal truth.<sup>[<a class=\"bibcite\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"bibcite-2-3770a\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('bibitem-2')\">2</a>]: 23-26, 44-50, 53-58, 72-73</sup> Yet, by the Church to which these people belong, the scriptures themselves are different, and merely silly question remains: which scripture is true among them? If one or more of the conflicting scriptures, whether the Cogwork or Maxwellians, are false or not literal truths, it is quite possible to infer that the contents of all the scriptures of the Cults of the Broken God as a whole are not literal truths either.</p>\n<p>For example, though I agree that <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/SCP-2217\">the ruins we discovered and secured in Greece</a> are from the ancient Mekhanite civilization, there is no direct content indicating worship or adoration. Interpreting these ruins as a sign of their worship of goddess Mekhane is merely an inference based on the testimony of devotees of the churches of the Broken God. According to the Foundation's official document, in the place where it was presumed to be a temple, we found only the word \u201c<span class=\"ruby\">\u039a\u03cd\u03b8\u03b7\u03c1\u03b1<span class=\"rt\">kythera</span></span>,\u201d but there were no words \u201c<span class=\"ruby\">\u0398\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2<span class=\"rt\">The\u00f3s</span></span>\u201d<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> or \u201c<span class=\"ruby\">\u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd<span class=\"rt\">daimon</span></span>\u201d,<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup> or any other terms whose grammatical roots are them.<sup>[<a class=\"bibcite\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"bibcite-5-48114a\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('bibitem-5')\">5</a>]: 33-69</sup> It is possible that the place we have interpreted as a temple may be something far from religious practice, e.g., a manufacturing mill, a research institute, a weapon hangar-like facility, etc. I think we should also keep that possibility in mind.</p>\n<p>Think of it this way: They could build and handle machines that were awestriking, trembling, and terrible, even for someone like me with a foot in this anomalous world. <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/third-law-hub\">A certain writer</a> once said: \u201cSufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\u201d However, whether it is technology or magic, it is not so awestriking that it should be worshipped for those who can familiarize, handle, and improve it. People who live with enough nuclear weapons to wipe out all countries on Earth are afraid of nuclear war. But what they are afraid of is some crazy U.S. president's sudden nuclear war declaration or inability to repair a malfunctioning nuclear launch system, not the elements of uranium or plutonium, not the physical phenomena of nuclear fission or fusion. If we think about it from this point of view, should we really think that the ancient Mekhanite Empire had worshipped the machine as their God?</p>\n<p>What I tentatively think about these Cults of the Broken God is based on the following premises.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The ancient Mekhanite civilization existed, and this civilization collapsed because of the great war. The remnants of the collapsed Mekhanite civilization lead to the current sects and cults of the churches of the Broken God.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>The scriptures and catechisms of the churches of the Broken God did not exist in the days of the ancient Mekhanite civilization and were recorded later. And they do not contain the literal truth.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are many inferences about how religion is born. Among them, I would like to think of a totemistic perspective. Any human life is an extremely humble life compared to nonexistence. Both the life of the \u2018barbaric primitive\u2019 and the life of the \u2018most civilized modern humankind\u2019 cannot escape the tragedy of recognizing themselves as a solitary being by recognizing themselves as isolated beings from nature. The primeval people, who would have lived a humble life just like us, had animals and plants as their totems. This may sound ridiculous, but in fact, modern civilization is also a kind of totemistic worldview. The totems were created for such humble humans to heal the scar between themselves and nature. The environment faced by modern people is not a natural environment but a technological environment, where the technological civilization is full everywhere; thus, technologies become the totems for modern people. Even for the primeval Mekhanite civilization, their environment was the paratechnological environment, so it can be inferred that they were also people who lived in the worldview of technology totems.<sup>[<a class=\"bibcite\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"bibcite-6-85271a\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('bibitem-6')\">6</a>]</sup></p>\n<p>The ancient Mekhanite civilization must have had tremendous technologies. But in my opinion, the Mekhane was just a literal \u2018machine,\u2019 or 'software,' or 'technology,' and these were merely tools used by the ancient Mekhanite people, not their The\u00f3s.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-4\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')\">4</a></sup> However, even with the powerful mechanical troops, the great civilization could not stop the hordes of the Flesh, and their country eventually collapsed.</p>\n<p>In the process of their collapse, numerous scholars they admired must have been dead, factories that made various artifacts must have been demolished, and many documents and computer servers that recorded their research outcomes and history must have been destroyed. Even in the case of <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/xia-dynasty\">the Xia dynasty</a>, which existed in modern-day East Asia, their existence was anomalously erased. The only things that remained must have been the artifacts that remained few compared to their heyday, a handful of survivors, and \u2018primitive people\u2019 who might have been assimilated by some survivors of the Mekhanite civilization. Some of the Mekhanite civilization survivors may have been engineers or scientists. Still, not all of the survivors could be masters of their science, and the majority of the refugees must be laypeople of science, who only consumed the products of civilization. The refugees who were laypeople must not have known the specific principles and knowledge to operate their remaining artifacts, and it must have been the same for people in the world of normalcy outside of Mekhanite civilization. For these people, remaining artifacts must have been like legendary treasures, that could not be restored once damaged or lost. The people who owned them must have had an attitude to cherish their technologies or parts of them as \u2018regalia\u2019 or \u2018halidoms.\u2019 As this attitude continued through generations, the practice of worshipping the tools would have emerged. Consequently, only a few remaining documents and oral traditions on the history of the ancient Mekhanite civilization and crude eyewitness accounts of foreigners were mixed over time and made into scriptures. Let's assume the initial Broken God faith is a totemism. Compared to animals and plants that other ethnic groups used as their totems, the technology is visible and tangible like other totems. But at the same time, it also has invisible parts full of incomprehensible mysteries. Thus, the worshipers must have come to regard themselves as something special that distinguishes them from others.</p>\n<p>Although I use the term \u2018technological civilization\u2019 to refer to the current mundane world, it can be divisible into several periods. From the Middle Ages to Contemporary times, from an epistemological perspective on machines, four mechanical devices have appeared sequentially: the clock, the balance, the engine, and the computer. In the question of \u2018work\u2019 and \u2018energy\u2019 of machines, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The clock</span> was a symbol of mechanical and elaborate laws reaching even to the fine points, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">the balance</span> was a symbol of nature with harmonious movements created by an equilibrium of attraction and repulsion. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The engine</span> introduced a new concept of \u2018energy \u2014 the ability to work\u2019 instead of the ambiguous concept of 'force.' In addition, new phenomena such as the conversion of coal chemical energy into heat and work were considered to be studied as key elements of nature; thus, the \u2018natural philosophy\u2019 was expelled by \u2018physics.\u2019 Finally, in the era of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">computers</span> where I live now, a new perspective emerged that understands the concept of information as equally crucial as mass and energy and the real world itself as a device that processes information. Even the human brain is compared and understood as a parallel supercomputer that processes information.<sup>[<a class=\"bibcite\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"bibcite-3-30650a\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('bibitem-3')\">3</a>]</sup></p>\n<p>This story was intended to explain the history of the mundane world, but it can be applied to Mekhanites. As far as we can tell, Mekhanite civilization was an anomalous civilization, in a way, close to the \u2018perfect archetype\u2019 of human technological civilization, in which all \u201cthe clocks, the balances, the engines, and the computers\u201d were developed to extremes. Ancient Mekhanite civilization had <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/SCP-2406\">highly sophisticated automata</a>, <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/SCP-2847\">artificial intelligence that has been operated by itself for thousands of years</a>, and \u2014 even though it's my own argument \u2014 some kinda factory. The sects schismatized from the Broken God faith have these symbols of technological civilization one by one. The sects can be likened to the old ritualists following Bumaro to the clocks, the Cogwork Orthodoxy to the engines, and the Maxwellian Church to the computers.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-5\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')\">5</a></sup></p>\n<p>Bumaro, the charismatic leader of \u2018the Broken Church,\u2019 calls himself \u2018the Builder,\u2019 or at least called such by his devotees. As the Builder, his goals are to rebuild his God and restore her body, thus building a Broken God into a sophisticated totality that can move again. It is also worth considering that Bumaro's cult is the most \u201cbasic\u201d one, in the sense of not being obsessed with mechanically augmenting the body, contrary to what some people misunderstand. The Cogwork Orthodoxy believes in mass production, and their patriarchs are like the anomalous iteration of factory owners in the Industrial Revolution. They are so fascinated by the amazing power and energy of the engines and the unity of standards endlessly replicated by the machinery that they seek to standardize their own body to get closer to God. Thus, they are the admirers of the engines. Lastly, the Maxwellian Church finds its God, WAN, in the network. Unlike past technological civilizations, their God does not have a \u2018material\u2019 form. They also augment their bodies, but here, the augmentation is to turn their bodies into network devices, that is, terminals that can produce, transmit, and receive information.</p>\n<p>What does it mean that God is Broken? When they say that their God is <em>Broken</em>, the word may mean that she is physically broken and shattered and damaged, but it may also mean that she has a breakdown and does not work properly. It doesn't matter either way. The modern cults of the Broken God have capabilities that cannot be taken lightly, even for the Foundation, but as long as they express themselves that their God is Broken, they believe that their machine or software \u2014 Maxwellians insist that their God is not a physical machine, so it is very annoying to have to mention it one by one \u2014 is incomplete. That is a matter of course. Compared to what the Mekhanite civilization, a civilization with near-perfect technologies, enjoyed, they are far behind and can be seen only as having a few fragments of the shattered technologies. According to the inference above, they are also broken. Mekhanite civilization had a quaternity of clocks, balances, engines, and computers. As long as they serve only one of them as the form of God, they are broken, and they have their God broken.</p>\n<p>Among the middle of the Pacific islands, some cults worship the cargoplane. The cultists believe that if you carve a tree branch to make guns, clear forests to make a runway, and build a control tower by stacking logs, then one day, a U.S. military cargoplane will land there, and John Frum the Great brings them infinite cargo. What those cultists have seen is clearly true. Indeed, a plane landed on a runway built by the U.S. military and dumped a lot of cargo, and even some of the cargo was given to the indigenous people on the island. That is, what they observed and what their descendants remember are true. However, their interpretation has a critical error. I believe that the cults of the Broken God are the paranormal iteration of the cargo cults: believing that if they worship her, work hard to restore her, and do some rituals corresponding to building a control tower by stacking logs, then \u2018the Broken God\u2019 that has never existed will be reassembled.</p>\n<p>For now, my opinion is merely an unverified speculation. Still, if this is true, the cults of the Broken God are in stark contrast to the <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sarkicism-hub\">Sarkic cults</a>, the cultists of flesh. Even though N\u00e4lk\u00e4 cults perform the barbaric and primitive ritual of flesh, they do not worship the deities, while acknowledging their existence. Instead, they want humans (at least, Sarkic cultists) to transcend beyond the deities and become as powerful as them. Even though Sarkic cultists are twisted, they still believe in the potential for human development and strive, while those who believe in the Broken God submit themselves to sophisticated and advanced machines and claim to be devotees of what does not exist.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes-footer\">\n<div class=\"title\">Notes</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-1\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-1')\">1</a>.

Out of all the emotions to afflict the sapient races, sorrow is by far the most prevalent. Perhaps it's because there are so many things to feel sorrowful about\u2026</p>\n<p>The Scarlet King. An ineffable emptiness of unfathomable power, one that had devoured all his pawns for their power. The Gods. Incomprehensible beings of immeasurable strength, beings with weapons made in the forges of creation themself. The most powerful beings in all of existence, fighting to deter oblivion, to delay the end. There was no competition.</p>\n<p>The Scarlet King ripped through the Gods like a wet paper bag, consuming each fallen one's essence, growing stronger and stronger. And with each God consumed, so too was the God's morale consumed. Perhaps that is why the sapient species feel sorrow. Somewhere, out there, is something consuming their hope, their joy, their happiness.</p>\n<p>Sorrow. Out of all the emotions to afflict the sapient races, sorrow is by far the most prevalent. It was felt by the humans of Earth, where the grounds shattered as the sky ripped open. It was felt by the <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sandrewswann-s-proposal\" target=\"_blank\">Writers</a>, as their pages turned to ash and their realities were turned to nothing. It was felt by the <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2747\" target=\"_blank\">anti-narratives</a>, by the God's children, by everything and everyone. All beings from all corners of reality slumped over and wept with the strength of their sorrow as their worlds came crashing down around them.</p>\n<p>But the Scarlet King was one and the Gods were many. For every 5 killed, 20 took their place. And for a moment, it appeared as if the King was being overwhelmed, being driven back by the sheer numbers that faced him. For surely not even one as mighty as the Scarlet King could triumph over such power? Surely not even the Scarlet King could hope to survive. But alas, it was not to be. As the Gods had continued to charge the King, so too had the King continued to grow stronger upon their being. Until finally, the Gods were as ants to the boot that was the Scarlet King.</p>\n<p>As the Scarlet King finally finished its subsumption of the foolish Elder Gods that had challenged him, so too did a shadow of crimson settle over Creation. All hope was lost, for the Scarlet King had one. There was no one left to challenge it, for there was no one -</p>\n<p>And the Scarlet King stopped. For in this void beyond time was something new, something unexpected. For there was light, and there was truth. A God of Gods, a truth of truths. A <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/vision-at-betar\" target=\"_blank\">Creator</a>. And the Scarlet King knew hate for the first time since its inception. And Creation knew hope for the first time since the war. God had come for them. God had come to save them.</p>\n<p>And so commenced the indescribable, a battle of dualities. God vs the Devil, good vs evil, sorrow vs hope. And it was glorious. For the first time in existence, this void without time shone with the force of a thousand blazing supernovas. Creation wept and cheered in equal measure, as these two supreme beings exchanged blow after blow after blow. Neither gave ground, and neither gained it. Everything and everyone throughout Creation felt it, ubiquitous as it was.</p>\n<p>It was felt by the first <em>Homo erectus</em>, where they bowed down and prayed to obscure Gods, long since destroyed.</p>\n<p>It was felt by the space-faring ancestors of <em><a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2256\" target=\"_blank\">Cryptomorpha gigantes</a></em>, prompting them to leave their dying world for another.</p>\n<p>It was felt across all time and all space. And in this short period, every being in existence bowed down and prayed to their Creator for salvation. And they waited in fear, in anticipation of the winner of this mammoth battle. And then it was over. And the dust began to settle.</p>\n<p>Emerging from the dust was the Scarlet King. The Devil had slain God. And the Scarlet King walked, walked towards the Tree, towards the darkness after, as Creation marched right beside it. The King entered the Garden, and there it was\u2026<br/>\n-<br/>\n-<br/>\n-<br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:0.8em;\">Oblivion.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">+\u00a0Epilogue</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">-\u00a0The\u00a0Darkness\u00a0After</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Time as a concept had long since ceased to have any meaning.

Out of all the emotions to afflict the sapient races, sorrow is by far the most prevalent. Perhaps it's because there are so many things to feel sorrowful about...\n\n> \n\nThe Scarlet King. An ineffable emptiness of unfathomable power, one that had devoured all his pawns for their power. The Gods. Incomprehensible beings of immeasurable strength, beings with weapons made in the forges of creation themself. The most powerful beings in all of existence, fighting to deter oblivion, to delay the end. There was no competition.\n\n> \n\nThe Scarlet King ripped through the Gods like a wet paper bag, consuming each fallen one's essence, growing stronger and stronger. And with each God consumed, so too was the God's morale consumed. Perhaps that is why the sapient species feel sorrow. Somewhere, out there, is something consuming their hope, their joy, their happiness.\n\n> \n\nSorrow. Out of all the emotions to afflict the sapient races, sorrow is by far the most prevalent. It was felt by the humans of Earth, where the grounds shattered as the sky ripped open. It was felt by the [[[*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sandrewswann-s-proposal | Writers]]], as their pages turned to ash and their realities were turned to nothing. It was felt by the [[[*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2747 | anti-narratives]]], by the God's children, by everything and everyone. All beings from all corners of reality slumped over and wept with the strength of their sorrow as their worlds came crashing down around them. \n\n> \n\nBut the Scarlet King was one and the Gods were many. For every 5 killed, 20 took their place. And for a moment, it appeared as if the King was being overwhelmed, being driven back by the sheer numbers that faced him. For surely not even one as mighty as the Scarlet King could triumph over such power? Surely not even the Scarlet King could hope to survive. But alas, it was not to be. As the Gods had continued to charge the King, so too had the King continued to grow stronger upon their being. Until finally, the Gods were as ants to the boot that was the Scarlet King.\n\n> \n\nAs the Scarlet King finally finished its subsumption of the foolish Elder Gods that had challenged him, so too did a shadow of crimson settle over Creation. All hope was lost, for the Scarlet King had one. There was no one left to challenge it, for there was no one - \n\n> \n\nAnd the Scarlet King stopped. For in this void beyond time was something new, something unexpected. For there was light, and there was truth. A God of Gods, a truth of truths. A [[[*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/vision-at-betar | Creator]]]. And the Scarlet King knew hate for the first time since its inception. And Creation knew hope for the first time since the war. God had come for them. God had come to save them.\n\n> \n\nAnd so commenced the indescribable, a battle of dualities. God vs the Devil, good vs evil, sorrow vs hope. And it was glorious. For the first time in existence, this void without time shone with the force of a thousand blazing supernovas. Creation wept and cheered in equal measure, as these two supreme beings exchanged blow after blow after blow. Neither gave ground, and neither gained it. Everything and everyone throughout Creation felt it, ubiquitous as it was.\n\n> \n\nIt was felt by the first //Homo erectus//, where they bowed down and prayed to obscure Gods, long since destroyed.\n\n> \n\nIt was felt by the space-faring ancestors of //[[[*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2256 | Cryptomorpha gigantes]]]//, prompting them to leave their dying world for another.\n\n> \n\nIt was felt across all time and all space. And in this short period, every being in existence bowed down and prayed to their Creator for salvation. And they waited in fear, in anticipation of the winner of this mammoth battle. And then it was over. And the dust began to settle. \n\n> \n\nEmerging from the dust was the Scarlet King. The Devil had slain God. And the Scarlet King walked, walked towards the Tree, towards the darkness after, as Creation marched right beside it. The King entered the Garden, and there it was...\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n[[size 0.8em]]Oblivion.[[/size]]\n\n@@ @@ \n\n@@ @@ \n\n@@ @@ \n\n@@ @@ \n\n@@ @@ \n\n@@ @@ \n\n@@ @@ \n\n@@ @@ \n\n@@ @@ \n\n@@ @@ \n\n@@ @@ \n\n@@ @@ \n\n@@ @@ \n\n@@ @@ \n\n@@ @@ \n\n@@ @@ \n\n@@ @@ \n\n@@ @@ \n\n@@ @@ \n\n@@ @@ \n\n@@ @@ \n\n@@ @@ \n\n@@ @@ \n\n@@ @@ \n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Epilogue\" hide=\"- The Darkness After\"]]\n\nTime as a concept had long since ceased to have any meaning.

A chill rippled through the air, as painted countertops and empty booths framed the walls.</p>\n<p>The Agent stepped forwards, taking a breath to steady his racing heartbeat. His coat swished behind him - eyes fixating on the girl. Dressed in all white, shiny black hair pulled into a perfect loop at the base of her neck, dark eyes glittering and legs crossed primly. The chair across from her was already pulled out - prepared.</p>\n<p>She smiled, then gestured for him to step forwards.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for joining me. I was worried you wouldn\u2019t make it.\u201d</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>How Site Director Emerald Reynolds managed to be intimidating despite looking deeply uncomfortable, Agent N. D. Heckerman wasn\u2019t sure. Her narrowed blue eyes, sharp jawline, and blonde hair tightly bound in a swaying ponytail struck a contrast to her rigid posture and teeth biting hard onto her lips.</p>\n<p>Her office was white-walled, and sparsely decorated, with a framed diploma counting as a \u201cpersonal touch\u201d. His shoes scuffed muffled beats into the carpet, as he sat before her. If the Foundation was clinical, this silence was like a bottle of antiseptic.</p>\n<p>Finally, she spoke, voice crisp and lofty - \u201cAgent N.D Heckerman. You\u2019re here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 yes,\u201d Heckerman replied, uncertain. His hand fidgeted by his side, a nervous tic. A tell. Reynolds\u2019 eyes flicked to it - assessment hardwired in her programming. \u201cI\u2019m Site 404 Director Emerald Reynolds. I\u2019m sure your supervisors briefed you on my inquiry, though I\u2019d like to hear from you what you\u2019ve been told.\u201d With a direction to take her script, she seemed to relax a fraction.</p>\n<p>Heckerman swallowed, feeling self-conscious as he realised he was going to be the bearer of bad news. He\u2019d kept a false smile on his face, one that read of years in marketing and worse. But his hackles still rose at the information discrepancy.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo be perfectly honest Director, I believe I may have been insufficiently briefed on the case as it stands.\u201d The words floated across in a practised, smooth tone that walked the straight edge between reassuring and unnerving.</p>\n<p>His briefing had been four sentences. \u201cThe gal at Site 404 needs you for some meeting thing,\u201d had been the first one, muttered with a scoff by Agent Carlos Sierra. \u201cIt\u2019s some Site in Ohio where they drop all the fresh-faced researchers until they\u2019re useful enough to get an actual role,\u201d had been the second, a note of disdain in his voice. \u201cBut she said there\u2019s good money in it. Just show up, talk your way through, and get back in time for Friday drinks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then he\u2019d been given an address, a plane ticket to the U.S. and a mind swimming with questions that he\u2019d been given little chance to ask.</p>\n<p>But good money was a concrete idea, something that he could push against each question, a temporary answer that had him standing, jetlagged and troubled, on the steps of Site 404\u2019s early morning fog. Site 403 stood, about a half mile away, and Agent Heckerman vaguely remembered some sort of joke about this - some plan being almost as bad as the Twin Site\u2019s construction, or something like that.</p>\n<p>Now he stood in front of Site Director Emerald Reynolds, and he realised that the lowest rungs of the Foundation hierarchy still were part of the Foundation, and the Foundation was terrifying in all its forms.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, good lord,\u201d she groaned, tone impatient, and Heckerman got the impression this had happened to her before. \u201cDid they even forward you the email? Or were you just whisked here by some tired higher-up and told I\u2019d explain it all?\u201d</p>\n<p>That was an uncomfortably accurate description. Heckerman slid his grin to something sympathetic. \u201cSeems that way.\u201d Passing the blame along, deflecting from himself. Reynolds was not someone he intended to make angry.</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat,\u201d she hissed softly, then fished through her impeccably organised drawer for a file. Laying the cool manilla in front of him, she raised an eyebrow. \u201cAbout four months ago, I was contacted by someone who claimed to represent an anomalous corporation. I had Lost do their due diligence by looking into it, and I\u2019m thinking we might have a new Group Of Interest on our hands. Thankfully, our new friend seems cooperative. So we\u2019re meeting.\u201d Reynolds hit him with her frostbite look again, informing him sans words exactly what his position was in this.</p>\n<p>Heckerman raised an eyebrow, then felt his chest tighten when he lifted the folder open.</p>\n<p>Lightspeed Incorporated. He\u2019d read their name in the Fortune 500 before. It was one of those businesses that seemed less a focused brand, and more a tangle of networking and investments.</p>\n<p>He couldn\u2019t tell whether the dull note of surprise that fluttered in his chest was surprise at the fact they were involved in the anomalous - or surprise it had taken them this long. Big businesses always seemed to dip into the pot of the Foundation\u2019s world at some point. Heckerman had met with Google execs two months prior to wrestle a couple memetic codestrings out of their hands. But there was curious, and then there was insane.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d worked for insane. He\u2019d met Iris Dark.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeems a standard enough faire,\u201d he replied, painfully pleasant. \u201cWho is our client, specifically?\u201d</p>\n<p>The last tension melted from Reynolds, though she still seemed to radiate a tight, focused air. \u201cEstrella Vega. There\u2019s a news article Lost clipped for me that gives a rundown on her position.\u201d She gestured to the folder. Heckerman found it - a half-torn, half-hacked-away spread. A young woman\u2019s face was the centre of attention, shots of her from different angles. She was gorgeous, though that was just a fact. Dark curls at her shoulders, pale skin and dark silver eyes. Fur-lined coat and matching ankle boots. Old money.</p>\n<p>The article detailed the main story - a <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-death-of-marilla-vega\" target=\"_blank\">profile on the death of her mother, Marilla Vega</a>, and her inheritance. The company. A sparse bit of interview text scattered throughout, and a read-through made Heckerman sure that it\u2019d been scripted. MC&amp;D had taught him how to recognise a brand from a person. This was her brand - old money, Vega family, young CEO. A few flavour-filled labels over a pretty face.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s\u2026 sparse,\u201d he said, and Reynolds nodded. \u201cHer emails are more personal, but still annoyingly lacking in information,\u201d she said, staring at her hands. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get much help either way. Your reputation precedes you, though, so I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll figure it out as you go. You meet with her at 12:30.\u201d</p>\n<p>Agent Heckerman gave a slight inhale - that wasn\u2019t much time to prepare. Reynolds paused, then shook her head. \u201cAM. Tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 where?\u201d Heckerman said, because most of the time, when clients named a time after 10:00 at night, he was looking at shady exchanges in crowded bars and casinos. It wasn\u2019t his crowd - the more shady the setup, the more likely it was he\u2019d end up in a fight, and while he was trained well, he\u2019d brought a new suit just for this. It was far too expensive to get bloody this soon.</p>\n<p>\u201cCoffeehouse. Our insights suggest she might have bought out the place just for this,\u201d Reynolds wrinkled her nose, as if the idea of flaunting wealth so easily appalled her. \u201cI don\u2019t really\u2026\u201d she furrowed her brow, then shook her head, pulling up something and sliding it across to him. It was an email to Reynolds, which first registered as simply a wall of gibberish. Then Heckerman noted the sender - EVega98 - and realised this was his client.</p>\n<p>The first thought he had was that she\u2019d used a speech-to-text aid to write it. The tone was rambling, stream-of-consciousness bits of philosophy and distracted thoughts thrown in without discernible reason. \u201c\u2026 Good Lord,\u201d he muttered, slipping out of his training for the first time. Reynolds nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve been nursing a headache for four years, and <em>this</em>,\u201d she pointed to the screen, \u201cIs the current source.\u201d</p>\n<p>This, Heckerman thought, was the look of a woman who had seen it all. He felt a stroke of sympathy for her, mixed in with his pure fear.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s her goal in this?\u201d Heckerman asked, still unsure what to make of anything. Reynolds\u2019 lips pressed together as if this hit a nerve. \u201cUnclear. She just said she wants to\u2026 talk. But it\u2019s clear she wants something from us,\u201d Reynolds sank back in her chair, contemplative. \u201cHer influence and wealth would make it simple for her to gain most basic wants, so it\u2019s obviously something only we have.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell. What\u2019s my objective until then?\u201d He checked his wrist - 3 watches, a polished silver analogue for Ireland, a classy bronze one for the U.S. with a leather band, and a Bell &amp; Ross Red Radar Ceramic which had cost him over 4,000 dollars. The Radar had been intended as an international endeavour, which he\u2019d change to match the time zone he was occupying. But that had fallen flat, so the hands usually dangled hazily around whatever country he\u2019d been in two months ago. The time now was 7:00 in the morning.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to go with Dr. Lost and get a better picture of what Estrella Vega might want with us - by looking through what they already have done,\u201d Reynolds crossed her arms as if daring him for comments.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure I couldn\u2019t just garner that from the files, Director Reynolds?\u201d Heckerman replied smoothly. He wasn\u2019t much in the mood for working with a group of inexperienced Midwesterners. If he had questions, he could easily ring Sierra or Fuller and pick their thoughts.</p>\n<p>\u201cAny good Agent knows the value of collaboration, especially when in foreign territory,\u201d her tone was edged with a faint clipped imitation of Heckerman\u2019s own, and he realised she was mocking him.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 right,\u201d he conceded. \u201cOne last question.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes?\u201d Reynolds narrowed her eyes, impatient it seemed.</p>\n<p>Heckerman smiled. \u201cHow much am I getting paid for this endeavour?\u201d</p>\n<p>Reynolds smiled tightly, and fished a cheque book from her drawer, and slid it across the desk, to where the top one bore his name.</p>\n<p>Heckerman looked at the amount- and swore.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey told me you weren\u2019t cheap,\u201d Reynolds said, voice still tight. \u201cSo I hope this is satisfactory.\u201d</p>\n<p>Agent Heckerman looked up, swallowing and trying not to let his desire show in his features. \u201cThat will be\u2026 that is a quite reasonable amount, yes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Reynolds nodded tersely. \u201cGood.\u201d Standing, she picked a sleek black walkie-talkie off her desk and spoke quickly into the receiver. \u201cWait outside. Lost should find you soon,\u201d she pursed her lips again, tension flooding back into her frame. \u201cI have work to take care of.\u201d He then watched in complete horrified silence as she fished a redbull from under her desk, opened the grey thermos by her elbow, and poured half of the drink into what looked like coffee. She then shook it, took a long swig, and nodded at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you for your time.\u201d</p>\n<p>There wasn\u2019t really anything to say beyond that.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Dr. Lost was\u2026 well, there was no real expectation in Agent Heckerman\u2019s head for what he\u2019d encounter upon the much-foreshadowed researcher\u2019s arrival, but it wasn\u2019t this. They were a painfully thin, short, and unhappy-looking creature, with chin-length purple hair and thick-framed glasses. There was something unsteady about the way they walked, swaying slightly every fourth step. When they spoke, it was soft, nervous, hesitant. \u201cAgent N.D. Heckerman? I\u2019m Dr. Viktoralai Amity Lost. Um. I\u2019m here.\u201d They winced, driving a palm into their forehead with a ferocity that seemed like they actually aimed to hurt themself. \u201cSorry- fuck- sorry-\u201d and they dropped their sentence there, shaking their head.</p>\n<p>Heckerman had summoned up his thickest honeyed charm - Prince Charming smile, smooth tone. \u201cPleased to make your acquaintance, Doctor. Call me Ned, if you\u2019d like.\u201d A gentle formality, with an invitation to familiarity attached.</p>\n<p>Lost flushed slightly, seeming taken aback. \u201c\u2026 oh!\u201d</p>\n<p>Since then, they\u2019d fallen into a rhythm. Lost didn\u2019t work in a lab, but rather in a room with concrete floors and poor lighting, where heat barely seemed to reach. Ireland had a grand habit of keeping steady temperatures, something Heckerman had found to be a rather exclusive luxury the more he travelled.</p>\n<p>The Midwest\u2019s weather was like sharp claws.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis was our first major encounter with them,\u201d Lost said, voice so quiet it barely pierced through the heater they\u2019d plugged in. \u201cBack in 2017, we got reports in from Cleveland of anomalous activity. Um. Here. <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7218\" target=\"_blank\">It was some kind of time loop. We- we lost one of our Research team.</a>\u201d</p>\n<p>Heckerman wondered, for a moment, how that might affect a smaller Site like this one. 400 was always very close-knit, with the shared experience of anomalous ability. Could a tucked-away gem like this one have the same bonds? He decided to play it safe - genuine sympathy, without any presumption - \u201cI\u2019m very sorry for your loss.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt hurt,\u201d Lost conceded. \u201cBut\u2026 we\u2019re the Foundation. We shouldn\u2019t let it affect us.\u201d Heckerman had heard that line countless times, or some variation upon it - usually in two groups. Those who believed it, and those who wished they believed it. Lost seemed to fall to the latter.</p>\n<p>\u201cI see,\u201d he said simply.</p>\n<p>They worked through the document, the conversation having dried up for the moment. Heckerman could understand by the end why Lost felt hesitant about it - it was heavy with emotion, even when displayed on the cool yellow-on-black mainframe of the database. \u201cI take it this was before Marilla Vega\u2019s death,\u201d he observed. \u201cWhich gives us insight into the company, but little into the potential motivations of Miss Vega.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Lost nodded, grimacing. They looked up to the ceiling, studying it. Heckerman watched their face. They had yellow eyes - well, not really yellow. It was a light hazel, just faded enough that in the dim light, they glowed golden. A sharp, cat-like stare, at odds with their nervous demeanour.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you anomalous?\u201d</p>\n<p>He surprised himself by asking the question. Lost jumped, looking to him with wide eyes. \u201cI- um-\u201d</p>\n<p>Heckerman powered on. \u201cI come from a Site which focuses on training personnel with anomalous or anomalous-adjacent abilities. It would make sense for Reynolds to pair you up with me if you had similar attributes. Of course, I apologise for being presumptuous, if that\u2019s not the case-\u201d</p>\n<p>Lost waved their hands frantically. \u201cNo, no! It\u2019s alright. Yeah. Yes. I- I am.\u201d They flushed again. \u201cI\u2019m a reality anchor. The Hume levels around me- they\u2019re overly steady. Usually, reality fluctuates up and down just a bit, but when they tested me, it was basically just a line- reality benders don\u2019t work on me. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s the one thing I\u2019m useful for.\u201d</p>\n<p>The last sentence struck Heckerman with an odd discomfort - unsure whether to try and argue the issue, or just let it hang.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you registered with the APRC?\u201d he asked smoothly, deciding to not acknowledge it at all. Lost shook their head, confused, and he clarified - \u201cThe Anomalous Personnel Regulation Committee. Less prominent, but more well known at my Site. They help manage decisions regarding staff with anomalous traits - like yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 oh,\u201d they said, softly. \u201cI\u2019ll ask Novak about that later. She\u2019s the Research department head.\u201d</p>\n<p>Heckerman nodded. \u201cYou should. Perhaps I\u2019ll see you at 400 in the future.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lost shook their head wildly. \u201cNo, no. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s-\u201d they cut themself off, biting a pale lip. \u201cI\u2019m happy here. I just want to be useful.\u201d And they moved along.</p>\n<p>Lost had a knack at searching, and easily was able to pull up a half dozen tabs across a few platforms that were discussing a potential conspiracy surrounding the company.</p>\n<p>\u201cParawatch,\u201d Lost commented, clicking to one of the tabs and scrolling through. They paused, pointing to an exchange that had caught their eye.</p>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"parapost\">\n<p><span style=\"color: purple\"><strong>Flowercat066</strong></span> 8/6/2022 (Mon) 23:14:31 #38485920</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Anyone here heard anything about Lightspeed Incorporated?</p>\n<p>Aparently they\u2019re sponsoring some kind of event at my school and TBH i get shady vibes</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"parapost reply1\">\n<p><span style=\"color: green\"><strong>SirFrogsALot7</strong></span> 8/6/2022 (Mon) 23:58:17 #38485937</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Didn\u2019t the CEO die</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"parapost reply2\">\n<p><span style=\"color: red\"><strong>DukeJuke43</strong></span> 8/7/2022 (Tues) 01:05:26 #38485936</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>From Wikipedia \u2192 \u201cOn October 12th, 2021, former Lightspeed Incorporated CEO Dr. Marilla Vega died of a stroke, with the company\u2019s management passing to 23-year-old daughter Estrella Vega\u201d</p>\n<p>But wiki is also fake as shit so.</p>\n<p>Idk.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"parapost reply1\">\n<p><span style=\"color: purple\"><strong>Flowercat066</strong></span> 8/7/2022 (Tues) 1:15:06 #38485938</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Oh yeah i did some digging this is really shady</p>\n<p>The company had a minor data breach a few years back and there\u2019s this whole thing about marilla taking \u201cclients\u201d?????

Heckerman let out a breath. \u201cCan you get us something on that data leak, perhaps?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lost was already typing it in. Within about two minutes, they were combing through an archive from 2017, eyes narrowed. \u201cHere. It\u2019s a list of bookings for various clients- and client information.\u201d The names weren\u2019t anything Heckerman recognised. \u201cAre you sure these aren\u2019t simply a list of meetings with potential investors or business partners?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood point,\u201d Lost scanned the chart, saving it to an evidence document they were slowly constructing. Focused into their task, it was a bit impressive how easily their nerves and awkwardness melted away. \u201cI\u2019ll do a search of the names.\u201d They opened up a second monitor, letting Heckerman read out each name, as they vetted them first through a plain Google search, then through a Foundation engine. They frowned, staring at something in confusion.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat date was Gregory Dawson\u2019s appointment on?\u201d</p>\n<p>Heckerman checked. \u201cJune 5th.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe died June 23rd.\u201d</p>\n<p>Heckerman sucked in a breath. Lost locked eyes with him. \u201cGive me the dates of the others, this might be a thread.\u201d\u201d</p>\n<p>Sure enough - each person had a death listed within a month of their appointment. A new clue. But something caught Agent Heckerman\u2019s eye from the screen, and he paused. \u201cAre we thinking that these are anomaly-related?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Lost said. \u201cEither way, the period of time isn\u2019t consistent enough to be a calculated plan - the deaths are related, but they weren\u2019t premeditated. I don\u2019t think Marilla was holding the gun. But she had a hand in it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Heckerman nodded, considering it. \u201cA type of memetic poisoning, maybe? 7218 read as a possible memetic effect in my eyes. If that\u2019s what we think she\u2019s working with, we might have to talk with Reynold\u2019s about bringing in some measure of counter-memetic ammo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think the planetarium was memetic,\u201d Lost shot back.</p>\n<p>\u201cCognitohazardous?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPossibly,\u201d Lost shrugged. \u201cI think the best bet here is to use the meeting as an information gathering opportunity. I\u2019m not sure what stance Reynolds will take, if I\u2019m being honest. The Foundation could easily take care of Estrella if we needed to, and find some way to take down the company as well. But that\u2019s the Foundation. We don\u2019t have that kind of support - Site 404, that is. Estrella has the upper hand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe question is-\u201d Heckerman mused, leaning back. \u201cDoes Miss Vega know that?\u201d He let the silence hang, as Lost considered it.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoubtfully. If she knows enough about the Foundation\u2019s hierarchy to grasp how much influence our individual Site has, then she has more influence than we thought. And in that event, it would be enough of a security breach that I\u2019d bet we could use that to win greater backing,\u201d they proposed.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlaying the long game,\u201d Heckerman agreed. \u201cIt might work.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lost\u2019s eyes glinted gold, and for a second, the quick fingers over the keyboard, short violet hair melted away to the marble face of someone else. A someone like dark flowers in a shadowed hall.</p>\n<p>But then it was gone.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\u201cDid you see the new guy?\u201d the short, curvy frame of Dr. Sage West bustled its way into the break room, sitting down on the table with her legs crossed over the edge. Leaning over, she swiped a handful of chips from Sam \u201cLevi\u201d Leviticus\u2019 bag. The engineer made a wounded sound, batting her arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou talkin\u2019 about the tall ginger who Reynolds was meetin\u2019 with?\u201d sing-songed Adrien Hemlock, a cocky grin shining against brown skin. Pink streaked curls fell in his face. \u201cYeah. I saw him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think he\u2019s single?\u201d West asked. Levi choked, shaking their head.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe struck me as kind of shady, if I\u2019m being honest,\u201d said Ezekiah Lenora.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe work for a spy organisation,\u201d said West, shaking her head. \u201cEveryone here is shady.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReynolds stuck him with Lost,\u201d the scratchy voice of Dr. Maddie Simes cut in, tone scalding. \u201cI feel sorry for him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Levi frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s not really fair, Maddie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is about the Vega case,\u201d Lenora said, matter-of-factly. They had a cup of heated ramen balanced under their chin, strands of auburn hair dipping into the broth as they tried to copy something from a book to a notepad. It looked like an accident waiting to happen. \u201cThey make the most sense for it. I mean, would you prefer it be you, Simes?\u201d</p>\n<p>Simes bristled - and everyone remembered with a jolt exactly what nerve Ezekiah had just went for. After all, it had been Maddie who had sat on the other end for weeks. Who had heard Turnpike\u2019s last transmission, up to the last second.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat shouldn\u2019t matter,\u201d Maddie snapped, sulkily taking another sip from their coffee mug. \u201cThis is the Foundation. Not a personal trauma management program.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI disagree, actually,\u201d Levi said, frowning. They ran a tan hand through dirty blond hair. \u201cPersonal trauma <em>is</em> something important to consider when in this line of work. The whole attitude a lot of people seem to have around it - this idea that being a Foundation worker makes you immune to your experiences - it\u2019s toxic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis conversation isn\u2019t even about that,\u201d West said, brushing it off. \u201cWhat do you think Vega wants?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing good,\u201d Simes said scathingly. \u201cHonestly? I just want them to do a good deed and put a bullet through the girl\u2019s head. Sorry if that sounds cruel, but we don\u2019t need any more planetary death traps.\u201d</p>\n<p>Everyone winced at the blunt anger. Some wounds didn\u2019t heal.</p>\n<p>\u201cPleased to see that classified information is once again the topic of your breakroom gossip sessions,\u201d a new voice cut in, and the tall, imposing figure of Celeste Novak stepped in. Her bushy dark hair floated in a cloud around her head, eyes narrowed.</p>\n<p>\u201cBusted,\u201d West sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s not like the Lightspeed situation is really private anymore, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t. But I\u2019d still like to keep work talk away from lunch if possible.\u201d She grabbed her Tupperware-contained chicken from the fridge, setting up.</p>\n<p>Nodding, the room shifted, Levi piping up with a comment on the set they were working on for their theatre troupe, Adrien joined in, and business as normal returned.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Agent N.D Heckerman took a car to the meeting point. Reynolds\u2019 own car. Two more Agents - a short asian woman, and a taller man with grey hair; Agent Pepper and Agent Letter, as Heckerman had quickly been introduced - followed a distance behind in a grey van.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo use in breaking out anything heavy-duty,\u201d Reynolds had said, as she walked him to the car. \u201cUnlikely we\u2019ll need it. Better to blend in.\u201d</p>\n<p>He had to admit he was charmed by the red Toyota Corolla she drove, a small plush black cat on the dashboard. Reynolds rolled her eyes when he smiled at it. \u201cThe Site 403 Director Moira Fernsby got me that. She\u2019s been texting me pictures of golden retrievers cuddling with black cats and saying it\u2019s supposed to be us.\u201d A soft smile crossed her lips, and Heckerman appreciated how much he liked her. Not in any romantic sense, though she was beautiful, in a frosty, distant way. There was something nice about her presence, that made the silence comfortable as they rode.</p>\n<p>Lost and him had come up with a fairly good outline of what tactics might work best. And though he still couldn\u2019t really bring himself to warm to the Site, he had to admit it wasn\u2019t all bad. Lost and Reynolds were not the fresh-faced incompetents he\u2019d been prepared for.</p>\n<p>\u201cPepper and Letter will wait outside in the van,\u201d Reynolds informed him as she drove along the road. They passed a large billboard, with \u201cJESUS SAVES'' printed in large, faded letters. A wooden cross stuck out from the ground a few metres away, someone having spray painted it with red. Litter danced at the edge of tall corn stalks. Heckerman felt his eyes glass over, lulled into a trance by the predictable scenery. \u201cIf you need them, we\u2019ve given you a mini-com to put in your jacket pocket. Click the sides, and it\u2019ll send a radio signal out. Don\u2019t use it unless you need it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Heckerman nodded. The sun had started to set outside.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you mind the silence?\u201d Reynolds asked, about an hour in. \u201cI have a few CDs. The radio signals aren\u2019t that good out here.\u201d</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t really mind the silence, but the idea of seeing what Reynolds considered quality music intrigued him. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind a couple of tunes to fill the air.\u201d</p>\n<p>She snorted, probably from his formal delivery, and fished through the glove compartment until she pulled out a disc titled \u201cTime and Pocket Change\u201d - and below that, \u201cHeather Maloney\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u201cI saw her in concert when I was 19,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cIt was a small venue, but I\u2019ve been a fan ever since.\u201d</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t really know what to make of that - but as the music picked up, it made sense, in a way. The jaunty flow of sweet folk-rock, music that could easily be heard from a live musician at some roadside restaurant. If Emerald Reynolds had danced her way through a show at any point in her life - though, her rigid manner made it hard to believe she\u2019d ever danced in her life - it would be somewhere like that.</p>\n<p>Halfway through the trip, they stopped at a McDonalds, of all places, the two Agents sitting cross-legged in the open trunk window as they ploughed through a double-order of a Big Mac and fries. Reynolds ordered a salad, picking through it in disdain as they ate in the car\u2019s front seat. Heckerman wasn\u2019t used to this.</p>\n<p>The closest experience that came to mind was from the back of a limousine, the lanky figure of Iris Dark sprawled cat-like across the seat, faintly tipsy from a well stocked minibar. The blue LED strips falling across the angles of her face. Agent Heckerman wondered if she still thought about nights like that. Her life was so full that it seemed trivial to think that she\u2019d have time to remember him.</p>\n<p>But the rage on her face, the night she\u2019d realised exactly what he\u2019d done - how the Foundation had bought him up like a cheap chandelier - that anger was a lasting burn.</p>\n<p>Heckerman glanced across the seat, to Reynolds. Her face lit in the same way, but instead of electric blue, it was the golden panels of the setting sun through car windows. A spot of salad dressing on her chin. Her cheeks slightly flushed from the chill, despite the seat heaters on full blast.</p>\n<p>For a moment, things felt lopsided in his mind - like he was back in the limo, missing the car, instead of the other way around. Living in the past, yearning for the future, motion sick from nostalgia.</p>\n<p>Then it was gone.</p>\n<p>And Iris Dark was behind him, again. Time kept running, the hands of his watches all ticking steadily along. And he ran to, glued to his seat with the vertigo of it.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>The coffeehouse was small town charm slapped onto roadside appeal, the type of place that would no doubt be converted to a Tim Hortons at some point.</p>\n<p>It was dark inside, and for a second, Agent N.D Heckerman thought there\u2019d been a mistake. Then he saw the faintest flicker of a shadow from inside. And he knew all too well it was right.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d Reynolds said, eyes glinting with that frostbite-blue tone that sent shivers up his spine. She pressed the comm into his hand. The gun on one side, the comm on the other - his pockets felt like brass scales, the weight of the situation dragging him down as he approached the door.</p>\n<p>When Iris Dark had been his manager, he\u2019d learned to judge the anomalous by what made them useful, helpful. By what could be marketed, capitalised on. MC&amp;D had measured in dollars what the Foundation measured in danger. Secretly, he still tended to defer to that line of thought - considering anomalies not for what made them unusual, but what made them useful.</p>\n<p>The Foundation knew that the anomalous were useful.</p>\n<p>But they also knew the value of the ordinary.</p>\n<p>The Foundation had made Heckerman feel useful for the first time in his life. And it still felt surreal.</p>\n<p>Estrella Vega was someone who felt the weight of both - the use of the anomalous, and the use of the everyday.</p>\n<p>It was laid bare in her dark eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cSit,\u201d she spoke, voice surprisingly low and full. Heckerman did, his role kicking in as he gave her his most gracious smile. \u201cEstrella Vega, yes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she chewed the inside of her cheek, leaning back further. \u201cThat\u2019s me. You aren\u2019t Emerald, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was odd hearing her call the Director by her first name. It didn\u2019t feel disrespectful so much as just\u2026 uncanny.</p>\n<p>\u201cAgent N.D Heckerman,\u201d he supplied, tilting his head towards her.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got an accent. Where you from?\u201d she tilted her head curiously.</p>\n<p>\u201cIreland.\u201d It wasn\u2019t that hard to pick out, and he considered perhaps the offering of information would loosen her up a bit.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. I\u2019ve never been,\u201d she unconsciously twirled a strand of hair around her finger, tugging on it. \u201cI\u2019m going to go to Egypt, one day. I think. After I finish my training, and all that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTraining?\u201d Heckerman ventured, wondering if this was her informational quid pro quo - an olive branch accepted, perhaps.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she nodded. \u201cI\u2019m going to get training from the Foundation on celestial thaumaturgy. My Mum died before she could finish teaching me. I\u2019m reading the Picatrix, but I don\u2019t know much Arabic yet. I don\u2019t know if you work with an astral cult, but I really like your style. It\u2019s very intelligent, y\u2019know.\u201d Estrella rolled her neck. \u201cDo you think you can do it?\u201d</p>\n<p>It took a second to piece out what she was asking for - and when it finally made sense, he wasn\u2019t sure what to say. \u201cYou wish to\u2026 intern with us?\u201d</p>\n<p>Estrella considered it. \u201cMaybe. I wanna know more, though. I can pay money. Or information. My family was part of a group known as the Sabians, and that\u2019s magic shit. I\u2019m magic shit. You guys call it thaumaturgy. And I\u2019m probably dangerous. So it\u2019d be a mutually beneficial arrangement if someone were to let me help out.\u201d</p>\n<p>This wasn\u2019t what Heckerman was used to. He was used to bribes, to cash slipped under tables, to clean gunshots and dirty business. He was used to people who wanted the world.</p>\n<p>This wasn\u2019t a sorcerer who wanted the world. This was a girl who didn\u2019t know what she wanted.</p>\n<p>Heckerman always had known what he wanted. It\u2019s why he\u2019d made the same decision, over and over - always reaching up. Always reaching forwards.</p>\n<p>\u201cI like your watches,\u201d she said, cutting through his silence. Estrella raised a pale wrist. \u201cI\u2019ve got one too, and it\u2019s also fancy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA Van Cleef &amp; Arpels Midnight Planetarium,\u201d he said, recognising it.</p>\n<p>She nodded, pleased. \u201cNeat, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>They sat for another moment, the silence hanging thickly between them.</p>\n<p>Then Heckerman took a breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a Foundation Site where we train personnel with anomalous abilities,\u201d he wasn\u2019t sure whether he was allowed to tell her this much. But the need in her eyes - that hunger for something so simple as a purpose. He understood that more than anything.</p>\n<p>She wanted to be useful, even if Heckerman didn\u2019t understand yet what her use was.</p>\n<p>Estrella\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWould they help me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Heckerman paused. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he finally replied. Then he met her eyes, and smiled again. This time, it was genuine.</p>\n<p>This was his play, now. Cards on the table. \u201cBut I have a deal for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShoot,\u201d she prompted, tilting her chin up.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou help us find and destroy the anomalies your Mother created. And we\u2019ll help you train to regulate your abilities,\u201d his smile deepened. \u201cUnregulated power can turn sour over time. You could easily be destroyed by your own magic.\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure if this was true, but it made for a compelling argument - one he sensed Estrella wouldn\u2019t be able to call out.</p>\n<p>She studied the table, the silence stretching on forever, and for never. Time folding itself into paper cranes, all contained in that small darkened coffeehouse.</p>\n<p>And nodded.</p>\n<p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"earthworm\">\n<div class=\"first true/false\">\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/director-emerald-reynolds-guide-to-containing-reality-using/comments/show\">Director Emerald Reynolds' Guide To Containing Reality Using Tetris</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"hub yes/no\">\n<p><a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dr-vikki-lost\">ALL TALES</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"last true/false\">\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sage-west-s-guide-to-keeping-up-disappearances\">Sage West's Guide To Keeping Up Disappearances</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/the-deal-of-agent-heckerman\">The Deal of Agent Heckerman</a>\" by Dr Vikki Lost, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

A chill rippled through the air, as painted countertops and empty booths framed the walls. \n\n\n\nThe Agent stepped forwards, taking a breath to steady his racing heartbeat. His coat swished behind him - eyes fixating on the girl. Dressed in all white, shiny black hair pulled into a perfect loop at the base of her neck, dark eyes glittering and legs crossed primly. The chair across from her was already pulled out - prepared.\n\n\n\nShe smiled, then gestured for him to step forwards. \n\n\n\n\u201cThanks for joining me. I was worried you wouldn\u2019t make it.\u201d\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nHow Site Director Emerald Reynolds managed to be intimidating despite looking deeply uncomfortable, Agent N. D. Heckerman wasn\u2019t sure. Her narrowed blue eyes, sharp jawline, and blonde hair tightly bound in a swaying ponytail struck a contrast to her rigid posture and teeth biting hard onto her lips. \n\n\n\nHer office was white-walled, and sparsely decorated, with a framed diploma counting as a \u201cpersonal touch\u201d. His shoes scuffed muffled beats into the carpet, as he sat before her. If the Foundation was clinical, this silence was like a bottle of antiseptic. \n\n\n\nFinally, she spoke, voice crisp and lofty - \u201cAgent N.D Heckerman. You\u2019re here.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c... yes,\u201d Heckerman replied, uncertain. His hand fidgeted by his side, a nervous tic. A tell. Reynolds\u2019 eyes flicked to it - assessment hardwired in her programming. \u201cI\u2019m Site 404 Director Emerald Reynolds. I\u2019m sure your supervisors briefed you on my inquiry, though I\u2019d like to hear from you what you\u2019ve been told.\u201d With a direction to take her script, she seemed to relax a fraction. \n\n\n\nHeckerman swallowed, feeling self-conscious as he realised he was going to be the bearer of bad news. He\u2019d kept a false smile on his face, one that read of years in marketing and worse. But his hackles still rose at the information discrepancy. \n\n\n\n\u201cTo be perfectly honest Director, I believe I may have been insufficiently briefed on the case as it stands.\u201d The words floated across in a practised, smooth tone that walked the straight edge between reassuring and unnerving.\n\n\n\nHis briefing had been four sentences. \u201cThe gal at Site 404 needs you for some meeting thing,\u201d had been the first one, muttered with a scoff by Agent Carlos Sierra. \u201cIt\u2019s some Site in Ohio where they drop all the fresh-faced researchers until they\u2019re useful enough to get an actual role,\u201d had been the second, a note of disdain in his voice. \u201cBut she said there\u2019s good money in it. Just show up, talk your way through, and get back in time for Friday drinks.\u201d \n\n\n\nThen he\u2019d been given an address, a plane ticket to the U.S. and a mind swimming with questions that he\u2019d been given little chance to ask. \n\n\n\nBut good money was a concrete idea, something that he could push against each question, a temporary answer that had him standing, jetlagged and troubled, on the steps of Site 404\u2019s early morning fog. Site 403 stood, about a half mile away, and Agent Heckerman vaguely remembered some sort of joke about this - some plan being almost as bad as the Twin Site\u2019s construction, or something like that.\n\n\n\nNow he stood in front of Site Director Emerald Reynolds, and he realised that the lowest rungs of the Foundation hierarchy still were part of the Foundation, and the Foundation was terrifying in all its forms. \n\n\n\n\u201cOh, good lord,\u201d she groaned, tone impatient, and Heckerman got the impression this had happened to her before. \u201cDid they even forward you the email? Or were you just whisked here by some tired higher-up and told I\u2019d explain it all?\u201d \n\n\n\nThat was an uncomfortably accurate description. Heckerman slid his grin to something sympathetic. \u201cSeems that way.\u201d Passing the blame along, deflecting from himself. Reynolds was not someone he intended to make angry.\n\n\n\n\u201cGreat,\u201d she hissed softly, then fished through her impeccably organised drawer for a file. Laying the cool manilla in front of him, she raised an eyebrow. \u201cAbout four months ago, I was contacted by someone who claimed to represent an anomalous corporation. I had Lost do their due diligence by looking into it, and I\u2019m thinking we might have a new Group Of Interest on our hands. Thankfully, our new friend seems cooperative. So we\u2019re meeting.\u201d Reynolds hit him with her frostbite look again, informing him sans words exactly what his position was in this.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nHeckerman raised an eyebrow, then felt his chest tighten when he lifted the folder open.\n\n\n\nLightspeed Incorporated. He\u2019d read their name in the Fortune 500 before. It was one of those businesses that seemed less a focused brand, and more a tangle of networking and investments. \n\n\n\nHe couldn\u2019t tell whether the dull note of surprise that fluttered in his chest was surprise at the fact they were involved in the anomalous - or surprise it had taken them this long. Big businesses always seemed to dip into the pot of the Foundation\u2019s world at some point. Heckerman had met with Google execs two months prior to wrestle a couple memetic codestrings out of their hands. But there was curious, and then there was insane. \n\n\n\nHe\u2019d worked for insane. He\u2019d met Iris Dark. \n\n\n\n\u201cSeems a standard enough faire,\u201d he replied, painfully pleasant. \u201cWho is our client, specifically?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe last tension melted from Reynolds, though she still seemed to radiate a tight, focused air. \u201cEstrella Vega. There\u2019s a news article Lost clipped for me that gives a rundown on her position.\u201d She gestured to the folder. Heckerman found it - a half-torn, half-hacked-away spread. A young woman\u2019s face was the centre of attention, shots of her from different angles. She was gorgeous, though that was just a fact. Dark curls at her shoulders, pale skin and dark silver eyes. Fur-lined coat and matching ankle boots. Old money. \n\n\n\nThe article detailed the main story - a [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-death-of-marilla-vega profile on the death of her mother, Marilla Vega], and her inheritance. The company. A sparse bit of interview text scattered throughout, and a read-through made Heckerman sure that it\u2019d been scripted. MC&D had taught him how to recognise a brand from a person. This was her brand - old money, Vega family, young CEO. A few flavour-filled labels over a pretty face.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s\u2026 sparse,\u201d he said, and Reynolds nodded. \u201cHer emails are more personal, but still annoyingly lacking in information,\u201d she said, staring at her hands. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get much help either way. Your reputation precedes you, though, so I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll figure it out as you go. You meet with her at 12:30.\u201d\n\n\n\nAgent Heckerman gave a slight inhale - that wasn\u2019t much time to prepare. Reynolds paused, then shook her head. \u201cAM. Tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c... where?\u201d Heckerman said, because most of the time, when clients named a time after 10:00 at night, he was looking at shady exchanges in crowded bars and casinos. It wasn\u2019t his crowd - the more shady the setup, the more likely it was he\u2019d end up in a fight, and while he was trained well, he\u2019d brought a new suit just for this. It was far too expensive to get bloody this soon. \n\n\n\n\u201cCoffeehouse. Our insights suggest she might have bought out the place just for this,\u201d Reynolds wrinkled her nose, as if the idea of flaunting wealth so easily appalled her. \u201cI don\u2019t really\u2026\u201d she furrowed her brow, then shook her head, pulling up something and sliding it across to him. It was an email to Reynolds, which first registered as simply a wall of gibberish. Then Heckerman noted the sender - EVega98 - and realised this was his client.\n\n\n\nThe first thought he had was that she\u2019d used a speech-to-text aid to write it. The tone was rambling, stream-of-consciousness bits of philosophy and distracted thoughts thrown in without discernible reason. \u201c... Good Lord,\u201d he muttered, slipping out of his training for the first time. Reynolds nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve been nursing a headache for four years, and //this//,\u201d she pointed to the screen, \u201cIs the current source.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\nThis, Heckerman thought, was the look of a woman who had seen it all. He felt a stroke of sympathy for her, mixed in with his pure fear.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s her goal in this?\u201d Heckerman asked, still unsure what to make of anything. Reynolds\u2019 lips pressed together as if this hit a nerve. \u201cUnclear. She just said she wants to\u2026 talk. But it\u2019s clear she wants something from us,\u201d Reynolds sank back in her chair, contemplative. \u201cHer influence and wealth would make it simple for her to gain most basic wants, so it\u2019s obviously something only we have. \n\n\n\n\u201cWell. What\u2019s my objective until then?\u201d He checked his wrist - 3 watches, a polished silver analogue for Ireland, a classy bronze one for the U.S. with a leather band, and a Bell & Ross Red Radar Ceramic which had cost him over 4,000 dollars. The Radar had been intended as an international endeavour, which he\u2019d change to match the time zone he was occupying. But that had fallen flat, so the hands usually dangled hazily around whatever country he\u2019d been in two months ago. The time now was 7:00 in the morning.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to go with Dr. Lost and get a better picture of what Estrella Vega might want with us - by looking through what they already have done,\u201d Reynolds crossed her arms as if daring him for comments. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAre you sure I couldn\u2019t just garner that from the files, Director Reynolds?\u201d Heckerman replied smoothly. He wasn\u2019t much in the mood for working with a group of inexperienced Midwesterners. If he had questions, he could easily ring Sierra or Fuller and pick their thoughts. \n\n\n\n\u201cAny good Agent knows the value of collaboration, especially when in foreign territory,\u201d her tone was edged with a faint clipped imitation of Heckerman\u2019s own, and he realised she was mocking him. \n\n\n\n\u201c... right,\u201d he conceded. \u201cOne last question.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d Reynolds narrowed her eyes, impatient it seemed.\n\n\n\nHeckerman smiled. \u201cHow much am I getting paid for this endeavour?\u201d\n\n\n\nReynolds smiled tightly, and fished a cheque book from her drawer, and slid it across the desk, to where the top one bore his name.\n\n\n\nHeckerman looked at the amount- and swore.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey told me you weren\u2019t cheap,\u201d Reynolds said, voice still tight. \u201cSo I hope this is satisfactory.\u201d\n\n\n\nAgent Heckerman looked up, swallowing and trying not to let his desire show in his features. \u201cThat will be\u2026 that is a quite reasonable amount, yes.\u201d\n\n\n\nReynolds nodded tersely. \u201cGood.\u201d Standing, she picked a sleek black walkie-talkie off her desk and spoke quickly into the receiver. \u201cWait outside. Lost should find you soon,\u201d she pursed her lips again, tension flooding back into her frame. \u201cI have work to take care of.\u201d He then watched in complete horrified silence as she fished a redbull from under her desk, opened the grey thermos by her elbow, and poured half of the drink into what looked like coffee. She then shook it, took a long swig, and nodded at him.\n\n\n\n\u201cThank you for your time.\u201d \n\n\n\nThere wasn\u2019t really anything to say beyond that.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nDr. Lost was\u2026 well, there was no real expectation in Agent Heckerman\u2019s head for what he\u2019d encounter upon the much-foreshadowed researcher\u2019s arrival, but it wasn\u2019t this. They were a painfully thin, short, and unhappy-looking creature, with chin-length purple hair and thick-framed glasses. There was something unsteady about the way they walked, swaying slightly every fourth step. When they spoke, it was soft, nervous, hesitant. \u201cAgent N.D. Heckerman? I\u2019m Dr. Viktoralai Amity Lost. Um. I\u2019m here.\u201d They winced, driving a palm into their forehead with a ferocity that seemed like they actually aimed to hurt themself. \u201cSorry- fuck- sorry-\u201d and they dropped their sentence there, shaking their head.\n\n\n\nHeckerman had summoned up his thickest honeyed charm - Prince Charming smile, smooth tone. \u201cPleased to make your acquaintance, Doctor. Call me Ned, if you\u2019d like.\u201d A gentle formality, with an invitation to familiarity attached. \n\n\n\nLost flushed slightly, seeming taken aback. \u201c... oh!\u201d\n\n\n\nSince then, they\u2019d fallen into a rhythm. Lost didn\u2019t work in a lab, but rather in a room with concrete floors and poor lighting, where heat barely seemed to reach. Ireland had a grand habit of keeping steady temperatures, something Heckerman had found to be a rather exclusive luxury the more he travelled. \n\n\n\nThe Midwest\u2019s weather was like sharp claws. \n\n\n\n\u201cThis was our first major encounter with them,\u201d Lost said, voice so quiet it barely pierced through the heater they\u2019d plugged in. \u201cBack in 2017, we got reports in from Cleveland of anomalous activity. Um. Here. [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7218 It was some kind of time loop. We- we lost one of our Research team.]\u201d\n\n\n\nHeckerman wondered, for a moment, how that might affect a smaller Site like this one. 400 was always very close-knit, with the shared experience of anomalous ability. Could a tucked-away gem like this one have the same bonds? He decided to play it safe - genuine sympathy, without any presumption - \u201cI\u2019m very sorry for your loss.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt hurt,\u201d Lost conceded. \u201cBut\u2026 we\u2019re the Foundation. We shouldn\u2019t let it affect us.\u201d Heckerman had heard that line countless times, or some variation upon it - usually in two groups. Those who believed it, and those who wished they believed it. Lost seemed to fall to the latter. \n\n\n\n\u201cI see,\u201d he said simply.\n\n\n\nThey worked through the document, the conversation having dried up for the moment. Heckerman could understand by the end why Lost felt hesitant about it - it was heavy with emotion, even when displayed on the cool yellow-on-black mainframe of the database. \u201cI take it this was before Marilla Vega\u2019s death,\u201d he observed. \u201cWhich gives us insight into the company, but little into the potential motivations of Miss Vega.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Lost nodded, grimacing. They looked up to the ceiling, studying it. Heckerman watched their face. They had yellow eyes - well, not really yellow. It was a light hazel, just faded enough that in the dim light, they glowed golden. A sharp, cat-like stare, at odds with their nervous demeanour. \n\n\n\n\u201cAre you anomalous?\u201d\n\n\n\nHe surprised himself by asking the question. Lost jumped, looking to him with wide eyes. \u201cI- um-\u201d\n\n\n\nHeckerman powered on. \u201cI come from a Site which focuses on training personnel with anomalous or anomalous-adjacent abilities. It would make sense for Reynolds to pair you up with me if you had similar attributes. Of course, I apologise for being presumptuous, if that\u2019s not the case-\u201d\n\n\n\nLost waved their hands frantically. \u201cNo, no! It\u2019s alright. Yeah. Yes. I- I am.\u201d They flushed again. \u201cI\u2019m a reality anchor. The Hume levels around me- they\u2019re overly steady. Usually, reality fluctuates up and down just a bit, but when they tested me, it was basically just a line- reality benders don\u2019t work on me. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s the one thing I\u2019m useful for.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe last sentence struck Heckerman with an odd discomfort - unsure whether to try and argue the issue, or just let it hang.\n\n\n\n\u201cAre you registered with the APRC?\u201d he asked smoothly, deciding to not acknowledge it at all. Lost shook their head, confused, and he clarified - \u201cThe Anomalous Personnel Regulation Committee. Less prominent, but more well known at my Site. They help manage decisions regarding staff with anomalous traits - like yourself.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c... oh,\u201d they said, softly. \u201cI\u2019ll ask Novak about that later. She\u2019s the Research department head.\u201d\n\n\n\nHeckerman nodded. \u201cYou should. Perhaps I\u2019ll see you at 400 in the future.\u201d\n\n\n\nLost shook their head wildly. \u201cNo, no. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s-\u201d they cut themself off, biting a pale lip. \u201cI\u2019m happy here. I just want to be useful.\u201d And they moved along.\n\n\n\nLost had a knack at searching, and easily was able to pull up a half dozen tabs across a few platforms that were discussing a potential conspiracy surrounding the company.\n\n\n\n\u201cParawatch,\u201d Lost commented, clicking to one of the tabs and scrolling through. They paused, pointing to an exchange that had caught their eye.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"parapost\"]]\n\n##purple|**Flowercat066**## 8/6/2022 (Mon) 23:14:31 #38485920\n\n------\n\n\n\nAnyone here heard anything about Lightspeed Incorporated? \n\n\n\nAparently they\u2019re sponsoring some kind of event at my school and TBH i get shady vibes\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply1\"]]\n\n##green|**SirFrogsALot7**## 8/6/2022 (Mon) 23:58:17 #38485937\n\n------\n\n\n\nDidn\u2019t the CEO die \n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply2\"]]\n\n##red|**DukeJuke43**## 8/7/2022 (Tues) 01:05:26 #38485936\n\n------\n\n\n\nFrom Wikipedia \u2192 \u201cOn October 12th, 2021, former Lightspeed Incorporated CEO Dr. Marilla Vega died of a stroke, with the company\u2019s management passing to 23-year-old daughter Estrella Vega\u201d \n\n\n\nBut wiki is also fake as shit so. \n\n\n\nIdk. \n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply1\"]]\n\n##purple|**Flowercat066**## 8/7/2022 (Tues) 1:15:06 #38485938\n\n------\n\n\n\nOh yeah i did some digging this is really shady \n\n\n\nThe company had a minor data breach a few years back and there\u2019s this whole thing about marilla taking \u201cclients\u201d?????

Heckerman let out a breath. \u201cCan you get us something on that data leak, perhaps?\u201d\n\n\n\nLost was already typing it in. Within about two minutes, they were combing through an archive from 2017, eyes narrowed. \u201cHere. It\u2019s a list of bookings for various clients- and client information.\u201d The names weren\u2019t anything Heckerman recognised. \u201cAre you sure these aren\u2019t simply a list of meetings with potential investors or business partners?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cGood point,\u201d Lost scanned the chart, saving it to an evidence document they were slowly constructing. Focused into their task, it was a bit impressive how easily their nerves and awkwardness melted away. \u201cI\u2019ll do a search of the names.\u201d They opened up a second monitor, letting Heckerman read out each name, as they vetted them first through a plain Google search, then through a Foundation engine. They frowned, staring at something in confusion. \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat date was Gregory Dawson\u2019s appointment on?\u201d \n\n\n\nHeckerman checked. \u201cJune 5th.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHe died June 23rd.\u201d\n\n\n\nHeckerman sucked in a breath. Lost locked eyes with him. \u201cGive me the dates of the others, this might be a thread.\u201d\u201d \n\n\n\nSure enough - each person had a death listed within a month of their appointment. A new clue. But something caught Agent Heckerman\u2019s eye from the screen, and he paused. \u201cAre we thinking that these are anomaly-related?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cProbably,\u201d Lost said. \u201cEither way, the period of time isn\u2019t consistent enough to be a calculated plan - the deaths are related, but they weren\u2019t premeditated. I don\u2019t think Marilla was holding the gun. But she had a hand in it.\u201d\n\n\n\nHeckerman nodded, considering it. \u201cA type of memetic poisoning, maybe? 7218 read as a possible memetic effect in my eyes. If that\u2019s what we think she\u2019s working with, we might have to talk with Reynold\u2019s about bringing in some measure of counter-memetic ammo.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the planetarium was memetic,\u201d Lost shot back. \n\n\n\n\u201cCognitohazardous?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cPossibly,\u201d Lost shrugged. \u201cI think the best bet here is to use the meeting as an information gathering opportunity. I\u2019m not sure what stance Reynolds will take, if I\u2019m being honest. The Foundation could easily take care of Estrella if we needed to, and find some way to take down the company as well. But that\u2019s the Foundation. We don\u2019t have that kind of support - Site 404, that is. Estrella has the upper hand.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe question is-\u201d Heckerman mused, leaning back. \u201cDoes Miss Vega know that?\u201d He let the silence hang, as Lost considered it.\n\n\n\n\u201cDoubtfully. If she knows enough about the Foundation\u2019s hierarchy to grasp how much influence our individual Site has, then she has more influence than we thought. And in that event, it would be enough of a security breach that I\u2019d bet we could use that to win greater backing,\u201d they proposed.\n\n\n\n\u201cPlaying the long game,\u201d Heckerman agreed. \u201cIt might work.\u201d\n\n\n\nLost\u2019s eyes glinted gold, and for a second, the quick fingers over the keyboard, short violet hair melted away to the marble face of someone else. A someone like dark flowers in a shadowed hall. \n\n\n\nBut then it was gone. \n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n\u201cDid you see the new guy?\u201d the short, curvy frame of Dr. Sage West bustled its way into the break room, sitting down on the table with her legs crossed over the edge. Leaning over, she swiped a handful of chips from Sam \u201cLevi\u201d Leviticus\u2019 bag. The engineer made a wounded sound, batting her arm.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou talkin\u2019 about the tall ginger who Reynolds was meetin\u2019 with?\u201d sing-songed Adrien Hemlock, a cocky grin shining against brown skin. Pink streaked curls fell in his face. \u201cYeah. I saw him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou think he\u2019s single?\u201d West asked. Levi choked, shaking their head.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe struck me as kind of shady, if I\u2019m being honest,\u201d said Ezekiah Lenora. \n\n\n\n\u201cWe work for a spy organisation,\u201d said West, shaking her head. \u201cEveryone here is shady.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cReynolds stuck him with Lost,\u201d the scratchy voice of Dr. Maddie Simes cut in, tone scalding. \u201cI feel sorry for him.\u201d\n\n\n\nLevi frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s not really fair, Maddie.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is about the Vega case,\u201d Lenora said, matter-of-factly. They had a cup of heated ramen balanced under their chin, strands of auburn hair dipping into the broth as they tried to copy something from a book to a notepad. It looked like an accident waiting to happen. \u201cThey make the most sense for it. I mean, would you prefer it be you, Simes?\u201d\n\n\n\nSimes bristled - and everyone remembered with a jolt exactly what nerve Ezekiah had just went for. After all, it had been Maddie who had sat on the other end for weeks. Who had heard Turnpike\u2019s last transmission, up to the last second. \n\n\n\n\u201cThat shouldn\u2019t matter,\u201d Maddie snapped, sulkily taking another sip from their coffee mug. \u201cThis is the Foundation. Not a personal trauma management program.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI disagree, actually,\u201d Levi said, frowning. They ran a tan hand through dirty blond hair. \u201cPersonal trauma //is// something important to consider when in this line of work. The whole attitude a lot of people seem to have around it - this idea that being a Foundation worker makes you immune to your experiences - it\u2019s toxic.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThis conversation isn\u2019t even about that,\u201d West said, brushing it off. \u201cWhat do you think Vega wants?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNothing good,\u201d Simes said scathingly. \u201cHonestly? I just want them to do a good deed and put a bullet through the girl\u2019s head. Sorry if that sounds cruel, but we don\u2019t need any more planetary death traps.\u201d\n\n\n\nEveryone winced at the blunt anger. Some wounds didn\u2019t heal.\n\n\n\n\u201cPleased to see that classified information is once again the topic of your breakroom gossip sessions,\u201d a new voice cut in, and the tall, imposing figure of Celeste Novak stepped in. Her bushy dark hair floated in a cloud around her head, eyes narrowed. \n\n\n\n\u201cBusted,\u201d West sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s not like the Lightspeed situation is really private anymore, though.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t. But I\u2019d still like to keep work talk away from lunch if possible.\u201d She grabbed her Tupperware-contained chicken from the fridge, setting up. \n\n\n\nNodding, the room shifted, Levi piping up with a comment on the set they were working on for their theatre troupe, Adrien joined in, and business as normal returned.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nAgent N.D Heckerman took a car to the meeting point. Reynolds\u2019 own car. Two more Agents - a short asian woman, and a taller man with grey hair; Agent Pepper and Agent Letter, as Heckerman had quickly been introduced - followed a distance behind in a grey van. \n\n\n\n\u201cNo use in breaking out anything heavy-duty,\u201d Reynolds had said, as she walked him to the car. \u201cUnlikely we\u2019ll need it. Better to blend in.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe had to admit he was charmed by the red Toyota Corolla she drove, a small plush black cat on the dashboard. Reynolds rolled her eyes when he smiled at it. \u201cThe Site 403 Director Moira Fernsby got me that. She\u2019s been texting me pictures of golden retrievers cuddling with black cats and saying it\u2019s supposed to be us.\u201d A soft smile crossed her lips, and Heckerman appreciated how much he liked her. Not in any romantic sense, though she was beautiful, in a frosty, distant way. There was something nice about her presence, that made the silence comfortable as they rode.\n\n\n\nLost and him had come up with a fairly good outline of what tactics might work best. And though he still couldn\u2019t really bring himself to warm to the Site, he had to admit it wasn\u2019t all bad. Lost and Reynolds were not the fresh-faced incompetents he\u2019d been prepared for.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cPepper and Letter will wait outside in the van,\u201d Reynolds informed him as she drove along the road. They passed a large billboard, with \u201cJESUS SAVES'' printed in large, faded letters. A wooden cross stuck out from the ground a few metres away, someone having spray painted it with red. Litter danced at the edge of tall corn stalks. Heckerman felt his eyes glass over, lulled into a trance by the predictable scenery. \u201cIf you need them, we\u2019ve given you a mini-com to put in your jacket pocket. Click the sides, and it\u2019ll send a radio signal out. Don\u2019t use it unless you need it.\u201d \n\n\n\nHeckerman nodded. The sun had started to set outside. \n\n\n\n\u201cDo you mind the silence?\u201d Reynolds asked, about an hour in. \u201cI have a few CDs. The radio signals aren\u2019t that good out here.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t really mind the silence, but the idea of seeing what Reynolds considered quality music intrigued him. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind a couple of tunes to fill the air.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe snorted, probably from his formal delivery, and fished through the glove compartment until she pulled out a disc titled \u201cTime and Pocket Change\u201d - and below that, \u201cHeather Maloney\u201d. \n\n\n\n\u201cI saw her in concert when I was 19,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cIt was a small venue, but I\u2019ve been a fan ever since.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t really know what to make of that - but as the music picked up, it made sense, in a way. The jaunty flow of sweet folk-rock, music that could easily be heard from a live musician at some roadside restaurant. If Emerald Reynolds had danced her way through a show at any point in her life - though, her rigid manner made it hard to believe she\u2019d ever danced in her life - it would be somewhere like that.\n\n\n\nHalfway through the trip, they stopped at a McDonalds, of all places, the two Agents sitting cross-legged in the open trunk window as they ploughed through a double-order of a Big Mac and fries. Reynolds ordered a salad, picking through it in disdain as they ate in the car\u2019s front seat. Heckerman wasn\u2019t used to this. \n\n\n\nThe closest experience that came to mind was from the back of a limousine, the lanky figure of Iris Dark sprawled cat-like across the seat, faintly tipsy from a well stocked minibar. The blue LED strips falling across the angles of her face. Agent Heckerman wondered if she still thought about nights like that. Her life was so full that it seemed trivial to think that she\u2019d have time to remember him.\n\n\n\nBut the rage on her face, the night she\u2019d realised exactly what he\u2019d done - how the Foundation had bought him up like a cheap chandelier - that anger was a lasting burn.\n\n\n\nHeckerman glanced across the seat, to Reynolds. Her face lit in the same way, but instead of electric blue, it was the golden panels of the setting sun through car windows. A spot of salad dressing on her chin. Her cheeks slightly flushed from the chill, despite the seat heaters on full blast.\n\n\n\nFor a moment, things felt lopsided in his mind - like he was back in the limo, missing the car, instead of the other way around. Living in the past, yearning for the future, motion sick from nostalgia.\n\n\n\nThen it was gone.\n\n\n\nAnd Iris Dark was behind him, again. Time kept running, the hands of his watches all ticking steadily along. And he ran to, glued to his seat with the vertigo of it.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nThe coffeehouse was small town charm slapped onto roadside appeal, the type of place that would no doubt be converted to a Tim Hortons at some point. \n\n\n\nIt was dark inside, and for a second, Agent N.D Heckerman thought there\u2019d been a mistake. Then he saw the faintest flicker of a shadow from inside. And he knew all too well it was right.\n\n\n\n\u201cGood luck,\u201d Reynolds said, eyes glinting with that frostbite-blue tone that sent shivers up his spine. She pressed the comm into his hand. The gun on one side, the comm on the other - his pockets felt like brass scales, the weight of the situation dragging him down as he approached the door. \n\n\n\nWhen Iris Dark had been his manager, he\u2019d learned to judge the anomalous by what made them useful, helpful. By what could be marketed, capitalised on. MC&D had measured in dollars what the Foundation measured in danger. Secretly, he still tended to defer to that line of thought - considering anomalies not for what made them unusual, but what made them useful. \n\n\n\nThe Foundation knew that the anomalous were useful. \n\n\n\nBut they also knew the value of the ordinary.\n\n\n\nThe Foundation had made Heckerman feel useful for the first time in his life. And it still felt surreal.\n\n\n\nEstrella Vega was someone who felt the weight of both - the use of the anomalous, and the use of the everyday. \n\n\n\nIt was laid bare in her dark eyes.\n\n\n\n\u201cSit,\u201d she spoke, voice surprisingly low and full. Heckerman did, his role kicking in as he gave her his most gracious smile. \u201cEstrella Vega, yes?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she chewed the inside of her cheek, leaning back further. \u201cThat\u2019s me. You aren\u2019t Emerald, though.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt was odd hearing her call the Director by her first name. It didn\u2019t feel disrespectful so much as just\u2026 uncanny. \n\n\n\n\u201cAgent N.D Heckerman,\u201d he supplied, tilting his head towards her. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got an accent. Where you from?\u201d she tilted her head curiously.\n\n\n\n\u201cIreland.\u201d It wasn\u2019t that hard to pick out, and he considered perhaps the offering of information would loosen her up a bit.\n\n\n\n\u201cOh. I\u2019ve never been,\u201d she unconsciously twirled a strand of hair around her finger, tugging on it. \u201cI\u2019m going to go to Egypt, one day. I think. After I finish my training, and all that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cTraining?\u201d Heckerman ventured, wondering if this was her informational quid pro quo - an olive branch accepted, perhaps.\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she nodded. \u201cI\u2019m going to get training from the Foundation on celestial thaumaturgy. My Mum died before she could finish teaching me. I\u2019m reading the Picatrix, but I don\u2019t know much Arabic yet. I don\u2019t know if you work with an astral cult, but I really like your style. It\u2019s very intelligent, y\u2019know.\u201d Estrella rolled her neck. \u201cDo you think you can do it?\u201d\n\n\n\nIt took a second to piece out what she was asking for - and when it finally made sense, he wasn\u2019t sure what to say. \u201cYou wish to\u2026 intern with us?\u201d\n\n\n\nEstrella considered it. \u201cMaybe. I wanna know more, though. I can pay money. Or information. My family was part of a group known as the Sabians, and that\u2019s magic shit. I\u2019m magic shit. You guys call it thaumaturgy. And I\u2019m probably dangerous. So it\u2019d be a mutually beneficial arrangement if someone were to let me help out.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis wasn\u2019t what Heckerman was used to. He was used to bribes, to cash slipped under tables, to clean gunshots and dirty business. He was used to people who wanted the world.\n\n\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a sorcerer who wanted the world. This was a girl who didn\u2019t know what she wanted.\n\n\n\nHeckerman always had known what he wanted. It\u2019s why he\u2019d made the same decision, over and over - always reaching up. Always reaching forwards.\n\n\n\n\u201cI like your watches,\u201d she said, cutting through his silence. Estrella raised a pale wrist. \u201cI\u2019ve got one too, and it\u2019s also fancy.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cA Van Cleef & Arpels Midnight Planetarium,\u201d he said, recognising it.\n\n\n\nShe nodded, pleased. \u201cNeat, huh?\u201d\n\n\n\nThey sat for another moment, the silence hanging thickly between them.\n\n\n\nThen Heckerman took a breath.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a Foundation Site where we train personnel with anomalous abilities,\u201d he wasn\u2019t sure whether he was allowed to tell her this much. But the need in her eyes - that hunger for something so simple as a purpose. He understood that more than anything.\n\n\n\nShe wanted to be useful, even if Heckerman didn\u2019t understand yet what her use was.\n\n\n\nEstrella\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWould they help me?\u201d\n\n\n\nHeckerman paused. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he finally replied. Then he met her eyes, and smiled again. This time, it was genuine.\n\n\n\nThis was his play, now. Cards on the table. \u201cBut I have a deal for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cShoot,\u201d she prompted, tilting her chin up.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou help us find and destroy the anomalies your Mother created. And we\u2019ll help you train to regulate your abilities,\u201d his smile deepened. \u201cUnregulated power can turn sour over time. You could easily be destroyed by your own magic.\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure if this was true, but it made for a compelling argument - one he sensed Estrella wouldn\u2019t be able to call out.\n\n\n\nShe studied the table, the silence stretching on forever, and for never. Time folding itself into paper cranes, all contained in that small darkened coffeehouse. \n\n\n\nAnd nodded.\n\n\n\n\u201cDeal.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:earthworm\">:scp-wiki:component:earthworm</a>\n\n| first=true/false | last=true/false | hub=yes/no\n\n| previous-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/director-emerald-reynolds-guide-to-containing-reality-using/comments/show | previous-title=Director Emerald Reynolds' Guide To Containing Reality Using Tetris\n\n| next-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sage-west-s-guide-to-keeping-up-disappearances | next-title=Sage West's Guide To Keeping Up Disappearances\n\n| hub-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dr-vikki-lost | hub-title=ALL TALES\n\n]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a> |author=Dr Vikki Lost]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["the-death-of-marilla-vega", "scp-7218", "director-emerald-reynolds-guide-to-containing-reality-using/comments/show", "dr-vikki-lost", "sage-west-s-guide-to-keeping-up-disappearances", "component:license-box", "licensing-guide"], "tags": ["_licensebox", "adventure", "mystery", "spy-fiction", "tale", "the-twin-sites"], "title": "The Deal of Agent Heckerman - SCP Foundation", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-deal-of-agent-heckerman", "year": 2024}, "the-guilty-of-the-unkown-past": {"created_at": "2024-02-21T17:17:00", "creator": "RoadFires", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "RoadFires", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/roadfires", "comment": "", "date": "2024-02-21T17:17:00"}, {"author": "RoadFires", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/roadfires", "comment": "Forgot the rate code.", "date": "2024-02-21T17:20:00"}, {"author": "RoadFires", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/roadfires", "comment": "Added tags: tale.

Then, the silence of that brief time stopped, the crickets was no longer hearing it in his ears, and focused once more to see how, Dr. Sebastien struggled with his own decision of life.//\n\n\n\n\"Look, I'm your closest friend here, Sebastien.\" - //Dr. Alexei looked at Dr. Sebastien while crouching// - \"As long as I'm here, I will be with you in the worst escenario that you have brought to you life.\"- //take a stiff stop to poke the cigarrate in his mouth.// -\"You can't quit your life here, my friend, you know very well that it wasn't your fault, you can explain and tell the truth, they will always hear you.\" - //Dr. Sebastien tries to not to cry, but he breaks when Dr. Alexei touches his shoulder and hugs Dr. Alexei and cries for about a minutes straight.//\n\n\n\n//The cold winds grim down once the soft and warm air has liften, his tears cover his eyes and face, shouting and blaming him for the actions of his unknown past. He shouted at the whispears that hide in the darkness and once the voices was silent into spirits and respond, his ears went softer when the trees started to dance with the winds and while the crickets stood a beautiful melody that night, like if he was begging to have something that could hear in that final minutes. And when finally the clouds was wide open, the moon show his brightness again.//\n\n\n\n\"I\u2026 c-can\u2019t go back to the Foundation\u2026 I can\u2019t John\u2026 I\u2026 I ju-ust\"- //Saids Dr. Sebastien while he is grasping his words trought his mouth. And a soft voice of Dr. Alexei rose again to calm Dr. Sebastien of his doom.//\n\n\n\n\"We all know James, we all know\u2026\" - //Suddenly, that warm and soft sound of the dancing wind of the trees transforms into a stumble of horses, and figures of all sizes surround Dr. James Sebastien. He didn't manage to think, as he watched how Dr. John Alexei disappears in the woods, as the following winds carry his own spirit to the faraway land, when he knows that he will rest in peace.//\n\n\n\n//Dr. Sebastien heard some voices from the sides, but he didn't understand or was not conscious of the situation that he is in now facing. He stand still, he didnt listen anything while the voices of the unkown individuals say something to him. But his ear was grimmed, and try to follow the path witch walk Dr. Alexei in his way. But while doing it, he saw lighting of some of the individuals that still stand on. It was warm, the lighting was so beautiful for his ears. While he walked two steps on front and fell back when his body couldn't respond anymore. Like if his soul said that it is time to get a rest from that lighting... He can now feels how his body is sleeping in the grass. Tears came from his eyes, as he saw the great full moon above him, and the skies of that night with all the stars present, and his body, is now painting the floor with a crimson liquid.

Inhaling deep, multiple pops usher from under the covers. He struggles to right himself. Eventually he does, and manages to turn off the infuriating alarm.</p>\n<p>He prays, he stretches, he stands.</p>\n<p>Shuffling into the kitchen, he prepares a pot of coffee. Hal, his white rabbit servitor, sleeps soundly on the couch. Some nights, when a severe episode happens, Mordecai sleeps on the couch with her. It was better than sleeping in the un-decorated bedroom, alone\u2026</p>\n<p>\"Good morning Hal,\" Mordecai grumbles as he sets up the coffee machine. Hal's ear twitches, still lost in synthetic sleep.</p>\n<p>The coffee brews and warm, bitter-sweet aroma wafts throughout the apartment. Mordecai pulls out eggs and cheese from a sparsely stocked fridge. With the eggs frying, Mordecai takes a swift glance toward his personal laptop.</p>\n<p>He sighs. Working on the anomalies had inspired him. Yet, he was still too nervous to get back into writing. It felt empty, and like he was staring at concrete. Internally, he was actually staring at concrete. All five of him that is, all peeking out into the rest of Mordecai's headspace. Mostly, barren concrete and asphalt.</p>\n<p>The coffee finishes brewing, while prepping the cup, out of his eye he perceives a silhouette of a bird-person.</p>\n<p>Glancing in that direction, he only sees an empty dining room.</p>\n<p>He returns his focus to his coffee and takes a sip. With the honey and breve; lightly sweet, bitter, and creamy. In his thoughtspace, peeking out, cracks began to form on the concrete in the headspace. Something wells inside him, and compels him to walk over and open the laptop.</p>\n<p>Ignoring all chat messages, he opens a new text file, puts on music, and allows himself to be lost in his <span style=\"color: gold\">thoughtspace</span> as he types. After a few all-consuming moments, Mordecai's eggs start to burn.</p>\n<p>\"Oh shit,\" he says to himself as he jumps up to tend to his eggs. Not burnt, but definitely done. He fixes himself a plate and sits back down at his laptop.

He sighs and checks the time; 08:56. He takes a sip from his coffee mug.</p>\n<p>Empty.</p>\n<p>Cursing silently to himself, he rises and makes his way to the break room. Once there, Mordecai realises he's not alone as he watches Kr\u00f3lik fix himself a cup.</p>\n<p>Mordecai was not in the mood to socialise. He wanted to get his work done quickly, and peacefully. He wanted to be able to return home early, and continue drafting. Such compulsion he hadn't felt since before he joined the Foundation.</p>\n<p>\"Ah, Mordecai excellent work with the pollution rhino!\" Kr\u00f3lik cheers as he sips his coffee.</p>\n<p>Mordecai tries to hide his anxiety as he smiled, \"Yea, thanks,\" he pours himself a cup.</p>\n<p>\"I read you're going to be on my team soon,\" states Kr\u00f3lik in an attempt to make small talk.</p>\n<p>Mordecai nods his head in agreement and shuffles out of the break room.</p>\n<p>\"Leah was right, he isn't all too talkative,\" Kr\u00f3lik mumbles to an empty room.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2 id=\"toc2\"><span>13:13</span></h2>\n<p>After reading through SCP-6420, Mordecai understood where Leah was coming from about the thaumaturgy. He knocks on the door a few minutes early. Kr\u00f3lik opens the door and ushers Mordecai inside. Kr\u00f3lik and Leah are mid-conversation when Mordecai enters the room. He takes an empty seat by Leah.</p>\n<p>\"Mordecai, I know you're already familiar with Containment Specialist Samson, present are members of 6420's team. You know my brother Kr\u00f3lik.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yea, we had collaborated on 7710's conprocs,\" Mordecai says.</p>\n<p>\"The chemical composition is very interesting,\" Kr\u00f3lik bluntly states, still recalling Mordecai's reaction at his attempts of small talk. Keep to the point.</p>\n<p>Leah continues, \"I think you met Mackenzie one other time?\"</p>\n<p>\"I believe we met when I first was assigned to ARF-19,\" Mordecai mumbles and nods toward the rabbit humanoid.</p>\n<p>Mackenzie nods back and types on her laptop. The text-to-speech program repeats, \"We had lunch during your orientation.\"</p>\n<p>\"Nice to see you again,\" Mordecai smiles. He enjoyed their lunch. She had plenty of stories, and struck Mordecai has the sort of person to always look at the bright side of things.</p>\n<p>\"Like wise,\" the text-to-speech prompts.</p>\n<p>\"So, this meeting's purpose is to familiarize you with 6420 and the team. After the meeting, we hope to have enough time to give you a quick tour of where we keep the kits.

He thought about fishing season. When was it?</p>\n<p>His thoughts eventually drifted to the events earlier in the day. While touring the containment for SCP-6420-3, Macky had a few new stories to tell that weren't in the initial dossier.</p>\n<p>When Auxiliary Research Facility-19 first encountered SCP-6420, they tried to rehabilitate Macky instead of attempting to cure her. It was only after the removal of the uterus et al, that Macky was able to gain sapience and autonomy again. The small facility keeps a few baby spider-rabbits in containment, but acquired from the location itself. Instead of Macky.</p>\n<p>Mordecai shakes his head trying to get rid of the intrusive thoughts, \"When is the best time to fish in Lake Huron?\" he mumbles to himself. Hal snoozes on the couch, her ears perking slightly every now and then. Mordecai paces into the kitchen; the oven reads 09:42 (PM), regardless, he starts half a pot of coffee. He pulls out his phone and searches 'When is the best time to fish in Lake Huron?'</p>\n<p>The search query included a link from the state's website. \"So it depends on <em>what</em> is being fished? 'Smallmouth bass, walley' is best for July\u2026 ice fishing for yellow perch in January might make for a more interesting story\u2026\" the nutty smell of coffee fills the kitchen. Hal stirs from her sleep, and hops over to Mordecai.</p>\n<p>\"Or maybe\u2014 since the events take place around the partial solar eclipse\u2026 uh\u2026 March, April? Salmon! Salmon season lines up about right for the emergence of the Rising Eclipse!\"</p>\n<p>Hal cocks her head to the side in confusion. Standing up on her hind legs, she bobs her head toward the clock on the oven.</p>\n<p>\"I know, I know, it's getting late. I'll go to bed before two in the mornin'\u2026\"</p>\n<p>Hal settles back down and unblinkingly, peers at Mordecai.

Xe suggested we get the rabbits to keep us company during covid. We decided to name the two girls, Grace and Trinity. Their previous owners hadn't spayed them yet so I've set up a vet appointment for the 21st.</p>\n<p><strong>15/03/20</strong></p>\n<p>The state issued a \"shelter-at-home\" order and for all non-essential businesses to close. Grace and Trinity's vet appointment is canceled. I hope their previous owners' sexed them correctly. Tal re-sexed the rabbits and as far as Tal can tell, both rabbits have vulva.</p>\n<p><strong>23/03/20</strong></p>\n<p>Grace has been acting suspicious lately. She won't let either of us pick her up and she's started nesting. I remember seeing Trinity and Grace humping a few days ago, but that's typical rabbit behaviour regardless of rabbit sex.

Blank expression on his face, his mind spirals inward.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: gold\">\"OK, I think I'm gonna have to prepare for this visit,\" said Blues pinching the bridge of its snout.</span></p>\n<p>Mordecai huffs, and closes the laptop. He stands up, switches his office door sign to \"QUIET: THAUMATURGY IN PROGRESS\", and locks the door. He closes his eyes and imagines Hal. After a few breaths, Mordecai strides to his desk, opened a drawer and begins to prepare a mini-altar.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: gold\">\"Hal, I need you here Hal,\"</span> whispers Mordecai to an empty room as he sets up the thaumaturgy work space. Hal appears as Mordecai goes to his bookshelf, \"Good morning Hal, we have a problem,\" states Mordecai occupied with the books.</p>\n<p>He grabs a printed copy of the Torah, and a copy of Psalms. Thumbing through both books, he finds the passages he wants and bookmarks them.</p>\n<p>\"So to catch you up to speed Hal,\" Mordecai says as he sits down in his chair to rest for a moment, \"SCP-6420-1 is a house I'll be visiting today that seems to have been cursed, or hexed. The rabbits at this location are hostile, and have overcome the thaumaturgy of two other theologies already.\"</p>\n<p>Hal bobs her head up in down in apparent acknowledgement.</p>\n<p>\"I reckon, because both the 'Shema' used by the prior residents, and Macky's 'Hail Mary', weren't focused or even the appropriate prayers for the situation, that the prayers broke when interacting with the thaumaturgic flow of\u2014 whatever the hell this curse is,\" he takes a moment to slurp coffee.</p>\n<p>From his notes he read, \"<em>'Tal stated that the fly problem is of biblical proportion\u2026 and xe is a theologian.'</em> Tal is one of the prior residents of the house, and clearly xe were referencing the Plagues. However, since there is some heavy shenanigans at play here\u2014 I'm going to use passages specific for this uh, hex or curse,\" he continues to read his notes, \"'<em><span style=\"color: gold\">Exodus 12:13</span>, and <span style=\"color: gold\">Psalms 7:2-3</span> and <span style=\"color: gold\">91:1-4</span></em>, as basis for a protection charm.\"</p>\n<p>Hal sits upright lifting her chin. Mordecai continues, \"And this is where I need you. I need you to be our last line of defense. I'll program you into the charm,\" Hal bobs her head in agreement.</p>\n<p>Mordecai finishes his coffee, stands up and turns down the lights. Whispering under his breath, he approaches the gold colored candle and lights both it and incense. His whispers turn to chants as he opens his notebook, the printed Torah, and Psalms. He carefully copies down the needed passages in both English and Ceremonial Hebrew. He strikes out any mentions of the name of <span style=\"color: gold\">G-d</span> while copying. His intent was to <span style=\"color: gold\">burn</span> the charms after the visit.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2 id=\"toc8\"><span>15:26</span></h2>\n<p>An overcast day, white rabbits hop around the grass near the house. Mordecai and Kr\u00f3lik step out of the car.</p>\n<p>Cradling his head, Mordecai states, \"Wow, I can feel the thinness,\" he uses the car door for support, \"I was not prepared for this.\"</p>\n<p>\"What is? Are you alright?\" concerned, Kr\u00f3lik asks.</p>\n<p>\"Just, the reality here is thin. It's a bit dizzying. I'll be alright in a moment, I have to get my bearings,\" he takes a deep breath in, \"It's like being on a boat at sea.\"</p>\n<p>After a few moments pause, Mordecai centers himself and him and Kr\u00f3lik approach the house.</p>\n<p>Crossing the threshold, Mordecai shivers. Kr\u00f3lik gives Mordecai another concerned look. Mordecai shakes his head, \"I'll be alright. Show me the kitchen.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"So, you're sure y'all searched thoroughly?\" Mordecai asks as he starts to open random pantry doors and cupboards.</p>\n<p>\"Totally,\" said Kr\u00f3lik as he adjusts the neck brace he wore to avoid getting infected. Mordecai has no brace, and does not care. His \"\"\"charms\"\"\" are enough.</p>\n<p>Mordecai goes into the utility room from the kitchen and begins to root around. After several minutes of struggling and cursing, Mordecai closes his eyes and centralises his focus. In his <span style=\"color: gold\">thoughtspace</span>, him and Blues \"swapped\" points of view, <span style=\"color: gold\">Mordecai opens his eyes and sees thin, jagged strands of golden light in the dark. His eyes follow the threads to a location on the utility room floor. He blinks.</span> \"Swapping\" again, Mordecai goes to the spot and dusts off the top of a trap door.</p>\n<p>He tries lifting the latch. Rusted. He whispers, <span style=\"color: gold\">\"Break.\"</span>. The lock breaks, and he swings the trapdoor open. Out rushes a cloud of little black flies. Both investigators yell in surprise. After the cloud disperses, Mordecai checks the hiding spot. Four large, one gallon buckets sit covered in rabbit poo.</p>\n<p>\"Eureka!\" exclaims Mordecai.</p>\n<p>\"Well, I'll be\u2014 we didn't search as well as we thought.\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't blame you really, this place is creepy.\"</p>\n<p><em>Thump!</em></p>\n<p>Mordecai and Kr\u00f3lik look over their shoulders. Standing between them and the kitchen exit is a horde of rabbits.</p>\n<p>\"For the love of God, not again,\" Kr\u00f3lik motions toward his service weapon.</p>\n<p>\"No,\" snaps Mordecai, \"We got this.\"</p>\n<p>He closes his eyes, and sees Hal, <span style=\"color: gold\">\"We need you Hal.\"</span> Mordecai opens his eyes and watches as a giant Hal, three-times the size of a normal Hal, manifests in front of him and Kr\u00f3lik. Hal shimmers with ethereal silver mist. The horde of rabbits hop away in fright.</p>\n<p>\"Excellent Hal,\" states Mordecai.</p>\n<p>Hal honks loudly, and startles Kr\u00f3lik and Mordecai.</p>\n<p>\"Alright, alright, alright, I feel we've overstayed our welcome,\" Mordecai nervously says to Kr\u00f3lik.</p>\n<p>\"I have no complaints. I'll grab the buckets,\" Kr\u00f3lik says. Him and Mordecai follow Hal out of the house as she continues fending off rabbits until the trio reach the car. Mordecai scratches Hal's snout, \"Gut kinigl,\" he whispers to her, as she dissipates into mist.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2 id=\"toc9\"><span>17:34</span></h2>\n<p>\"On further analysis, 'Super Scrumptious, and Pleasant Produce' went out of business in 2019,\" types Macky into her keyboard, \"Damh\u00e1n must've worked at 'SSAPP' before they went out of business.\"</p>\n<p>\"What about this though,\" Mordecai points at the bottom of the bucket. In each bucket is a crude, squiggle in sharpie.</p>\n<p>Macky types, \"LOL I was hoping you could tell me. It looks like something you might know.\"</p>\n<p>Mordecai rubs his chin, \"Well, it sorta looks like a sigil. Maybe I can deconstruct it?\"</p>\n<p>\"Who could've put it there?\" asks Macky.</p>\n<p>\"From reading the files, I reckon Damh\u00e1n. After all, these were their buckets that they donated. Could be a runaway fertility spell, since the buckets were meant for the local gardens.\"</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2 id=\"toc10\"><span>22:56</span></h2>\n<p>Mordecai throws his keys on the counter, and shrugs off his spring jacket. Hal hops up to him in greeting.</p>\n<p>\"You did a fantastic job today sweetie,\" he bends down and pets her. She lays flat like a pancake, \"Ahhh, flat bun,\" after a few moments of cuddle time, Mordecai takes a deep breath in, \"OK Hal, we think we know how we're going to end the new piece.\"</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"document\">\n<div class=\"script\">\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size:75%;\"><br/>\nI-1-6<br/></span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"dialog\">\n<div class=\"char\">\n<p>BLUES</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"dtext\">\n<p>Taiga can destroy the item in question, thus destroying the demon's anchor or tie to the world.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"dialog\">\n<div class=\"char\">\n<p>STACCATO</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"dtext\">\n<p>That would trap her in a half-human, half-demon, form though wouldn't it?

Inhaling deep, multiple pops usher from under the covers. He struggles to right himself. Eventually he does, and manages to turn off the infuriating alarm. \n\n\n\nHe prays, he stretches, he stands. \n\n\n\nShuffling into the kitchen, he prepares a pot of coffee. Hal, his white rabbit servitor, sleeps soundly on the couch. Some nights, when a severe episode happens, Mordecai sleeps on the couch with her. It was better than sleeping in the un-decorated bedroom, alone...\n\n\n\n\"Good morning Hal,\" Mordecai grumbles as he sets up the coffee machine. Hal's ear twitches, still lost in synthetic sleep.\n\n\n\nThe coffee brews and warm, bitter-sweet aroma wafts throughout the apartment. Mordecai pulls out eggs and cheese from a sparsely stocked fridge. With the eggs frying, Mordecai takes a swift glance toward his personal laptop. \n\n\n\nHe sighs. Working on the anomalies had inspired him. Yet, he was still too nervous to get back into writing. It felt empty, and like he was staring at concrete. Internally, he was actually staring at concrete. All five of him that is, all peeking out into the rest of Mordecai's headspace. Mostly, barren concrete and asphalt.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coffee finishes brewing, while prepping the cup, out of his eye he perceives a silhouette of a bird-person.\n\n\n\nGlancing in that direction, he only sees an empty dining room.\n\n\n\nHe returns his focus to his coffee and takes a sip. With the honey and breve; lightly sweet, bitter, and creamy. In his thoughtspace, peeking out, cracks began to form on the concrete in the headspace. Something wells inside him, and compels him to walk over and open the laptop.\n\n\n\nIgnoring all chat messages, he opens a new text file, puts on music, and allows himself to be lost in his ##gold|thoughtspace## as he types. After a few all-consuming moments, Mordecai's eggs start to burn.\n\n\n\n\"Oh shit,\" he says to himself as he jumps up to tend to his eggs. Not burnt, but definitely done. He fixes himself a plate and sits back down at his laptop.

He sighs and checks the time; 08:56. He takes a sip from his coffee mug. \n\n\n\nEmpty. \n\n\n\nCursing silently to himself, he rises and makes his way to the break room. Once there, Mordecai realises he's not alone as he watches Kr\u00f3lik fix himself a cup. \n\n\n\nMordecai was not in the mood to socialise. He wanted to get his work done quickly, and peacefully. He wanted to be able to return home early, and continue drafting.

The text-to-speech program repeats, \"We had lunch during your orientation.\"\n\n\n\n\"Nice to see you again,\" Mordecai smiles. He enjoyed their lunch. She had plenty of stories, and struck Mordecai has the sort of person to always look at the bright side of things.\n\n\n\n\"Like wise,\" the text-to-speech prompts.\n\n\n\n\"So, this meeting's purpose is to familiarize you with 6420 and the team.

He had little time left; he places his phone in his back pocket and starts to get dressed.\n\n\n\n------\n\n++ 08:11\n\n\n\nLate, Mordecai enters his office, closes his door and takes a seat. Opening his emails, he reads:\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n\n++ 6420digitized_journals_1.pdf\n\n\n\n**09/03/20**\n\n\n\nToday Tal and I went to pick up the rabbits. Xe suggested we get the rabbits to keep us company during covid. We decided to name the two girls, Grace and Trinity. Their previous owners hadn't spayed them yet so I've set up a vet appointment for the 21st.\n\n\n\n**15/03/20**\n\n\n\nThe state issued a \"shelter-at-home\" order and for all non-essential businesses to close. Grace and Trinity's vet appointment is canceled. I hope their previous owners' sexed them correctly. Tal re-sexed the rabbits and as far as Tal can tell, both rabbits have vulva.\n\n\n\n**23/03/20**\n\n\n\nGrace has been acting suspicious lately. She won't let either of us pick her up and she's started nesting. I remember seeing Trinity and Grace humping a few days ago, but that's typical rabbit behaviour regardless of rabbit sex. Could this be a false pregnancy?\n\n\n\n**01/04/20**\n\n\n\nIt's not a false pregnancy. Happy April Fool's to us\u2026\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n[extraneous journal entries removed]\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n**08/06/20**\n\n\n\nGrace wrecked my office door trying to get to Trinity. The hinges are smashed and the door won't close properly. We fear another litter may be coming. We have our hands full enough. Please don't let her be pregnant.\n\n\n\n**12/06/20**\n\n\n\nTrinity has started to nest.\n\n\n\n**21/06/20**\n\n\n\nTrinity has had a litter (how did she also have a litter?) and Tal and I haven't found anyone to adopt the rabbits we have.\n\n\n\nDamh\u00e1n[[footnote]]A mutual friend of Tal and Isa in the organic gardening community.[[/footnote]] came by today with empty gallon bins for us to store our rabbit poo. Something felt off when they came over. I can't place my finger on what.\n\n\n\nWe hope we can donate this poo. It's a shame to put it to waste.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n\n++ 6420digitized_journals_2.pdf\n\n\n\n**12/07/20**\n\n\n\nWe woke up one morning to a cloud of flies in the utility room where we keep the empty bins.

We've tried keeping the rabbits sexed and apart from each other. But no matter how hard we've tried they keep multiplying. The fly problem is starting to get out of hand.\n\n\n\nTal pointed out yesterday that trees sprout from the poo in the house.\n\n\n\n**18/09/20**\n\n\n\nThe tree sprouts have grown tremendously. Tal and I have been trying to cut down them down but day after day more trees crop up. The flies have gotten so bad I feel like I'm losing my sanity. Tal stated that the fly problem is of biblical proportion\u2026 and xe is a theologian.\n\n\n\n**08/11/20**\n\n\n\nWe woke up to a loud crashing sound. The trees have taken over the house and Tal and I don't know what to do. What do we do? How did they grow that fast?? WHAT DO WE DO?\n\n\n\n**12/11/20**\n\n\n\n[written in a different hand] Isa has come down with some sort of illness. They woke up after sleeping for a day, complaining of lightheaded-ness.

Blank expression on his face, his mind spirals inward.\n\n\n\n##gold|\"OK, I think I'm gonna have to prepare for this visit,\" said Blues pinching the bridge of its snout.##\n\n\n\nMordecai huffs, and closes the laptop. He stands up, switches his office door sign to \"QUIET: THAUMATURGY IN PROGRESS\", and locks the door. He closes his eyes and imagines Hal. After a few breaths, Mordecai strides to his desk, opened a drawer and begins to prepare a mini-altar.\n\n\n\n##gold|\"Hal, I need you here Hal,\"## whispers Mordecai to an empty room as he sets up the thaumaturgy work space. Hal appears as Mordecai goes to his bookshelf, \"Good morning Hal, we have a problem,\" states Mordecai occupied with the books. \n\n\n\nHe grabs a printed copy of the Torah, and a copy of Psalms. Thumbing through both books, he finds the passages he wants and bookmarks them.\n\n\n\n\"So to catch you up to speed Hal,\" Mordecai says as he sits down in his chair to rest for a moment, \"SCP-6420-1 is a house I'll be visiting today that seems to have been cursed, or hexed. The rabbits at this location are hostile, and have overcome the thaumaturgy of two other theologies already.\"\n\n\n\nHal bobs her head up in down in apparent acknowledgement.\n\n\n\n\"I reckon, because both the 'Shema' used by the prior residents, and Macky's 'Hail Mary', weren't focused or even the appropriate prayers for the situation, that the prayers broke when interacting with the thaumaturgic flow of-- whatever the hell this curse is,\" he takes a moment to slurp coffee. \n\n\n\nFrom his notes he read, \"//'Tal stated that the fly problem is of biblical proportion\u2026 and xe is a theologian.'// Tal is one of the prior residents of the house, and clearly xe were referencing the Plagues. However, since there is some heavy shenanigans at play here-- I'm going to use passages specific for this uh, hex or curse,\" he continues to read his notes, \"'//##gold|Exodus 12:13##, and ##gold|Psalms 7:2-3## and ##gold|91:1-4##//, as basis for a protection charm.\"\n\n\n\nHal sits upright lifting her chin. Mordecai continues, \"And this is where I need you. I need you to be our last line of defense. I'll program you into the charm,\" Hal bobs her head in agreement.\n\n\n\nMordecai finishes his coffee, stands up and turns down the lights. Whispering under his breath, he approaches the gold colored candle and lights both it and incense. His whispers turn to chants as he opens his notebook, the printed Torah, and Psalms. He carefully copies down the needed passages in both English and Ceremonial Hebrew. He strikes out any mentions of the name of ##gold|G-d## while copying. His intent was to ##gold|burn## the charms after the visit.\n\n\n\n------\n\n++ 15:26\n\n\n\nAn overcast day, white rabbits hop around the grass near the house. Mordecai and Kr\u00f3lik step out of the car.\n\n\n\nCradling his head, Mordecai states, \"Wow, I can feel the thinness,\" he uses the car door for support, \"I was not prepared for this.\"\n\n\n\n\"What is? Are you alright?\" concerned, Kr\u00f3lik asks.\n\n\n\n\"Just, the reality here is thin. It's a bit dizzying. I'll be alright in a moment, I have to get my bearings,\" he takes a deep breath in, \"It's like being on a boat at sea.\"\n\n\n\nAfter a few moments pause, Mordecai centers himself and him and Kr\u00f3lik approach the house.\n\n\n\nCrossing the threshold, Mordecai shivers. Kr\u00f3lik gives Mordecai another concerned look. Mordecai shakes his head, \"I'll be alright. Show me the kitchen.\"\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n\"So, you're sure y'all searched thoroughly?\" Mordecai asks as he starts to open random pantry doors and cupboards.\n\n\n\n\"Totally,\" said Kr\u00f3lik as he adjusts the neck brace he wore to avoid getting infected. Mordecai has no brace, and does not care. His \"\"\"charms\"\"\" are enough.\n\n\n\nMordecai goes into the utility room from the kitchen and begins to root around. After several minutes of struggling and cursing, Mordecai closes his eyes and centralises his focus. In his ##gold|thoughtspace##, him and Blues \"swapped\" points of view, ##gold|Mordecai opens his eyes and sees thin, jagged strands of golden light in the dark. His eyes follow the threads to a location on the utility room floor. He blinks.## \"Swapping\" again, Mordecai goes to the spot and dusts off the top of a trap door.\n\n\n\nHe tries lifting the latch. Rusted. He whispers, ##gold|\"Break.\"##. The lock breaks, and he swings the trapdoor open. Out rushes a cloud of little black flies. Both investigators yell in surprise. After the cloud disperses, Mordecai checks the hiding spot. Four large, one gallon buckets sit covered in rabbit poo.\n\n\n\n\"Eureka!\" exclaims Mordecai.\n\n\n\n\"Well, I'll be-- we didn't search as well as we thought.\"\n\n\n\n\"I don't blame you really, this place is creepy.\"\n\n\n\n//Thump!//\n\n\n\nMordecai and Kr\u00f3lik look over their shoulders. Standing between them and the kitchen exit is a horde of rabbits.\n\n\n\n\"For the love of God, not again,\" Kr\u00f3lik motions toward his service weapon.\n\n\n\n\"No,\" snaps Mordecai, \"We got this.\"\n\n\n\nHe closes his eyes, and sees Hal, ##gold|\"We need you Hal.\"## Mordecai opens his eyes and watches as a giant Hal, three-times the size of a normal Hal, manifests in front of him and Kr\u00f3lik. Hal shimmers with ethereal silver mist. The horde of rabbits hop away in fright.\n\n\n\n\"Excellent Hal,\" states Mordecai.\n\n\n\nHal honks loudly, and startles Kr\u00f3lik and Mordecai.\n\n\n\n\"Alright, alright, alright, I feel we've overstayed our welcome,\" Mordecai nervously says to Kr\u00f3lik.\n\n\n\n\"I have no complaints. I'll grab the buckets,\" Kr\u00f3lik says. Him and Mordecai follow Hal out of the house as she continues fending off rabbits until the trio reach the car. Mordecai scratches Hal's snout, \"Gut kinigl,\" he whispers to her, as she dissipates into mist.\n\n\n\n------\n\n++ 17:34\n\n\n\n\"On further analysis, 'Super Scrumptious, and Pleasant Produce' went out of business in 2019,\" types Macky into her keyboard, \"Damh\u00e1n must've worked at 'SSAPP' before they went out of business.\"\n\n\n\n\"What about this though,\" Mordecai points at the bottom of the bucket. In each bucket is a crude, squiggle in sharpie.\n\n\n\nMacky types, \"LOL I was hoping you could tell me. It looks like something you might know.\"\n\n\n\nMordecai rubs his chin, \"Well, it sorta looks like a sigil. Maybe I can deconstruct it?\"\n\n\n\n\"Who could've put it there?\" asks Macky.\n\n\n\n\"From reading the files, I reckon Damh\u00e1n. After all, these were their buckets that they donated. Could be a runaway fertility spell, since the buckets were meant for the local gardens.\"\n\n\n\n------\n\n++ 22:56\n\n\n\nMordecai throws his keys on the counter, and shrugs off his spring jacket. Hal hops up to him in greeting.\n\n\n\n\"You did a fantastic job today sweetie,\" he bends down and pets her. She lays flat like a pancake, \"Ahhh, flat bun,\" after a few moments of cuddle time, Mordecai takes a deep breath in, \"OK Hal, we think we know how we're going to end the new piece.\"\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"script\"]]\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n[[size 75%]]\n\nI-1-6\n\n[[/size]]\n\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"dialog\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"char\"]]\n\nBLUES\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"dtext\"]]\n\nTaiga can destroy the item in question, thus destroying the demon's anchor or tie to the world.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"dialog\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"char\"]]\n\nSTACCATO\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"dtext\"]]\n\nThat would trap her in a half-human, half-demon, form though wouldn't it?

Sandalwood, spices, jewels; silk to compete with the Il-khan's own wares, gems unique to the Khaghan's realms. It was from that port that the Blue Princess herself sailed, to marry a king who'd been dead for a year.</p>\n<p>I remember Zaiton, city of my birth. I remember its gardens; I remember fleets of a hundred junks, their battened sails flicking like fans over carved and painted woods. But I do not remember much else. I wonder, sometimes, if I remember any of it.</p>\n<p>This came about in the seven hundredth and ninety-seventh year of my travail, as I skirted Hy-Brasil again. I saw a formation of three rocks, lichen-soaked and sea-sprayed, and remembered the Luoyang Bridge, that solid and ancient stone of the northern Song, and remembered where I came from. I remembered its name as Zaiton. But its name is not Zaiton, a western name given it by Polo, Ibn Battuta and others. Its name is Quanzhou.</p>\n<p>When was I born? I searched my memories in vain. I found those from China; then those from India and Iran; further still, those from Africa, England, Utopia, Prester John, the Island of Tomorrow, the Patchwork Archipelago. And now, the more I think of them, the less certain I am. Where did they come from? Which souls did I draw them away from?</p>\n<p>But through all these questions, some core of me still existed; some part of me remained an I, a fixed point, a first-person-pronoun. I stared upon those rocks and felt, dimly, that something had gone wrong.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>I - the central I - was born in Quanzhou in the Christian year 1266. I was the fifth child of a wealthy family; my father had done well under the old dynasty, rising to high office. But then the Mongols came, and suddenly the south Chinese were at the bottom of the imperial hierarchy. So my father retired to Quanzhou and began to build a fleet of merchant ships.</p>\n<p>With those ships, he took advantage of the new links with the West which the era had ushered in. He became known as an exporter of cinnamon, using links with Muslim merchants to become even wealthier in private life. His new wife bore him three more children, in addition to the four sons from his youth; I was the first, my brother the second.</p>\n<p>My brother would snivel around behind me while I stood behind pillars, peeping out at conversations and meetings. My father was a stern man; my feet were bound, my body and mind prepared for my future, a rote and sterile world.</p>\n<p>I wish I could say I was bold, adventurous.

Sandalwood, spices, jewels; silk to compete with the Il-khan's own wares, gems unique to the Khaghan's realms. It was from that port that the Blue Princess herself sailed, to marry a king who'd been dead for a year.\n\n\n\nI remember Zaiton, city of my birth. I remember its gardens; I remember fleets of a hundred junks, their battened sails flicking like fans over carved and painted woods. But I do not remember much else. I wonder, sometimes, if I remember any of it.\n\n\n\nThis came about in the seven hundredth and ninety-seventh year of my travail, as I skirted Hy-Brasil again. I saw a formation of three rocks, lichen-soaked and sea-sprayed, and remembered the Luoyang Bridge, that solid and ancient stone of the northern Song, and remembered where I came from. I remembered its name as Zaiton. But its name is not Zaiton, a western name given it by Polo, Ibn Battuta and others. Its name is Quanzhou.\n\n\n\nWhen was I born? I searched my memories in vain. I found those from China; then those from India and Iran; further still, those from Africa, England, Utopia, Prester John, the Island of Tomorrow, the Patchwork Archipelago. And now, the more I think of them, the less certain I am. Where did they come from? Which souls did I draw them away from?\n\n\n\nBut through all these questions, some core of me still existed; some part of me remained an I, a fixed point, a first-person-pronoun. I stared upon those rocks and felt, dimly, that something had gone wrong.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nI - the central I - was born in Quanzhou in the Christian year 1266. I was the fifth child of a wealthy family; my father had done well under the old dynasty, rising to high office. But then the Mongols came, and suddenly the south Chinese were at the bottom of the imperial hierarchy. So my father retired to Quanzhou and began to build a fleet of merchant ships.\n\n\n\nWith those ships, he took advantage of the new links with the West which the era had ushered in. He became known as an exporter of cinnamon, using links with Muslim merchants to become even wealthier in private life. His new wife bore him three more children, in addition to the four sons from his youth; I was the first, my brother the second.\n\n\n\nMy brother would snivel around behind me while I stood behind pillars, peeping out at conversations and meetings. My father was a stern man; my feet were bound, my body and mind prepared for my future, a rote and sterile world.\n\n\n\nI wish I could say I was bold, adventurous. I wish I could say I was a rebel, chafing against the ties that held me down. But I was not. I was a dutiful girl; I loved and honoured my father, and wished to do what was right, what was moral. I left home by chance, not by my will.\n\n\n\nMy father's wealth was well-known around the city. They came by day, paying a member of the household guard. I was in a courtyard at that time, only eighteen, wandering between the flowers alone. The grass was a thick, dark green. The clouds were moving quickly across the sky. The air smelled of cinnamon.\n\n\n\nI was kidnapped; my father, overloaded with debts that suddenly came due, would or could not pay my ransom. I was, in the end, sold to a Persian merchant from the isle of Qish. I remember the hold of a junk, beams of light peeping out between slats in the wood. And that, more or less, should have been the end of my story. The details are different, but it's still the same; a rearrangement of specific parts, a bag of wood-block pages.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\nThe argument inside my head has been raging for centuries. I do not recall who the individuals were who began it, or their names; only their argument, which began long before me and will continue long after I am gone.\n\n\n\nOne of them believes that, when I touched the map, that was what sent us along the wrong sea-path; that was why we ended up in Madagascar when we should have been in Madurai, and a false Madagascar at that.

He would chew his cereal while looking at one specific point in the kitchen, at the top of a cabinet, where the wood met the plaster of the wall. He would think about a lot of things, but most often he would recall a memory from when he was very young. He was at school, crosslegged in the classroom, looking at a fence outside. It was metal, composed of little squares, an inch or two each in length. One day, he remembered the way it would shake when you ran against it, waving slightly to each side, up and down the line.</p>\n<p>After showering, dressing, eating breakfast and packing his things, he would get in his car and head to work. He always enjoyed the moment of stepping out of the building. The flats were slightly apart from the rest of the town, a little way up the side of the valley. Pine trees surrounded them; a little winding road took you down to the world. Sometimes, he would stop for a moment, listening to the rustle of wind within leaves; but then he'd remember that other people were in the building, looking out, and he'd open the door to his car and drive away.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Krupin did not work at Site-17, but as part of his broader responsibilities, he had been granted permission to act as the ritualist in a summoning attempt for <a href=\"/scp-7356\">SCP-7356</a>. He was a paraornithologist, a scholar of anomalous birds, and while 7356 was <em>not</em> a bird, it seemed to move in the same circles. So he'd applied for a permit, and had been accepted, and so had made the long journey by plane away from the pines and the valley.</p>\n<p>He did not like <a href=\"/site-17-hub\">Site-17</a>. It seemed a serious, snide place, full of long-suppressed emotion. The cruelty underpinning the Foundation vibrated more heavily there, like a taut, suspended wire. But he had remained polite, smiling, reserved throughout; and he had been granted permission to hold the skull, to place it on the wall, to witness the attendant's confused face as he told her that they were participating in a ritual.</p>\n<p>Then, when it was done, after he had made his notes on arm length, behavioural tics and head tilt, after the creature had vanished yet again, he had thanked the staff, collected his things, and left. The plane ride home had been chilly; it was just a little Cessna, battered and shoved by the wind. It was snowing lightly outside.</p>\n<p>His own place of work, Site-856, was warmer. Sometimes, in winter, when he was worn out from work, he would look out of the window. The yellow of the inside light, when compared to the wind and darkened skies outside - nothing felt warmer. Nothing felt cosier than knowing that he would not have to step out there for a few more minutes.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Krupin enjoyed working at Site-856. He was well-liked by his colleagues. His work was engaging to him. You didn't get into academia for the money - although the Foundation made sure to pay their staff well - but for a fascination with one's subject deep enough that you were willing to tolerate the career's indignities. You wanted to delve into it, uncover new knowledge, be the person who did not simply learn what was passed down but who'd push that veil back still further. That his work would remain largely unknown to the outside world didn't bother him; it would exist somewhere, in some vault, ready and waiting.</p>\n<p>He and his assistants had a quick, easy rapport. He was punctual and friendly. He was quite good at small talk, in a slightly affected way, someone who sees it as an amusing pastime more than something to be either engaged in or despised. He gave the impression of a man with a rich, full life. And despite living alone, despite his neat manners, you could argue that this wasn't entirely wrong. He'd get home and read, or watch an art film, and generally enjoy the silence.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, on grey or snowy nights, he would stare into the pine trees. A man could get lost in those trees. It seemed like a nice idea, sometimes; to be removed, piece by piece, and become more and more the bark and leaves, snow and wood. To be a little less oneself than before, with all the burdens that entailed.</p>\n<p>He'd smile at the thought, and go to sleep.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>But since the ritual, his sleep was a little different. The presence of the bird was not unusual - after all, he saw and dealt with birds every day, in cages or containment zones, in colours mundane and abnormal, in previously unknown shapes. They would spit at him, or bite, or shift through one plane to another. SCP-7356 had not, at first, left <em>so</em> great an impression on him, fascinating though it was. He expected birds in his dreams. They were his old friends.</p>\n<p>No, what was unusual was the hallway. It did not so much seem like the hallway the ritual had taken place in, despite the identical colouring and carpeting. Was it a bit too\u2026 small? Or was it that the bird, placed into it, altered his perception of its proportions? It glided through it in such a way that he couldn't resist tilting his head, like he was a camera, like he was creating a Dutch angle. The bird seemed not to glide, now, but to slide, casting itself along a smooth, polished surface. But it was not touching the ground.</p>\n<p>He woke up a little after four. He frowned.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"But it's not a bird. You really shouldn't keep calling it that. It's a humanoid with skin and a mouth.\" His assistant, Martha, was idly chatting with him during lunch. The canteen's bulbs were not as warm as in the office - white, staring things, a cold kind of light that kept the workers moving, not wanting to linger.</p>\n<p>\"Just because you use the skull to summon it, just because of the bird dreams everyone gets - it's still a humanoid. We still cannot be certain of the relation between birds and the figure. Maybe it is a bird in some way. Maybe it's the bird's prey. We simply don't know.\"</p>\n<p>Martha chattered on, stirring her soup. Krupin didn't answer her. He alternated between regarding her, the movement of her mouth, the tenor of her voice, and his own meal, into which he'd stirred a little olive oil. It made patterns on the surface, teetering and splitting, forming into strands and bubbles.</p>\n<p>After work, while driving home, a car passed by without its headlights on. It came out of nowhere; he had to swerve to miss it, screeching the car around a tricky bend. He swore, smashing the horn, but the other car careened past, pitch black, invisible in the night.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Why had he become an ornithologist?</p>\n<p>He had a story on hand for that question. When he was young, he'd lived near the coast, and he'd seen the sand martins come and go, nipping into the sea and darting back with fish for their young. He'd say that the combination of all these factors - the swift movements, the lives contained in their cliffside holes, the completeness of their existence laid out before him - had enchanted him, and he'd resolved to study these strange creatures and their ways.</p>\n<p>The truth was something he kept to himself, out of some vague sense that it was taboo. He'd been walking in the woods and had found a dead bird - a sparrow - lying on the ground. Its wing had been twisted unnaturally, half covered in mud. He'd taken a stick and lifted the wing, and in that moment had seen its splayed structure - its bones and feathers more spread out than a human could ever see in motion. Its structure that allowed it to lift up, into flight, into endless motions upon motions, a living machine, strung up on a wire nobody else could see but it. It was, in its own way, perfect.</p>\n<p>And a bird's expression was always silent. It might sing, might cry, might cry many times in panic, but it could not emote, change its features, like a human could. It moved through the air, cutting across it, slicing it, from food to mating to sleep to death. It constructed elaborate, intricate nests.</p>\n<p>And then there were the crows. They would twitch at him, tilting their heads. They'd use their beak and claws to lever chips from polystyrene boxes. It was a clich\u00e9 to speak of the intelligence of corvids, but it was hard to move on from that intense, fickle gaze, clicking around in his head like old machinery.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>That night, he did not dream of the bird, <a href=\"/scp-6124\">but of cattle</a>. He dreamt of his teeth, biting into their sides, of their surprised, moaning coos as the blood, wet and warm, spilt out. His teeth were so tiny, so multiplicitous. His gaze upon them did nothing to him, nothing.</p>\n<p>The next morning, he was late for the first time in years. Martha looked at him askance, but he seemed fine, and laughed off her questioning at lunch. He <em>was</em> fine. He asked for extra gravy on his beef at the canteen.</p>\n<p>As he went home, he took a different road, stopping in a layby. It was snowing. He got out, crunching underfoot, and stood at the edge of the pine trees. The smell was refreshing; the wet, cold flakes felt crisp against his skin. He stared into the forest for a long time, his eyes searching, as if looking for something, someone. A pair of eyes that weren't there.</p>\n<p>And then he got back into his car and went home.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>It is not known where the REAO-6124-A organism lived. All that remains is a skull.

Had the world ever been covered in anything but a blank, singular colour?</p>\n<p>He took one foot off the tree, letting it hover over the edge.

I am familiar with your living situation. You were aware of its status as an anomalous object when you arranged this, correct?\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Gears:</strong> \u201cYes, I was aware. Given the doctor\u2019s history of cooperation and lack of any <em>recent</em> events, I saw no reason why this would prevent our cohabitation.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Founder:</strong> \u201cI see. Explain to me what happened in that <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span>, from the beginning.\u201d</p>\n<p>[a pause]</p>\n<p><strong>Gears:</strong> \u201cApologies. Please allow me a moment to gather my thoughts\u2026 We returned home at our usual time\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow long have my tires been popped?\u201d Clef asks, walking in circles around his run down truck. Gears shuts the door of his car and joins Clef\u2019s side, feigning ignorance.</p>\n<p>\u201cStrange. Did you run over glass recently?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHaven\u2019t used this truck in\u2026\u201d Clef squints, scrunching up his forehead. \u201cWhatever\u2026 Whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was thinking of going for a drive tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTo where?\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef shakes his head and walks away from his truck. Opening the front door, Gears lets him step in first, locking the door behind him. Clef plops down in his usual seat, L.S. in his lap.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere is it you wanted to go?\u201d</p>\n<p>No answer.</p>\n<p>\u201cClef?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat ever happened to my old <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span>? Did you sell it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is still under your ownership. It is likely exactly how you left it. Why do you ask?\u201d Gears settles into the kitchen, continuing the conversation as he gathers dinner supplies.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust wondering.\u201d Threading his fingers through L.S.\u2019s furr, Clef stares, bleary eyed, at the far wall. He remains silent until the end of dinner.</p>\n<p><strong>Gears:</strong> \u201cI cooked dinner and we ate in silence. Even in retrospect, I can\u2019t recall anything strange about Clef\u2019s behavior until after. I washed the dishes and refilled his glass of water.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef perks up at the rattling sound of a pill bottle. He stands, knocking L.S. out of his lap, and leans on the island near Gears. \u201cOh, is it bedtime already? I lost track of time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gears glances over his shoulder. He feels the urge to defend himself despite being the one on offense. He drops a pill into the glass, letting it dissolve as usual.</p>\n<p>Examining his nails in a disinterested manner, Clef asks, \u201cYou feel like letting another pill fall in there? The nightmares\u2026 they always get worse around this time.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Gears:</strong> \u201cHe asked me if he could take an extra pill before he slept.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Founder:</strong> \u201cPill?\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Gears:</strong> \u201cA mild amnestic often used as sleeping medication. I have made sure Clef takes one every night in order to keep his sleeping cycle consistent.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Founder:</strong> \u201cI see. So he asked for twice his usual dose. And you gave it to him?\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Gears:</strong> \u201cI did.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Founder:</strong> \u201cDid anything about the request strike you as suspicious?\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Gears:</strong> \u201cI was confused by the question, but even now I have no reason to believe Clef had any malicious intent. I don\u2019t believe even he could have predicted what happened next.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gears awakens to the sound of L.S. yowling. Flipping onto his side, he covers his head with his pillow. Whatever was bothering the damn thing could wait until morning. L.S. digs its claws into the grain.</p>\n<p>As he turns over he feels something warm drip onto his face. He shots upright, out of his bed in seconds. With the lights on he sees his bed is soaked in red. There\u2019s a dark red spot on the ceiling and it\u2019s leaking.</p>\n<p><strong>Gears:</strong> \u201cI was awoken by a red liquid dripping from the ceiling. Directly above my room was Clef\u2019s, leading me to believe he was heavily injured.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gears wipes the blood off his cheek and runs for the door. L.S. immediately pounces into his arms. He cries out, flinging the cat away from him. It smacks against the wall and rushes to jump into his arms again. It\u2019s trembling so hard. Gears stumbles back, bumping into the door and slamming it shut.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s pitch black.</p>\n<p>He attempts to pry the cat off of him, but its claws are hooked into his clothes and skin. It would only cause him pain to try to shoo it away. Its fur is slightly wet and sticky. Gears resigns to his fate.</p>\n<p>He tries to reach for the doorknob or the light switch or anything that\u2019ll illuminate the space. Expect there\u2019s no wall behind him. He reaches out and grasps only darkness.</p>\n<p><strong>Gears:</strong> \u201cWhen I had left my room I was operating only under the assumption that Clef was heavily injured. The layout of my <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span> had changed. I believe this was his doing, if unintentionally.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gears walks forward, arm outstretched, hoping to find anything familiar. He knows the layout of this <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span> better than anything, he should be able to navigate this place with his eyes closed. He should have walked into a wall or a piece of furniture, instead he walks into a hospital room.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s as though he passed through a certain separating the two areas, walking across an unseen threshold. The change is so sudden it hurts his eyes. There\u2019s a door behind him. He could leave.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s someone on the bed. He recognizes her instantly. He can\u2019t move, can\u2019t breathe, can\u2019t blink. She smiles at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cCharles, come here! Look at <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/blackened\">our child</a>.\u201d Leanne Chao holds out a bundle of blankets. Against his will, he joins her side. A face pokes out of the bundle, eyes closed, still as death.</p>\n<p>Gears takes the bundle in his arms, gently letting his thumb slide across her cheek. So small, so fragile. How such a soft, pitiful little thing could ever become something like him\u2026</p>\n<p><em>Gear thinks, for a long time, about raising his Alison, about his letting Alison become like him. She\u2019ll never understand. There\u2019s a mold that grows in him that <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/splinters\">he can not allow to grow in her</a>.</em></p>\n<p>Alison doesn\u2019t stir even a little as she begins to slip through Gears\u2019s fingers. Like sand. Leanne looks at him with such softness in her eyes, such oblivion. Bits of Alison scatter across the floor, sweeping inbetween the cracks in the tiles. Gears swallows down vomit.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, dear?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Our daughter is dead! She\u2019s scattered across the floor. I\u2019ve broken her, don\u2019t you see I\u2019ve broken her?</em></p>\n<p>He can\u2019t stop shaking. A sharp pain shoots up his arm. L.S.\u2019s claws dig until they draw blood. He sees now, in the light of the hospital room, that L.S. is drenched in blood. Clef\u2019s blood.</p>\n<p><em>He needs to get to Clef.</em></p>\n<p>He turns his back to her and marches towards the door. As he grabs the doorknob he hears her call out to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere are you going, honey?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Leanne Chao is dead. She may have lived and breathed for another thirty years after you disappeared, but you killed her the second you left and never looked back. You\u2019re about to kill her again.</em></p>\n<p>[Gears does not turn around, he can not stand to face his own guilt. <em>Exit: stage right</em>]</p>\n<p><strong>Gears:</strong> \u201cI eventually found the kitchen. I remembered I owned a package of glow sticks for emergencies.\u201d</p>\n<p>He can tell it\u2019s the kitchen, the floor is different here. The counters are exactly where they should be. Feeling along the sides he finds a drawer and pulls out a package of three hundred glow sticks. These things are finally seeing a use.</p>\n<p><em>Snap.</em></p>\n<p>He tucks the package under his arm with the cat. The glow stick doesn\u2019t illuminate much but this is in fact his kitchen. He finds the space where the island separates the kitchen and the dinning room. He should be able to see the stairs from here.</p>\n<p><em>Should</em> being the key word there.</p>\n<p>Thinking quickly, he attempts to throw a glow stick towards the general direction. It clatters against the ground, barely a speck in the darkness. But it\u2019s something. Gears snaps another glow stick and prepares to make another th-</p>\n<p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p>\n<p>He spins around fast enough to make L.S. tense. He points the light outwards, as if brandishing a weapon. For a moment the voice that called out to him sounded like his Alison, but the little girl before him doesn\u2019t look anything like her. She doesn\u2019t look like anything at all.</p>\n<p>Gears could focus on any one of her features separately. He could tell you the color of her eyes, the shape of her nose, the exact way her hair falls. But to try to combine those features in his mind left him with a headache. The only clear features are her two large <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-166\">antlers and hooves</a>.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you help me? I\u2019m lost. I think my father\u2019s here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s upstairs,\u201d is all Gears can force out. L.S. wriggles out of Gears\u2019s arms and leaps onto the little girl. It\u2019s a wonder it doesn\u2019t knock her to the ground.</p>\n<p>She giggles, threading her fingers through its bloodsoaked fur. \u201cKitty!\u201d She and the cat look up at Gears, four pleading eyes staring him down. \u201cWill you help me find my dad?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Gears gives her a cracked glow stick and takes her hand. As they exit the kitchen he swears he can hear a third set of footsteps behind him.</p>\n<p><strong>Founder:</strong> \u201cThe anomaly. What happened with the anomaly?\u201d</p>\n<p>[Gears audibly swallows]</p>\n<p><strong>Gears:</strong> \u201cIt seems as though, in Clef\u2019s loss of control, he manifested several entities representative of things he knew about.\u201d</p>\n<p>[And things that would have been impossible for him to know about]</p>\n<p>As Gears and the girl exit the kitchen, walking straight into a blizzard. L.S. yowls and the little girl clings to his side. The snow crunches under his bare feet, the ice slicing into his exposed skin. This cold is familiar. In the distance, barely visible over the wind and hail, is the glow stick.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo cold\u2026\u201d she whimpers. Gears would offer her a coat if he\u2026 oh he is wearing a coat. He takes off his coat and wraps it around the little girl. He can handle the cold, he has handled this cold before.</p>\n<p>Sitting on the stairs is Dr. Iceberg, his brain leaking out onto the snow. He looks almost casual, his chin propped up on his fists. He gives Gears an unimpressed, bordering on disappointed look.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t get any closer to me.\u201d Iceberg points a handgun at Gears. Instinctively, Gears puts himself between him and the little girl. His legs tremble, every breath is sharp and painful.</p>\n<p>\u201cIceberg-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t really want to hear whatever you have to say to me. I never really liked hearing you talk at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI just need to get to the stairs.\u201d</p>\n<p>Iceberg\u2019s eye twitches. \u201cTo go see Clef? I think he\u2019s busy right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s injured. He may need some help.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh <em>he\u2019s injured, huh!?</em> Fucking look at me, Cog! I\u2019ve got a <em>fucking hole</em> in my skull!\u201d Iceberg smacks the side of his head with his palm, splattering brain matter on the steps and snow.</p>\n<p>Gears finds himself at a loss for words. \u201cYou\u2019re dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally? I hadn\u2019t noticed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gears bears his teeth. \u201cYou\u2019re dead. You shouldn\u2019t still be here. I <em>need</em> to get to Clef!\u201d He tries to raise his voice but the blizzard winds pick up, drowning him out. It\u2019s so hard to stand.</p>\n<p>A smirk pulls on Iceberg\u2019s lips. \u201cOh that was almost cute. Your impressions are getting better. I almost believed you cared about him.\u201d Iceberg scratches the side of his head with the barrel of the gun. The little girl clings to Gears\u2019s leg, he can feel Clef\u2019s blood sticking to his pants.</p>\n<p>\u201cIceberg\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought shooting myself would get me out of here, but I guess enough of <em>me</em> got trapped in your walls that I\u2019ll always be in here. Fucked up, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you.\u201d Gears doesn\u2019t even mean to say it, it just slips out among all the other things he desperately wants to tell him. Iceberg scoffs.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, for the longest time I didn\u2019t know what to think of you. I mean you were hot, and my boss. But- y\u2019know I mostly just thought you were an asshole. I mean god knows everyone else here is! Whatever\u2019s left of them anyway. It was easy- looking at everything you did and didn\u2019t do and just thinking: <em>\u2018Well, obviously that makes sense. He\u2019s an asshole, <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/termination-log-scp-1016\">why would he care?</a>\u2019</em></p>\n<p>But the more I think about it, the more I watched you over and over, I realized you\u2019re just a <em>filthy</em> coward. And everything just clicked! You\u2019re just a <em>coward</em> like the rest of us! And I\u2019ll prove it.\u201d</p>\n<p>[Iceberg brings the pistol up to what\u2019s left of his forehead and for the second time Gears does nothing to stop him. He has enough time to run for it but instead he covers the little girl\u2019s ears. The gunshot makes L.S. yowl]</p>\n<p>Gears opens his eyes, unsure of when he closed them. Iceberg lies still, sprawled out on the stairs. The little girl is crying, pressing her red face into L.S.\u2019s furr. They need to get out of this cold.</p>\n<p>He picks the little girl up and places her over Iceberg, trying desperately not to look down. He retches as the scent of blood <em>really</em> hits him. <em>He\u2019s been dead for years, don\u2019t think about it</em>.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t help himself though. He steps over the corpse, Iceberg\u2019s blood thawing out his frozen feet. He makes it up a few steps before it weighs on him too much. Turning around, he gives Iceberg one last look. In the snow, leading up to the stairs, there are three sets of footprints.</p>\n<p><strong>Gears:</strong> \u201cI believe that several of the\u2026 manifestations\u2026 were meant to deter us from reaching him. We pushed onward.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Founder:</strong> \u201cUs?\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Gears:</strong> \u201c<em>Er- I</em>. My mistake.\u201d</p>\n<p>Last Gears checked, his home did not have a spiral staircase. He kept waiting for the moment when he would reach the wall and turn, but it never came. The only sign he\u2019s getting anywhere is the trail of glow sticks he drops behind himself and what he hopes is the distant echo of his own footsteps.</p>\n<p>\u201cMister\u2026\u201d Gears flinches.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d The little girl struggles and stumbles over every step. Gears stops and picks her up, the cat in one arm and her in the other.</p>\n<p>He has no way to measure how long he spends coiling himself around the spiral stairs. His legs ache, his feet numb, the <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span> deathly silent. His own panting breath keeps him company.</p>\n<p>The ground grows slick and wet beneath his feet. In the distance he sees the outline of a door. Flowing out from under the door, like a great, disgusting waterfall, is blood.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re almost to your father,\u201d Gears whispers. She whimpers, pressing her face into the crook of his neck. Her antlers scratch his face.</p>\n<p>A tall figure stands before the door, a lone, lumbering guard. Kondraki fixes his eyes on Gears, blood leaking from the hole on his forehead. His butterflies swarm and flutter about him. Gears stops, leaving a few steps between them.</p>\n<p>\u201cKondraki,\u201d he says, barely a whisper. \u201cYou of all people should desire Clef\u2019s safety.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s safer without you. You break everything you touch.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gears\u2019s jaw trembles. \u201cI didn\u2019t break you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh really now? You know the exit wound is always bigger than the entrance wound. Fun little tidbit you ought to know.\u201d He points to the head wound.</p>\n<p>Something akin to rage boils in his stomach. Gears could blame himself for every loss he\u2019s ever experienced, but Kondraki- he <em>saved</em> Kondraki!</p>\n<p>\u201cI did not kill you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Kondraki snears. He takes a step forward, and like the tides of the red sea, the butterflies part ways around him. Gears stares down the barrel of a gun in the hands of <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/portraits-of-your-father\">Draven Kondraki</a>.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou thought if you sent me away I wouldn\u2019t find out what you did? You were terrified of me, the perfect token of your guilt, of the promise you failed to keep.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gears lets out a shuddering breath. \u201cI did not kill your father.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes you did. You may not have put a bullet through his head, but he\u2019s gone because of you. You couldn\u2019t stand to look at me, couldn\u2019t risk that I would pick up on the <em>mold</em> that\u2019s settled in your stomach.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draven takes a step forward. Gears tries to take a step back, but the ground is so slick he nearly slips.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know what you\u2019ve done. You can try and try and try to run and hide, but I know. And you know I know, you know I hate you for what you did. You know that one day, I\u2019ll walk into your office and do this-\u201d</p>\n<p>Draven presses the gun to Gears\u2019s forehead and mid sentence he crumbles into butterflies before him. The little girl goes limp in his grasp and Gears finds he\u2019s holding a bouquet of flowers. The cat squirms.</p>\n<p>Footsteps echo from behind him. He barely has time to react before someone grabs him from behind.</p>\n<p>\u201cDad- we have to get out of here!\u201d Alison- she looks like a full grown woman, like her mother. Gears wriggles out of her grasp.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. No! Leave me alone!\u201d He\u2019s so close to Clef. Clef needs his help, he doesn\u2019t have time for more guilt! \u201cJust go away!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis place is too dangerous. I know there\u2019s someone you care about in there but you can\u2019t help him! Please, just come with me! My reality anchor is only so strong.\u201d</p>\n<p>She grabs his shoulder and his last bit of resolve snaps. She\u2019s just another <em>joke</em> the <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span> is playing on him, another lingering regret. He shoves her as hard as he can. She loses her footing, disappearing down the spiral staircase. Her shout of fear is swallowed by the darkness. L.S. screams and jumps out of his arms, following her down.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s it. Nothing is in his way anymore. He makes it up the last few steps and-</p>\n<p><strong>Gears:</strong> \u201cWhen I opened Clef\u2019s door it was as though <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dying-out-west\">I stepped into a stage</a>.

They don't agree and that's all there is to it.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Clef:</strong> \u201cBut all four were there. And only one speaks of a thief being saved. Why believe him rather than the others?\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Gears:</strong> \u201cWho believes him?\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Clef:</strong> \u201cEverybody.

It was only Clef and myself. Until the MTF came in.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Founder:</strong> \u201cIs that so? Commander Kondraki said he found an unconscious woman at the bottom of the stairs. She escaped capture before she could be identified. And you don\u2019t know anything about that?\u201d</p>\n<p>[Gears swallows]</p>\n<p><strong>Gears:</strong> \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Founder:</strong> \u201cNo?\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Gears:</strong> \u201cNo. I did not know there was another person in the <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span> that night.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Founder:</strong> \u201cInteresting. I suppose the only matter left at hand is what to do with the anomaly.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Gears:</strong> \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Founder:</strong> \u201cWe can\u2019t let an incident like this go without any action. SCP-4231-B caused a huge breach in security, putting an MTF squad and a <em>senior doctor</em> at risk, as well as an unidentified citizen. In all likelihood, we\u2019ll have to move the anomaly to permanent containment.\u201d</p>\n<p>[Gears wants to scream, wants to shout, wants to cry, pull out his hair, claw out his eyes, vomit blood, do anything to release the tight coil of energy built up inside of him. He does not. If he breaks before his father, he won\u2019t just lose Clef]</p>\n<p><strong>Gears:</strong> \u201cI would highly recommend not doing that.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Founder:</strong> \u201cOh?\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Gears:</strong> \u201cDr. Clef has shown considerable loyalty to the Foundation, and, up until this point, he has maintained control of his anomaly. I believe that this recent outburst is purely due to our cohabitation. I was\u2026 not as accommodating to him as I could have been. I believe permanent containment would only rob an innocent man of his freedom, as well as rob the Foundation of a good worker.\u201d</p>\n<p>[Gears continues to pretend he has any control over himself]</p>\n<p><strong>Founder:</strong> \u201cI will take this into consideration when discussing this with the council. It will be held in temporary containment for the time being.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Gears:</strong> \u201cI understand, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Founder:</strong> \u201cAs for you\u2026 Your behavior during this interview is disturbing to say the least. Needless to say, I expect better from you.\u201d</p>\n<p>[Gears says nothing]</p>\n<p><strong>Founder:</strong> \u201cUnless you have anything else to confess, I believe this interview is concluded.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Gears:</strong> \u201cOf course. Thank you for your time.\u201d</p>\n<p>[Founder exits the interview room]</p>\n<p>Gears blinks his eyes. He\u2019s standing in front of his <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span>, key in hand. His hands are trembling too much for him to slot the key in right. He stands there for several minutes before he\u2019s able to get inside.</p>\n<p>Excluding the reality anchors stationed around, the <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span> is exactly how he left it. The door opens without a sound, the lights work, the rooms are the same size they\u2019ve always been\u2026 at least he thinks so. He should measure when he gets the chance.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a puddle of blood at the bottom of the stairs.</p>\n<p>His daughter\u2019s blood.</p>\n<p>In a puddle.</p>\n<p>At the bottom of the stairs.</p>\n<p><em>You did that to her.</em></p>\n<p>Vomit spills from his mouth before he can stop himself. It\u2019s mostly just bile and acid, he hasn\u2019t really had anything solid in weeks. He falls to his knees and pukes until his stomach <em>aches</em> and he can\u2019t feel his throat.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t move. Feels like the very floor is grabbing him, pulling him in. Every part of him aches and throbs.</p>\n<p><em>He needs to go to bed. It\u2019s way too late.</em></p>\n<p>Feeling weightless, like a ghost, Gears stands and walks to his bedroom. He stops, still, right before his bedroom door. Slowly, his entire body trembling, he turns around. Directly across from his bedroom door is a set of double doors he\u2019s never seen before.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s nothing particularly strange about the doors themselves. It\u2019s odd to have two of them side by side, but it\u2019s no different to the storage closet upstairs. The doors even match the style of the <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span>. Gears could believe that these doors were installed when the very <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span> was built.</p>\n<p>It takes a while of just observing the imobile doors for Gears to work up the nerve to put his hand on the doorknob. Even once it\u2019s there it takes time for him to turn it.</p>\n<p>When he does, instead of entering into his office or a storage closet or anything that could have been reasonable, it opens into a hallway. Pitchblack, Gears can\u2019t see a thing inside, but staring down the hall he gets the same sinking feeling one gets when staring over a pit. Like one little slip and he\u2019ll fall in and never return.</p>\n<p>Nobody is standing in the doorway. They stare at each other for a long time.</p>\n<p><strong>Gears:</strong> \u201cThat's it, then, is it?\u201d [Long silence] \u201cThe sun's going down.

Gears shuts the door of his car and joins Clef\u2019s side, feigning ignorance. \n\n\n\n\u201cStrange. Did you run over glass recently?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t used this truck in\u2026\u201d Clef squints, scrunching up his forehead. \u201cWhatever\u2026 Whatever.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI was thinking of going for a drive tonight.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cTo where?\u201d \n\n\n\nClef shakes his head and walks away from his truck. Opening the front door, Gears lets him step in first, locking the door behind him. Clef plops down in his usual seat, L.S. in his lap. \n\n\n\n\u201cWhere is it you wanted to go?\u201d \n\n\n\nNo answer. \n\n\n\n\u201cClef?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat ever happened to my old [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]]? Did you sell it?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cIt is still under your ownership. It is likely exactly how you left it. Why do you ask?\u201d Gears settles into the kitchen, continuing the conversation as he gathers dinner supplies. \n\n\n\n\u201cJust wondering.\u201d Threading his fingers through L.S.\u2019s furr, Clef stares, bleary eyed, at the far wall. He remains silent until the end of dinner. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**Gears:** \u201cI cooked dinner and we ate in silence. Even in retrospect, I can\u2019t recall anything strange about Clef\u2019s behavior until after. I washed the dishes and refilled his glass of water.\u201d \n\n\n\nClef perks up at the rattling sound of a pill bottle. He stands, knocking L.S. out of his lap, and leans on the island near Gears. \u201cOh, is it bedtime already? I lost track of time.\u201d \n\n\n\nGears glances over his shoulder. He feels the urge to defend himself despite being the one on offense. He drops a pill into the glass, letting it dissolve as usual. \n\n\n\nExamining his nails in a disinterested manner, Clef asks, \u201cYou feel like letting another pill fall in there? The nightmares\u2026 they always get worse around this time.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**Gears:** \u201cHe asked me if he could take an extra pill before he slept.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**Founder:** \u201cPill?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**Gears:** \u201cA mild amnestic often used as sleeping medication. I have made sure Clef takes one every night in order to keep his sleeping cycle consistent.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**Founder:** \u201cI see. So he asked for twice his usual dose. And you gave it to him?\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**Gears:** \u201cI did.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**Founder:** \u201cDid anything about the request strike you as suspicious?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**Gears:** \u201cI was confused by the question, but even now I have no reason to believe Clef had any malicious intent. I don\u2019t believe even he could have predicted what happened next.\u201d \n\n\n\nGears awakens to the sound of L.S. yowling. Flipping onto his side, he covers his head with his pillow. Whatever was bothering the damn thing could wait until morning. L.S. digs its claws into the grain.\n\n\n\nAs he turns over he feels something warm drip onto his face. He shots upright, out of his bed in seconds. With the lights on he sees his bed is soaked in red. There\u2019s a dark red spot on the ceiling and it\u2019s leaking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**Gears:** \u201cI was awoken by a red liquid dripping from the ceiling. Directly above my room was Clef\u2019s, leading me to believe he was heavily injured.\u201d \n\n\n\nGears wipes the blood off his cheek and runs for the door. L.S. immediately pounces into his arms. He cries out, flinging the cat away from him. It smacks against the wall and rushes to jump into his arms again. It\u2019s trembling so hard. Gears stumbles back, bumping into the door and slamming it shut. \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s pitch black. \n\n\n\nHe attempts to pry the cat off of him, but its claws are hooked into his clothes and skin. It would only cause him pain to try to shoo it away. Its fur is slightly wet and sticky. Gears resigns to his fate. \n\n\n\nHe tries to reach for the doorknob or the light switch or anything that\u2019ll illuminate the space. Expect there\u2019s no wall behind him. He reaches out and grasps only darkness. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**Gears:** \u201cWhen I had left my room I was operating only under the assumption that Clef was heavily injured. The layout of my [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]] had changed. I believe this was his doing, if unintentionally.\u201d \n\n\n\nGears walks forward, arm outstretched, hoping to find anything familiar. He knows the layout of this [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]] better than anything, he should be able to navigate this place with his eyes closed. He should have walked into a wall or a piece of furniture, instead he walks into a hospital room.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s as though he passed through a certain separating the two areas, walking across an unseen threshold. The change is so sudden it hurts his eyes. There\u2019s a door behind him. He could leave. \n\n\n\nThere\u2019s someone on the bed. He recognizes her instantly. He can\u2019t move, can\u2019t breathe, can\u2019t blink. She smiles at him. \n\n\n\n\u201cCharles, come here! Look at [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/blackened our child].\u201d Leanne Chao holds out a bundle of blankets. Against his will, he joins her side. A face pokes out of the bundle, eyes closed, still as death. \n\n\n\nGears takes the bundle in his arms, gently letting his thumb slide across her cheek. So small, so fragile. How such a soft, pitiful little thing could ever become something like him\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//Gear thinks, for a long time, about raising his Alison, about his letting Alison become like him. She\u2019ll never understand. There\u2019s a mold that grows in him that [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/splinters he can not allow to grow in her].//\n\n\n\n\n\nAlison doesn\u2019t stir even a little as she begins to slip through Gears\u2019s fingers. Like sand. Leanne looks at him with such softness in her eyes, such oblivion. Bits of Alison scatter across the floor, sweeping inbetween the cracks in the tiles. Gears swallows down vomit. \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, dear?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//Our daughter is dead! She\u2019s scattered across the floor. I\u2019ve broken her, don\u2019t you see I\u2019ve broken her?//\n\n\n\n\n\nHe can\u2019t stop shaking. A sharp pain shoots up his arm. L.S.\u2019s claws dig until they draw blood. He sees now, in the light of the hospital room, that L.S. is drenched in blood. Clef\u2019s blood.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n//He needs to get to Clef.//\n\n\n\n\n\nHe turns his back to her and marches towards the door. As he grabs the doorknob he hears her call out to him. \n\n\n\n\u201cWhere are you going, honey?\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//Leanne Chao is dead. She may have lived and breathed for another thirty years after you disappeared, but you killed her the second you left and never looked back. You\u2019re about to kill her again.//\n\n\n\n\n\n[Gears does not turn around, he can not stand to face his own guilt. //Exit: stage right//] \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**Gears:** \u201cI eventually found the kitchen. I remembered I owned a package of glow sticks for emergencies.\u201d \n\n\n\nHe can tell it\u2019s the kitchen, the floor is different here. The counters are exactly where they should be. Feeling along the sides he finds a drawer and pulls out a package of three hundred glow sticks. These things are finally seeing a use. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//Snap.//\n\n\n\nHe tucks the package under his arm with the cat. The glow stick doesn\u2019t illuminate much but this is in fact his kitchen. He finds the space where the island separates the kitchen and the dinning room. He should be able to see the stairs from here.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n//Should// being the key word there. \n\n\n\nThinking quickly, he attempts to throw a glow stick towards the general direction. It clatters against the ground, barely a speck in the darkness. But it\u2019s something. Gears snaps another glow stick and prepares to make another th-\n\n\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d \n\n\n\nHe spins around fast enough to make L.S. tense. He points the light outwards, as if brandishing a weapon. For a moment the voice that called out to him sounded like his Alison, but the little girl before him doesn\u2019t look anything like her. She doesn\u2019t look like anything at all. \n\n\n\nGears could focus on any one of her features separately. He could tell you the color of her eyes, the shape of her nose, the exact way her hair falls. But to try to combine those features in his mind left him with a headache. The only clear features are her two large [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-166 antlers and hooves]. \n\n\n\n\u201cCan you help me? I\u2019m lost. I think my father\u2019s here.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s upstairs,\u201d is all Gears can force out. L.S. wriggles out of Gears\u2019s arms and leaps onto the little girl. It\u2019s a wonder it doesn\u2019t knock her to the ground. \n\n\n\nShe giggles, threading her fingers through its bloodsoaked fur. \u201cKitty!\u201d She and the cat look up at Gears, four pleading eyes staring him down. \u201cWill you help me find my dad?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cAlright.\u201d Gears gives her a cracked glow stick and takes her hand. As they exit the kitchen he swears he can hear a third set of footsteps behind him. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**Founder:** \u201cThe anomaly. What happened with the anomaly?\u201d \n\n\n\n[Gears audibly swallows]\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**Gears:** \u201cIt seems as though, in Clef\u2019s loss of control, he manifested several entities representative of things he knew about.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0[And things that would have been impossible for him to know about]\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0As Gears and the girl exit the kitchen, walking straight into a blizzard. L.S. yowls and the little girl clings to his side. The snow crunches under his bare feet, the ice slicing into his exposed skin. This cold is familiar. In the distance, barely visible over the wind and hail, is the glow stick. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSo cold\u2026\u201d she whimpers. Gears would offer her a coat if he\u2026 oh he is wearing a coat. He takes off his coat and wraps it around the little girl. He can handle the cold, he has handled this cold before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Sitting on the stairs is Dr. Iceberg, his brain leaking out onto the snow. He looks almost casual, his chin propped up on his fists. He gives Gears an unimpressed, bordering on disappointed look. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t get any closer to me.\u201d Iceberg points a handgun at Gears. Instinctively, Gears puts himself between him and the little girl. His legs tremble, every breath is sharp and painful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIceberg-\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t really want to hear whatever you have to say to me. I never really liked hearing you talk at all.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI just need to get to the stairs.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Iceberg\u2019s eye twitches. \u201cTo go see Clef? I think he\u2019s busy right now.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s injured. He may need some help.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOh //he\u2019s injured, huh!?// Fucking look at me, Cog! I\u2019ve got a //fucking hole// in my skull!\u201d Iceberg smacks the side of his head with his palm, splattering brain matter on the steps and snow. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Gears finds himself at a loss for words. \u201cYou\u2019re dead.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cReally? I hadn\u2019t noticed.\u201d \n\n\n\nGears bears his teeth. \u201cYou\u2019re dead. You shouldn\u2019t still be here. I //need// to get to Clef!\u201d He tries to raise his voice but the blizzard winds pick up, drowning him out. It\u2019s so hard to stand.\n\n\n\nA smirk pulls on Iceberg\u2019s lips. \u201cOh that was almost cute. Your impressions are getting better. I almost believed you cared about him.\u201d Iceberg scratches the side of his head with the barrel of the gun. The little girl clings to Gears\u2019s leg, he can feel Clef\u2019s blood sticking to his pants. \n\n\n\n\u201cIceberg\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI thought shooting myself would get me out of here, but I guess enough of //me// got trapped in your walls that I\u2019ll always be in here. Fucked up, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI love you.\u201d Gears doesn\u2019t even mean to say it, it just slips out among all the other things he desperately wants to tell him. Iceberg scoffs. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou know, for the longest time I didn\u2019t know what to think of you. I mean you were hot, and my boss. But- y\u2019know I mostly just thought you were an asshole. I mean god knows everyone else here is! Whatever\u2019s left of them anyway. It was easy- looking at everything you did and didn\u2019t do and just thinking: //\u2018Well, obviously that makes sense. He\u2019s an asshole, [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/termination-log-scp-1016 why would he care?]\u2019//\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the more I think about it, the more I watched you over and over, I realized you\u2019re just a //filthy// coward. And everything just clicked! You\u2019re just a //coward// like the rest of us! And I\u2019ll prove it.\u201d \n\n\n\n[Iceberg brings the pistol up to what\u2019s left of his forehead and for the second time Gears does nothing to stop him. He has enough time to run for it but instead he covers the little girl\u2019s ears. The gunshot makes L.S. yowl]\n\n\n\nGears opens his eyes, unsure of when he closed them. Iceberg lies still, sprawled out on the stairs. The little girl is crying, pressing her red face into L.S.\u2019s furr. They need to get out of this cold. \n\n\n\nHe picks the little girl up and places her over Iceberg, trying desperately not to look down. He retches as the scent of blood //really// hits him. //He\u2019s been dead for years, don\u2019t think about it//. \n\n\n\nHe can\u2019t help himself though. He steps over the corpse, Iceberg\u2019s blood thawing out his frozen feet. He makes it up a few steps before it weighs on him too much. Turning around, he gives Iceberg one last look. In the snow, leading up to the stairs, there are three sets of footprints. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**Gears:** \u201cI believe that several of the\u2026 manifestations\u2026 were meant to deter us from reaching him. We pushed onward.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**Founder:** \u201cUs?\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**Gears:** \u201c//Er- I//. My mistake.\u201d \n\n\n\nLast Gears checked, his home did not have a spiral staircase. He kept waiting for the moment when he would reach the wall and turn, but it never came. The only sign he\u2019s getting anywhere is the trail of glow sticks he drops behind himself and what he hopes is the distant echo of his own footsteps. \n\n\n\n\u201cMister\u2026\u201d Gears flinches. \n\n\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d The little girl struggles and stumbles over every step. Gears stops and picks her up, the cat in one arm and her in the other. \n\n\n\nHe has no way to measure how long he spends coiling himself around the spiral stairs. His legs ache, his feet numb, the [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]] deathly silent. His own panting breath keeps him company. \n\n\n\nThe ground grows slick and wet beneath his feet. In the distance he sees the outline of a door. Flowing out from under the door, like a great, disgusting waterfall, is blood. \n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re almost to your father,\u201d Gears whispers.

Kondraki shakes his head and exits, stage left. The bedroom door bursts down. //Enter:// **Draven** (//as an MTF commander//).

Once I reached Clef\u2019s bedroom I found him lying in bed heavily injured.

You\u2019re lucky they sent the MTF.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**Gears:** \u201cVery lucky sir.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**Founder:** \u201cTell me, were you aware of anyone else in your [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]] when the anomaly began acting up?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**Gears:** \u201cNo sir. It was only Clef and myself. Until the MTF came in.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**Founder:** \u201cIs that so? Commander Kondraki said he found an unconscious woman at the bottom of the stairs. She escaped capture before she could be identified.

I suppose the only matter left at hand is what to do with the anomaly.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**Gears:** \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**Founder:** \u201cWe can\u2019t let an incident like this go without any action. SCP-4231-B caused a huge breach in security, putting an MTF squad and a //senior doctor// at risk, as well as an unidentified citizen.

He does not.

I believe that this recent outburst is purely due to our cohabitation. I was\u2026 not as accommodating to him as I could have been. I believe permanent containment would only rob an innocent man of his freedom, as well as rob the Foundation of a good worker.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0[Gears continues to pretend he has any control over himself]\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**Founder:** \u201cI will take this into consideration when discussing this with the council.

Needless to say, I expect better from you.\u201d \n\n\n\n[Gears says nothing]\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**Founder:** \u201cUnless you have anything else to confess, I believe this interview is concluded.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**Gears:** \u201cOf course. Thank you for your time.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0[Founder exits the interview room] \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Gears blinks his eyes. He\u2019s standing in front of his [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]], key in hand. His hands are trembling too much for him to slot the key in right. He stands there for several minutes before he\u2019s able to get inside. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Excluding the reality anchors stationed around, the [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]] is exactly how he left it. The door opens without a sound, the lights work, the rooms are the same size they\u2019ve always been\u2026 at least he thinks so. He should measure when he gets the chance. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0There\u2019s a puddle of blood at the bottom of the stairs. \n\n\n\nHis daughter\u2019s blood. \n\n\n\nIn a puddle. \n\n\n\nAt the bottom of the stairs. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//You did that to her.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Vomit spills from his mouth before he can stop himself. It\u2019s mostly just bile and acid, he hasn\u2019t really had anything solid in weeks. He falls to his knees and pukes until his stomach //aches// and he can\u2019t feel his throat. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0He can\u2019t move. Feels like the very floor is grabbing him, pulling him in. Every part of him aches and throbs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//He needs to go to bed. It\u2019s way too late.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Feeling weightless, like a ghost, Gears stands and walks to his bedroom. He stops, still, right before his bedroom door. Slowly, his entire body trembling, he turns around. Directly across from his bedroom door is a set of double doors he\u2019s never seen before. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0There\u2019s nothing particularly strange about the doors themselves. It\u2019s odd to have two of them side by side, but it\u2019s no different to the storage closet upstairs. The doors even match the style of the [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]]. Gears could believe that these doors were installed when the very [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]] was built. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0It takes a while of just observing the imobile doors for Gears to work up the nerve to put his hand on the doorknob. Even once it\u2019s there it takes time for him to turn it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0When he does, instead of entering into his office or a storage closet or anything that could have been reasonable, it opens into a hallway. Pitchblack, Gears can\u2019t see a thing inside, but staring down the hall he gets the same sinking feeling one gets when staring over a pit. Like one little slip and he\u2019ll fall in and never return. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Nobody is standing in the doorway. They stare at each other for a long time. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**Gears:** \u201cThat's it, then, is it?\u201d [Long silence] \u201cThe sun's going down. Or the earth's coming up, as the fashionable theory has it.

I don't care. I've had enough. To tell you the truth, I'm relieved.\u201d \n\n\n\n[He steps over the threshold, into the hallway]\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**Nobody:** \u201cOur names shouted in a certain dawn... a message... a summons... there must have been a moment, at the beginning, where we could have said- //no//. But somehow we missed it.\u201d \n\n\n\n[Nobody steps over the threshold, into the [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0**Gears:** \u201cWell, we'll know better next time. Now you see me, //now you-//\u201d \n\n\n\n[The door closes.

It had expected the ritual to snap it into PIC's body instantaneously, but it had instead happened slowly, a fade from its place behind Earth's Luna to a body of flesh and blood, of sinew and bone.</p>\n<p>The first sense to come was sight, but PIC had closed his eyes, so there wasn't much to see just yet.</p>\n<p>The second was hearing. Eli heard the buzz of a desk fan somewhere to its left. It heard the chirping of birds outside, dampened by a closed window. It heard someone, presumably Jude, move slightly. His clothes rubbed against a carpet, creating a scratchy sort of sound. Every sound was so much more noticeable, so much <em>more</em>, with human ears to catch them.</p>\n<p>The third sense was feeling. A slight wind passed by it, likely the fan oscillating. The air ruffled its sleeve, rubbing the plush fabric against PIC's arm- its arm, for now. A silky substance passed through its fingers, falling to the floor. It felt like what Eli imagined sand to feel like. The air in the room was wet and heavy, something it didn't know air could be.</p>\n<p>It took a breath in. The fourth sense was scent. There were only two distinct scents Eli could put words to, the rest a muddled, warm musk. A soft scent cut through it first, something misty and comforting. It reminded it of how its friend Lily described the scents of flowers. The other scent was much fainter, but it was there. Something much more damp and pungent, that reminded it of what swamps and marshes look like.</p>\n<p>The last was taste. There wasn't much there, as Eli wasn't eating anything, but there was a slight pang on its tongue. PIC had probably eaten something sour or spicy, going off of what it knew of how its friends described those tastes.</p>\n<p>Eli opened its eyes, taking in the room. It was bare, with nothing notable in its view. Jude was directly across from it, watching it as it took long, deep breaths, adjusting to now having lungs and hands and a human body, at least for now.</p>\n<p>There was a difference, it now fully understood, in how it saw the world compared to how humans did. It had seen pictures of Jude, but with him sitting in front of it, it could see details it had never noticed before. His sclerae were tinted red, irritation from smoking marijuana. His hair was dry and thin, hidden under a large grey ushanka. There was a small stain on the front of his hoodie, one knee of his jeans was torn with threads stretched across, his socks were dirty with sweat.</p>\n<p>Eli took another breath in as it realized just how much it had been missing. Just how much it had never realized it didn't have, how much it never would have known it wanted at all. Jude continued to watch quietly, letting it adjust as the sandy substance continued to sift through its fingers.</p>\n<p>Then it twitched a finger. One, then two, then it clenched all five into a fist. It was a strange feeling, to control a limb it had never had before, but the feeling came naturally. Most likely, it was part of the ritual, as breathing had come just as naturally. Eli extended its fingers, letting the rest of the debris fall to the floor, the grains filtering through the threads and all but disappearing.</p>\n<p>It reached up and out, shakily, towards Jude. It wanted to feel his hands, to feel another person's, its friend's, skin against its own. Jude understood what it was doing and closed the distance, slowly touching his fingers to Eli's. It pulled back at first, but then took Jude's hand in its, running its fingers over his rough skin.</p>\n<p>\"How is it?\" Jude asked, speaking softly as he let Eli caress his hand. It took another breath.</p>\n<p>\"It\u2026\" PIC's voice was a bit strained, though that was likely from Eli's inexperience in speaking with a physical voice. Jude leaned in, listening intently. The damp scent from earlier was stronger, and it felt its facial muscles contract. \"Stinks.\" Jude laughed at that, leaning back again.</p>\n<p>\"Sorry. I was smoking when PIC asked me to come over. Speaking of\u2026\" Jude let go of Eli's hand, reaching into the pocket of his hoodie. He pulled out a small object, one that Eli recognized as a joint.</p>\n<p>\"He asked me to bring one so I could offer it to you.\" Jude smiled, and Eli felt its chest grow warmer. It knew it felt happy, and it knew that people described happiness as feeling \"warm and fuzzy\", so it knew that must be what it was feeling. It was nice.</p>\n<p>\"I'm\u2026not sure.\" Eli had heard some of the others describe their difficulties the first time they smoked, and having never had a body before, it didn't feel comfortable smoking.</p>\n<p>\"That's cool.\" Jude put the joint back in his pocket. \"I figured you'd say no anyways.\"</p>\n<p>Eli and Jude sat in silence for a moment. It was nice. It ran its hands over the soft fabric of its jacket, the rough shag of the carpet, the stiff denim of its pants. It all felt so nice. It listened to the birds sing outside, and the fan buzz from its spot on the floor. It smelled the soft, flowery scent again.</p>\n<p>\"What's that smell?\" Eli couldn't see a flower anywhere in the room. Jude raised an eyebrow, and it clarified, \"Not the weed.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, this?\" Jude picked up a small glass jar, turning it slightly to show the wax and lit wick inside. A candle. \"I asked JJ what kind of scent I should get. Lucky guess?\"</p>\n<p>Eli took the candle in its hands. The glass was hot, but not hot enough to burn. It held the candle close enough for the flame's heat to radiate onto its face and sniffed deeply. The scent was much stronger this close, but it was just as soft and comforting, enveloping its mind in the same plush feeling as the jacket.</p>\n<p>Jude didn't interrupt. The moment lasted a long while, with Eli content to smell the scent of flowers, something it had wanted to do for so long. Only once the candle became too hot to hold did it put it back onto the floor. The sandy substance from earlier was still in the carpet.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you.\" Eli spoke up after an extended, but comfortable, silence.</p>\n<p>\"No problem,\" Jude said, waving his hand dismissively. \"But if you want to thank someone, thank PIC. He came up with the idea, and had the book.\"</p>\n<p>\"I will do that.\" Eli did its best to smile, an effort which Jude reciprocated with one of his own. The pair spent the rest of the time given by the ritual in silence, neither feeling a need to say anything, giving Eli the chance to fully focus on the sensory experiences before they faded away, and it was back behind Earth's Luna, in the vast expanse of space.</p>\n<p>It felt a bit colder now.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:1.5em;\">Private Chat: bones, <span style=\"color: #316afa\">polaricecraps</span></span></strong></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #316afa\">polaricecraps:</span></strong> how was it bones?<br/>\n<strong>bones:</strong> I liked it.

It had expected the ritual to snap it into PIC's body instantaneously, but it had instead happened slowly, a fade from its place behind Earth's Luna to a body of flesh and blood, of sinew and bone.\n\n\n\nThe first sense to come was sight, but PIC had closed his eyes, so there wasn't much to see just yet.\n\n\n\nThe second was hearing. Eli heard the buzz of a desk fan somewhere to its left. It heard the chirping of birds outside, dampened by a closed window. It heard someone, presumably Jude, move slightly. His clothes rubbed against a carpet, creating a scratchy sort of sound. Every sound was so much more noticeable, so much //more//, with human ears to catch them.\n\n\n\nThe third sense was feeling. A slight wind passed by it, likely the fan oscillating. The air ruffled its sleeve, rubbing the plush fabric against PIC's arm- its arm, for now. A silky substance passed through its fingers, falling to the floor. It felt like what Eli imagined sand to feel like. The air in the room was wet and heavy, something it didn't know air could be.\n\n\n\nIt took a breath in. The fourth sense was scent. There were only two distinct scents Eli could put words to, the rest a muddled, warm musk. A soft scent cut through it first, something misty and comforting. It reminded it of how its friend Lily described the scents of flowers. The other scent was much fainter, but it was there. Something much more damp and pungent, that reminded it of what swamps and marshes look like.\n\n\n\nThe last was taste. There wasn't much there, as Eli wasn't eating anything, but there was a slight pang on its tongue. PIC had probably eaten something sour or spicy, going off of what it knew of how its friends described those tastes.\n\n\n\nEli opened its eyes, taking in the room. It was bare, with nothing notable in its view. Jude was directly across from it, watching it as it took long, deep breaths, adjusting to now having lungs and hands and a human body, at least for now.\n\n\n\nThere was a difference, it now fully understood, in how it saw the world compared to how humans did. It had seen pictures of Jude, but with him sitting in front of it, it could see details it had never noticed before. His sclerae were tinted red, irritation from smoking marijuana. His hair was dry and thin, hidden under a large grey ushanka. There was a small stain on the front of his hoodie, one knee of his jeans was torn with threads stretched across, his socks were dirty with sweat.\n\n\n\nEli took another breath in as it realized just how much it had been missing. Just how much it had never realized it didn't have, how much it never would have known it wanted at all. Jude continued to watch quietly, letting it adjust as the sandy substance continued to sift through its fingers.\n\n\n\nThen it twitched a finger. One, then two, then it clenched all five into a fist. It was a strange feeling, to control a limb it had never had before, but the feeling came naturally.

Eli extended its fingers, letting the rest of the debris fall to the floor, the grains filtering through the threads and all but disappearing.\n\n\n\nIt reached up and out, shakily, towards Jude. It wanted to feel his hands, to feel another person's, its friend's, skin against its own. Jude understood what it was doing and closed the distance, slowly touching his fingers to Eli's. It pulled back at first, but then took Jude's hand in its, running its fingers over his rough skin.\n\n\n\n\"How is it?\" Jude asked, speaking softly as he let Eli caress his hand. It took another breath.\n\n\n\n\"It...\" PIC's voice was a bit strained, though that was likely from Eli's inexperience in speaking with a physical voice. Jude leaned in, listening intently. The damp scent from earlier was stronger, and it felt its facial muscles contract. \"Stinks.\" Jude laughed at that, leaning back again.\n\n\n\n\"Sorry. I was smoking when PIC asked me to come over. Speaking of...\" Jude let go of Eli's hand, reaching into the pocket of his hoodie.

It was nice. It ran its hands over the soft fabric of its jacket, the rough shag of the carpet, the stiff denim of its pants. It all felt so nice. It listened to the birds sing outside, and the fan buzz from its spot on the floor. It smelled the soft, flowery scent again.\n\n\n\n\"What's that smell?\" Eli couldn't see a flower anywhere in the room.

There\u2019s something almost beautiful about watching the fires from a distance. Clef knows he\u2019ll soon be burning too, but at least he can enjoy the view until then.</p>\n<p>Adams is dead, killed on an Alpha-9 mission, <em>so Clef is told</em>. And Draven\u2026 He never did find out where the kid went. It isn\u2019t important anymore, they were always disposable assets to the Foundation. Clef considers them lucky, at least they got out of here. Clef\u2019s seeing this shipwreck to the end.</p>\n<p>\"O5-12 has arrived to see you,\" his new assistant informs.</p>\n<p>\"Tell him to fuck off,\" Clef says.</p>\n<p>\"Sending him in now,\" his assistant replies.</p>\n<p>It really is beautiful out. He should be doing something about this but\u2026 he\u2019s so tired. He\u2019s been tired for as long as he can remember.</p>\n<p>Twelve enters alone.</p>\n<p>Clef doesn't bother turning around to greet him. \"So what the hell do you want?\"</p>\n<p>\"Is this how you talk to all the O5s?\" <em>Hey wait-</em></p>\n<p>Clef turns around, narrowing his eyes at Twelve. \u201cOh, it\u2019s you\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>O5-12, who was once a man named Troy Lament, smiles. It doesn\u2019t quite reach his eyes, it never did. The world is ending, and some aren\u2019t seeing the big finale. The list is handwritten.</p>\n<p>Right there, on the bottom of the list. It couldn\u2019t be an accident.</p>\n<p>\"Your people fucked up here. Kondraki's been dead over a decade. Someone\u2026 shot him in the head.\"</p>\n<p>Twelve just smiles.</p>\n<p><em>They knew. All of them knew, they always did. They always fucking did</em>.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\"><span style=\"color:#990000;\">Andrews Bjornsen</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\"><span style=\"color:#990000;\">Karlyle Aktus</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\"><span style=\"color:#990000;\">Kate McTiriss</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\"><span style=\"color:#990000;\">Zyn Kiryu</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\"><span style=\"color:#990000;\">Ralph Roget</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\"><span style=\"color:#990000;\">Avery Solace</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\"><span style=\"color:#990000;\">Rose Labelle</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\"><span style=\"color:#990000;\">Quikngruvn Halifax</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\"><span style=\"color:#990000;\">Maria Jones</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\"><span style=\"color:#990000;\">Chelsea Elliott</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\"><span style=\"color:#990000;\">Simon Glass</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\"><span style=\"color:#990000;\">Django Bridge</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\"><span style=\"color:#990000;\">Everett Mann</span></span></p>\n<p>They\u2019re all just names. Maybe some of them used to be friends. Doesn\u2019t matter anymore.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a gap in the list, a notable space between Everett Mann and Kain Pathos Crow. It\u2019s a strange placement for a gap, standing out among the closely knit scribbled names. Charles Gears is supposed to go there, but of course, Nobody knows who Charles Gears is anymore.</p>\n<p>Nobody is sitting in the director\u2019s office. He looks like how Clef feels, if maybe a bit cleaner. A gun sits on the desk beside him. Clef freezes in the doorway.</p>\n<p>Nobody doesn\u2019t look at him, the only sound is the soft scratch of pen to paper and the distant roar of the end of the world. It\u2019s almost serene, he could get lost in this moment. Part of him has already been lost in his moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to hesitate,\u201d says Nobody. He says it so casually. Clef looks him in the eyes and sees the flickering reflection of light pouring in through the window.</p>\n<p>\"I realize you are here to carry out my scheduled execution. My affairs are in order. I have done the same for Doctor Crow. I would have carried out the deed myself, but I was informed the process needed to be executed either directly or indirectly by you.\"</p>\n<p>Clef chuckles, he\u2019s not sure at what specifically. Maybe it\u2019s how he says the word <em>execution. Execution</em>, like Clef is some sort of revolutionaire, and not a trained attack dog.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that it?\u201d Clef isn\u2019t sure who he\u2019s asking. Of <em>course</em> that\u2019s it. He kills Nobody, the O5s smash the big red reset button, nothing Clef has gone through for the past\u2026 nothing before or after this moment will have ever mattered.</p>\n<p>Nobody nudges the pistol towards Clef. Clef wonders, vaguely, if it\u2019s the same gun he used on Kondraki. It probably isn\u2019t, but the thought crosses his mind. He approaches the desk in the manner of someone approaching a rotted corpse.</p>\n<p>\u201cI would have liked to do more to help cover your tracks, but\u2026\u201d Nobody trails off, eyes drifting from Clef to the floor. He slides open a drawer and holds out a package. \u201cThe coordinates for the current location of Dr. Kondraki.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cHow long\u2026\u201d Clef decides not to finish that question, it wouldn\u2019t make him feel better. He stares at the package for several long moments before taking it. It doesn\u2019t feel real, but then again, what does?</p>\n<p>\"I do have a last request.\" He stands and presses a vial into Clef\u2019s hand. \u201cFor Kain\u2026 It\u2019ll make his death quick and happy. I\u2026 he left a note for you in his office.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"I've already put him into a coma\u2026\u201d Nobody winces. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t want you to have to see him when you did this. His body is in a closed kennel with an IV hook up. You need only insert this into the IV.\"</p>\n<p>Clef stares at him, Nobody stares back. Both fail to find their words.</p>\n<p>Clef puts the vial and package in his pockets. He looks around, surveying the neat office space. It\u2019s almost completely empty, as clean as a well used room could be. Everything exactly in its place.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you happy like this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I asked.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nobody doesn\u2019t say a word. Clef sighs.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome get a drink with me,\u201d he says, very suddenly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome get a drink with me,\u201d Clef repeats.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026 can\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not? The world\u2019s on fire, everyone\u2019s gonna be fucking dead in like two weeks, either I shoot you now or I do it later. There\u2019s nothing left for us here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you want\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve made my <em>wants</em> as clear as possible.\u201d</p>\n<p>Another silence, followed by floorboards creaking as Nobody steps towards him. Clef nods, once, and they leave Site-19 together.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>The streets are empty, even the veiled citizens can sense the end times. Perfectly fine by Clef. His truck takes several tries to start up, and he cruises through the ghost town with Nobody in the passenger\u2019s seat.</p>\n<p><em>The Bitter End</em>\u2019s neon sign hasn\u2019t worked for years, it only occasionally offers a few disjointed flickers. The lights are on, but no one\u2019s inside. Clef takes out Nobody\u2019s pistol, sticks a bullet in the lock, and kicks the front door open. It looks like the aftermath of a riot, the floor hidden under a layer of grime.</p>\n<p>Clef hops over the bar, finding two unbroken bottles of beer. He pulls off the caps with his teeth and hands one to Nobody. Nobody looks like he\u2019s never held a bottle in his life. Clef smacks them together in a mock toast and they both drink.</p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t you gonna say something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have no lines left\u2026\u201d The script has ended, he was supposed to die back in his office.</p>\n<p>Come on\u2026\u201d his voice verges on desperation.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what you want from me anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>I hate you,</em> Clef does not say. <em>You hurt me,</em> he doesn\u2019t say that either. <em>Something changed, you slipped through my fingers and I don\u2019t even know when,</em> he would never say. <em>I miss you,</em> he feels echo around the hole where his heart once sat. <em>I love you</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d he finally settles on. \u201cI\u2019ve <em>been</em> tired for so, so, so <em>fucking</em> long. Before you, before\u2026 before Konny, before the Foundation. I\u2019m just\u2026 so tired.\u201d He puts his face in his hands and chuckles, a scratchy, broken sound.</p>\n<p>Nobody shifts. \u201cSeems\u2026 fitting things end here. Right where things began.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid things begin here? \u2026 That\u2019s funny actually, I like a good full circle.\u201d He leans in, resting his head against Nobody\u2019s chest. \u201cThe Bitter End, hehehe, I just thought about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nobody rests his hand on the back of Clef\u2019s head, like Clef is some sort of dog. Not a bad feeling. Nobody can only stare off into the distance.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid we\u2026 deserve this?\u201d Clef asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cWould it be easier if we did?\u201d</p>\n<p>The stool squeaks as Clef straightens out. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Aren\u2019t you supposed to know things in the end? Isn\u2019t there supposed to be closure?\u201d</p>\n<p>Nobody opens his mouth, only to be cut off by Clef jamming their faces together. He leans back, propping himself up with the countertop. It\u2019s not a good kiss, but it\u2019s an eager one, and Nobody matches the desperation.</p>\n<p>For the full minute the kiss lasts, Clef can forget everything. If nothing will ever matter again, then Clef can stay in this moment. The world can end tomorrow for all he cares.</p>\n<p>He pulls back and observes the dusting on pink on Nobody\u2019s cheeks. Neither moves, neither dares to. Just as quickly, the trance slips, and Clef remembers what he has to do.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have to end like this.\u201d He drags his knuckles against the side of Nobody\u2019s face. Nobody closes his eyes, for a moment gone from this world.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was always going to end like this,\u201d he says, distantly. \u201cThe end was the first thing written.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef snorts. \u201cFeeling poetic tonight, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve had\u2026 quite a bit of time to contemplate this\u2026 contemplate everything I did\u2026 you have every right to still be mad with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was never\u2026 <em>augh</em>, I was never mad at you. I thought I was, I thought I was <em>so</em> fucking angry, but it was never you.\u201d He laughs, wiping away the few tears at the corners of his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll give you one thing, you fucked me up <em>bad</em>, but I think I fucked you up too\u2026 I guess we\u2019ll know better for next time, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>Nobody tilts his head to one side and nods slowly. \u201cNext time\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>As the same thought passes through both minds, they stand up, abandoning their drinks.</p>\n<p>\u201cGoodbye\u2026 Charles.\u201d Clef stands on his tiptoes to peck him on the lips. \"You were the best of us.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cGoodbye, doctor. It has been a pleasure.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>A pleasure\u2026</em> yeah right.</p>\n<p>Clef lets himself believe it.</p>\n<p>And then he pulls the trigger.</p>\n<p>Gears hits the ground, the death nearly instant. Clef may be shaky, but he knows his stuff.</p>\n<p>He turns the lights off on the way out.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>When Clef steps into Gears\u2019s <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span>, the door creaks, echoing through long and empty halls. His footsteps kick up a layer of dust. It\u2019s been a long time since anyone has lived here.</p>\n<p>He finds a corner in the kitchen and has a seat, resting his head against the cabinets. He lets his eyes close, the sound the <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span> washes over him. A wind passes by, causing the front door to sway.</p>\n<p><em>What is he waiting for?</em> He asks himself. He\u2019s not sure why he thought there would be something here for him. It\u2019s just a <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span>. <em>Just a <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span></em>\u2026 Its only companion dead.</p>\n<p><em>Right</em>, he had another reason to come here. He stands up and returns to his truck. Four tanks of gasoline wait for him. He grabs one and begins making a slow, and methodical circle around the house.</p>\n<p>He pours a tank on the floor, splashes the wall, until he\u2019s emptied all four tanks and he\u2019s sure every inch is soaked. The <span style=\"color:#0099ff;\">house</span> makes no sign of protest, even as Clef steps outside and pulls out his lighter.</p>\n<p>The fire can be seen from Site-19, but no one\u2019s ever lived in that place, so they pay it no mind. More important work to be done.</p>\n<p>If Clef can do one thing right, he hopes he helped his friend to rest.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>The bus driver gives him an odd look as Clef explains where he wants to be dropped off. Maybe it\u2019s because it\u2019s the middle of nowhere, maybe it\u2019s because Clef is covered in blood and vomit and is carrying a shotgun. It\u2019s well past midnight by the time they stop. Clef is the only one on board. He tips his hat to the driver on his way off, only polite.</p>\n<p>A cold breeze brushes past, it feels nice against his too warm face. He closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and holds it. The bus drives off behind him, the crickets chirp, a moth <em>tap tap taps</em> against the light overhead. Gears\u2019s pistol in his pocket, one bullet in his shotgun, one last confrontation to be had.</p>\n<p>Clef observes the shack from a distance. It\u2019s small, cozy even, surrounded by forest. It was quite a walk from here to the nearest road. Exactly the sort of place Kondraki would love. It hurts to look at.</p>\n<p>Clef steps into the clearing <em>and he\u2019s sitting in a fold-out chair before a lake, watching how the moon\u2019s reflection ripples across the peaceful surface. At the hissing sound of a beer can, Clef glances at Kondraki. Kondraki licks the foam off his hands and the side of the can, looking stupid while doing so. Clef sips at his drink.</em></p>\n<p><em>Kondraki scoots his chair a little closer to Clef. They lean against each other. Neither says a word, afraid to break the strange peace that\u2019s passed over both of them. Clef doesn\u2019t think about how vulnerable he feels right now.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cClef?\u201d Kondraki\u2019s breath stinks of beer.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cHm?\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201c\u2018M tired\u2026\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>Clef glances at Kondraki\u2019s watch. They\u2019re both up far too late. He looks around, taking mental note of all of the crushed up cans they\u2019ve left on the ground. Kondraki\u2019s eyes are closed, he looks a million miles away.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cOkay,\u201d Clef says, getting to his feet with some effort, \u201cthat\u2019s enough, let\u2019s get you home.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>Kondraki mumbles something as Clef tugs him to his feet. They stumble along in tandem, both of them dragging their chairs behind them. They pack up in Clef\u2019s truck, Clef lets the heater warm up before he drives.</em></p>\n<p><em>Clef\u2019s cabin is right next to their lake shore drinking spot. Clef thinks about driving Kondraki all the way home and back and feels a headache coming on. He pulls up into his driveway and nudges Kondraki awake.</em></p>\n<p><em>Little Shit excitedly scrambles up to Kondraki, barrelling face first into his shin. He leans down to pet its head, ruffling up its greasy fur.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cMeow!\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cMerow?\u201d Kondraki replies inquisitively.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cMow!\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>In Clef\u2019s bedroom, they both make a pile of clothes on the floor and crawl into bed. The bed is hardly appropriate for two full grown men, but they make it work. Little Shit hops into bed and curls up between them, like a child crawling into bed with their parents.</em></p>\n<p><em>Kondraki leans in and pecks Clef on the lips. Clef is almost embarrassed by how chaste it is. Stupidly tender.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cHey Clef?

THERE'S NO ONE AROUND AND YOUR PHONE IS DEAD. OUT OF THE CORNER OF YOUR EYE YOU SPOT HIM-\u201d</p>\n<p>A whisper: <em>\u201cTroy Lament.\u201d</em> It\u2019s Kondraki\u2019s voice.</p>\n<p>Clef violently flinches. He puts his hand over his heart. What an <em>absurd</em> thing to potentially kill him. He stares in disbelief for several minutes, stunned to silence.</p>\n<p>The front door of the shack hangs wide open, like the mouth of an animal. Surely Clef should feel relieved, Kondraki\u2019s not an idiot, he\u2019s long gone, and Clef doesn\u2019t have to do this.</p>\n<p>A twitch in the shadows. So small he could have ignored it, could have told himself he didn\u2019t see it. He could have walked away fully believing that Kondraki had left and that he wouldn\u2019t be able to finish him off.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cOh, and now I'm going to believe a word that comes out of that polymorphic pie hole?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Clef grits his teeth. He\u2019s too close to this to ever let it go, there was no other way for this to end. He swallows down his nausea and steps inside.</p>\n<p>The shadow moves quickly; Kondraki steps into the light, ripping Clef\u2019s shotgun out of his hands.</p>\n<p>\"Sit the fuck down!\" He barks, and then, immediately- \"You're not Lament.\"</p>\n<p><em>Oh God</em>, Clef feels like the wind has been forced out of him. Kondraki stands tall, casting a shadow over Clef. A billion words rush into his mind, none escape his lips. Kondraki shifts uncomfortably.</p>\n<p>He leans over the flick off the radio. \"They sent <em>you</em>? Didn't think they'd have the balls. Figured it would be Lament. Best agent they actually consider expendable\u2026 you\u2019ve\u2026 still got my coat.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking well, Kon,\u201d Clef forces out. Kondraki gives him an odd look. Clef already looks like total shit, like a man who's been dragged unconscious through a sewer, he probably sounds like shit too, not that he can hear much over the roar of his own blood.</p>\n<p>\"Keeping healthy,\" Kondraki says. \"Hunt and gather. Strict workout regimen.\" He pats his stomach. \"Important for living on the run. Gotta stay healthy. Always.\" He frowns, brows furrowed. \"You let me take your gun.\"</p>\n<p>His eyes flick between Kondraki\u2019s face and his shotgun. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef shrugs.</p>\n<p>A bird claws in the distance. A river flows. The cracks in the sky get a little wider. The moon dips below the horizon. Kondraki sighs.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were dead,\u201d Clef says, like Kondraki is an idiot. \u201cShot in the head. I saw your funeral. I filled your goddamn corpse full of lead!\u201d Clef clutches his stomach, breaking out in a cold sweat. He trembles, he hates how he can\u2019t control his own body.</p>\n<p>\"I heard,\" Kondraki says, having the gaul to sound ashamed of himself. \"Hear tell you missed most of the shots, too. Just like you.\" He laughs without humor. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHad to be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, why are you <em>here?</em> I know you, <em>I know you</em>. You'd have never fallen for a trick like that, not in a million years.\" Kondraki takes a step forward, Clef takes a step back.</p>\n<p>\u201cGuess I\u2019m just tired.\u201d Clef looks like someone who\u2019s <em>more</em> than just tired, he looks empty.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you?\u201d Kondraki sets Clef\u2019s shotgun down. \u201cThis isn\u2019t like you. Normally you\u2019d be all up in arms. Where\u2019s your bite? You\u2019re acting like-\u201d Kondraki squints. \u201cYou\u2019re acting just like\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Clef starts to laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know who you want to compare to me!\u201d Clef cackles, tears pouring down his face. He gasps sharply, his lungs burning with the effort. Kondraki backs up, face twisting into cold terror, though Clef can\u2019t imagine what\u2019s wrong. The walls creak and pull inwards, pushing Kondraki closer and closer to the center.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have <em>no</em> idea what I\u2019ve been through!\u201d Clef screams. The walls crack, blood and mold and filthy water pools on the floor. \u201cYou don\u2019t know who I am! What I\u2019ve lost! You don\u2019t even know what <em>you\u2019ve</em> lost!

Clef freezes in the doorway. \n\n\n\nNobody doesn\u2019t look at him, the only sound is the soft scratch of pen to paper and the distant roar of the end of the world. It\u2019s almost serene, he could get lost in this moment. Part of him has already been lost in his moment. \n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to hesitate,\u201d says Nobody. He says it so casually. Clef looks him in the eyes and sees the flickering reflection of light pouring in through the window.\n\n\n\n\"I realize you are here to carry out my scheduled execution. My affairs are in order. I have done the same for Doctor Crow. I would have carried out the deed myself, but I was informed the process needed to be executed either directly or indirectly by you.\"\n\n\n\nClef chuckles, he\u2019s not sure at what specifically. Maybe it\u2019s how he says the word //execution. Execution//, like Clef is some sort of revolutionaire, and not a trained attack dog. \n\n\n\n\u201cIs that it?\u201d Clef isn\u2019t sure who he\u2019s asking. Of //course// that\u2019s it. He kills Nobody, the O5s smash the big red reset button, nothing Clef has gone through for the past\u2026 nothing before or after this moment will have ever mattered. \n\n\n\nNobody nudges the pistol towards Clef. Clef wonders, vaguely, if it\u2019s the same gun he used on Kondraki. It probably isn\u2019t, but the thought crosses his mind. He approaches the desk in the manner of someone approaching a rotted corpse. \n\n\n\n\u201cI would have liked to do more to help cover your tracks, but\u2026\u201d Nobody trails off, eyes drifting from Clef to the floor. He slides open a drawer and holds out a package. \u201cThe coordinates for the current location of Dr. Kondraki.\"\n\n\n\n\u201cHow long\u2026\u201d Clef decides not to finish that question, it wouldn\u2019t make him feel better. He stares at the package for several long moments before taking it. It doesn\u2019t feel real, but then again, what does? \n\n\n\n\"I do have a last request.\" He stands and presses a vial into Clef\u2019s hand. \u201cFor Kain\u2026 It\u2019ll make his death quick and happy. I\u2026 he left a note for you in his office.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d \n\n\n\n\"I've already put him into a coma\u2026\u201d Nobody winces. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t want you to have to see him when you did this. His body is in a closed kennel with an IV hook up. You need only insert this into the IV.\"\n\n\n\nClef stares at him, Nobody stares back. Both fail to find their words.\n\n\n\nClef puts the vial and package in his pockets. He looks around, surveying the neat office space. It\u2019s almost completely empty, as clean as a well used room could be. Everything exactly in its place.\n\n\n\n\u201cAre you happy like this?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I asked.\u201d \n\n\n\nNobody doesn\u2019t say a word. Clef sighs. \n\n\n\n\u201cCome get a drink with me,\u201d he says, very suddenly.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cCome get a drink with me,\u201d Clef repeats. \n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2026 can\u2019t.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cWhy not? The world\u2019s on fire, everyone\u2019s gonna be fucking dead in like two weeks, either I shoot you now or I do it later. There\u2019s nothing left for us here.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you want\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve made my //wants// as clear as possible.\u201d \n\n\n\nAnother silence, followed by floorboards creaking as Nobody steps towards him. Clef nods, once, and they leave Site-19 together. \n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\nThe streets are empty, even the veiled citizens can sense the end times. Perfectly fine by Clef. His truck takes several tries to start up, and he cruises through the ghost town with Nobody in the passenger\u2019s seat. \n\n\n\n//The Bitter End//\u2019s neon sign hasn\u2019t worked for years, it only occasionally offers a few disjointed flickers. The lights are on, but no one\u2019s inside. Clef takes out Nobody\u2019s pistol, sticks a bullet in the lock, and kicks the front door open. It looks like the aftermath of a riot, the floor hidden under a layer of grime. \n\n\n\nClef hops over the bar, finding two unbroken bottles of beer. He pulls off the caps with his teeth and hands one to Nobody. Nobody looks like he\u2019s never held a bottle in his life. Clef smacks them together in a mock toast and they both drink. \n\n\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t you gonna say something?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI have no lines left\u2026\u201d The script has ended, he was supposed to die back in his office. \n\n\n\nCome on\u2026\u201d his voice verges on desperation. \n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what you want from me anymore.\u201d \n\n\n\n//I hate you,// Clef does not say. //You hurt me,// he doesn\u2019t say that either. //Something changed, you slipped through my fingers and I don\u2019t even know when,// he would never say. //I miss you,// he feels echo around the hole where his heart once sat. //I love you//.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d he finally settles on. \u201cI\u2019ve //been// tired for so, so, so //fucking// long. Before you, before\u2026 before Konny, before the Foundation. I\u2019m just\u2026 so tired.\u201d He puts his face in his hands and chuckles, a scratchy, broken sound.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nNobody shifts. \u201cSeems\u2026 fitting things end here. Right where things began.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cDid things begin here? \u2026 That\u2019s funny actually, I like a good full circle.\u201d He leans in, resting his head against Nobody\u2019s chest. \u201cThe Bitter End, hehehe, I just thought about it.\u201d \n\n\n\nNobody rests his hand on the back of Clef\u2019s head, like Clef is some sort of dog. Not a bad feeling. Nobody can only stare off into the distance. \n\n\n\n\u201cDid we\u2026 deserve this?\u201d Clef asks. \n\n\n\n\u201cWould it be easier if we did?\u201d \n\n\n\nThe stool squeaks as Clef straightens out. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Aren\u2019t you supposed to know things in the end? Isn\u2019t there supposed to be closure?\u201d \n\n\n\nNobody opens his mouth, only to be cut off by Clef jamming their faces together. He leans back, propping himself up with the countertop. It\u2019s not a good kiss, but it\u2019s an eager one, and Nobody matches the desperation. \n\n\n\nFor the full minute the kiss lasts, Clef can forget everything. If nothing will ever matter again, then Clef can stay in this moment. The world can end tomorrow for all he cares. \n\n\n\n\u00a0He pulls back and observes the dusting on pink on Nobody\u2019s cheeks. Neither moves, neither dares to. Just as quickly, the trance slips, and Clef remembers what he has to do. \n\n\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have to end like this.\u201d He drags his knuckles against the side of Nobody\u2019s face. Nobody closes his eyes, for a moment gone from this world. \n\n\n\n\u201cIt was always going to end like this,\u201d he says, distantly. \u201cThe end was the first thing written.\u201d \n\n\n\nClef snorts. \u201cFeeling poetic tonight, aren\u2019t we?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had\u2026 quite a bit of time to contemplate this\u2026 contemplate everything I did\u2026 you have every right to still be mad with me.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cI was never\u2026 //augh//, I was never mad at you. I thought I was, I thought I was //so// fucking angry, but it was never you.\u201d He laughs, wiping away the few tears at the corners of his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll give you one thing, you fucked me up //bad//, but I think I fucked you up too\u2026 I guess we\u2019ll know better for next time, huh?\u201d \n\n\n\nNobody tilts his head to one side and nods slowly. \u201cNext time\u2026\u201d \n\n\n\nAs the same thought passes through both minds, they stand up, abandoning their drinks. \n\n\n\n\u201cGoodbye\u2026 Charles.\u201d Clef stands on his tiptoes to peck him on the lips. \"You were the best of us.\"\n\n\n\n\u201cGoodbye, doctor. It has been a pleasure.\u201d \n\n\n\n//A pleasure\u2026// yeah right. \n\n\n\nClef lets himself believe it. \n\n\n\nAnd then he pulls the trigger. \n\n\n\nGears hits the ground, the death nearly instant. Clef may be shaky, but he knows his stuff. \n\n\n\nHe turns the lights off on the way out. \n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\nWhen Clef steps into Gears\u2019s [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]], the door creaks, echoing through long and empty halls. His footsteps kick up a layer of dust. It\u2019s been a long time since anyone has lived here. \n\n\n\nHe finds a corner in the kitchen and has a seat, resting his head against the cabinets. He lets his eyes close, the sound the [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]] washes over him. A wind passes by, causing the front door to sway.\n\n\n\n//What is he waiting for?// He asks himself. He\u2019s not sure why he thought there would be something here for him. It\u2019s just a [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]]. //Just a [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]]//... Its only companion dead. \n\n\n\n//Right//, he had another reason to come here. He stands up and returns to his truck. Four tanks of gasoline wait for him. He grabs one and begins making a slow, and methodical circle around the house.\n\n\n\nHe pours a tank on the floor, splashes the wall, until he\u2019s emptied all four tanks and he\u2019s sure every inch is soaked. The [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]] makes no sign of protest, even as Clef steps outside and pulls out his lighter. \n\n\n\nThe fire can be seen from Site-19, but no one\u2019s ever lived in that place, so they pay it no mind. More important work to be done. \n\n\n\nIf Clef can do one thing right, he hopes he helped his friend to rest. \n\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n\nThe bus driver gives him an odd look as Clef explains where he wants to be dropped off. Maybe it\u2019s because it\u2019s the middle of nowhere, maybe it\u2019s because Clef is covered in blood and vomit and is carrying a shotgun. It\u2019s well past midnight by the time they stop. Clef is the only one on board. He tips his hat to the driver on his way off, only polite.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nA cold breeze brushes past, it feels nice against his too warm face. He closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and holds it. The bus drives off behind him, the crickets chirp, a moth //tap tap taps// against the light overhead. Gears\u2019s pistol in his pocket, one bullet in his shotgun, one last confrontation to be had. \n\n\n\nClef observes the shack from a distance. It\u2019s small, cozy even, surrounded by forest. It was quite a walk from here to the nearest road. Exactly the sort of place Kondraki would love. It hurts to look at. \n\n\n\nClef steps into the clearing //and he\u2019s sitting in a fold-out chair before a lake, watching how the moon\u2019s reflection ripples across the peaceful surface. At the hissing sound of a beer can, Clef glances at Kondraki. Kondraki licks the foam off his hands and the side of the can, looking stupid while doing so. Clef sips at his drink.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//Kondraki scoots his chair a little closer to Clef. They lean against each other. Neither says a word, afraid to break the strange peace that\u2019s passed over both of them. Clef doesn\u2019t think about how vulnerable he feels right now.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cClef?\u201d Kondraki\u2019s breath stinks of beer.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cHm?\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201c\u2018M tired\u2026\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//Clef glances at Kondraki\u2019s watch. They\u2019re both up far too late. He looks around, taking mental note of all of the crushed up cans they\u2019ve left on the ground. Kondraki\u2019s eyes are closed, he looks a million miles away.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cOkay,\u201d Clef says, getting to his feet with some effort, \u201cthat\u2019s enough, let\u2019s get you home.\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//Kondraki mumbles something as Clef tugs him to his feet. They stumble along in tandem, both of them dragging their chairs behind them. They pack up in Clef\u2019s truck, Clef lets the heater warm up before he drives.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//Clef\u2019s cabin is right next to their lake shore drinking spot. Clef thinks about driving Kondraki all the way home and back and feels a headache coming on. He pulls up into his driveway and nudges Kondraki awake.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//Little Shit excitedly scrambles up to Kondraki, barrelling face first into his shin. He leans down to pet its head, ruffling up its greasy fur.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cMeow!\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cMerow?\u201d Kondraki replies inquisitively.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cMow!\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//In Clef\u2019s bedroom, they both make a pile of clothes on the floor and crawl into bed. The bed is hardly appropriate for two full grown men, but they make it work. Little Shit hops into bed and curls up between them, like a child crawling into bed with their parents.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//Kondraki leans in and pecks Clef on the lips. Clef is almost embarrassed by how chaste it is. Stupidly tender.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cHey Clef? What are we?\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//Clef chokes on nothing. \u201cWhat kinda stupid ass question is that?\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cI think it\u2019s a perfectly reasonable question!\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//Clef scoffs and rolls his eyes. \u201cWhat do you want us to be?\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cNow who\u2019s asking stupid questions!\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//A beat passes.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cIf I say something real sappy will it kill the mood?\u201d Kondraki whispers. \u201cBecause I think I-\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\n\"YOU'RE WALKING IN THE WOODS. THERE'S NO ONE AROUND AND YOUR PHONE IS DEAD. OUT OF THE CORNER OF YOUR EYE YOU SPOT HIM-\u201d \n\n\n\nA whisper: //\u201cTroy Lament.\u201d// It\u2019s Kondraki\u2019s voice. \n\n\n\nClef violently flinches. He puts his hand over his heart. What an //absurd// thing to potentially kill him. He stares in disbelief for several minutes, stunned to silence. \n\n\n\nThe front door of the shack hangs wide open, like the mouth of an animal. Surely Clef should feel relieved, Kondraki\u2019s not an idiot, he\u2019s long gone, and Clef doesn\u2019t have to do this. \n\n\n\nA twitch in the shadows. So small he could have ignored it, could have told himself he didn\u2019t see it. He could have walked away fully believing that Kondraki had left and that he wouldn\u2019t be able to finish him off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cOh, and now I'm going to believe a word that comes out of that polymorphic pie hole?\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\nClef grits his teeth. He\u2019s too close to this to ever let it go, there was no other way for this to end. He swallows down his nausea and steps inside. \n\n\n\nThe shadow moves quickly; Kondraki steps into the light, ripping Clef\u2019s shotgun out of his hands. \n\n\n\n\"Sit the fuck down!\" He barks, and then, immediately- \"You're not Lament.\"\n\n\n\n//Oh God//, Clef feels like the wind has been forced out of him. Kondraki stands tall, casting a shadow over Clef. A billion words rush into his mind, none escape his lips. Kondraki shifts uncomfortably. \n\n\n\nHe leans over the flick off the radio. \"They sent //you//? Didn't think they'd have the balls. Figured it would be Lament. Best agent they actually consider expendable\u2026 you\u2019ve\u2026 still got my coat.\"\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking well, Kon,\u201d Clef forces out. Kondraki gives him an odd look. Clef already looks like total shit, like a man who's been dragged unconscious through a sewer, he probably sounds like shit too, not that he can hear much over the roar of his own blood. \n\n\n\n\"Keeping healthy,\" Kondraki says. \"Hunt and gather. Strict workout regimen.\" He pats his stomach. \"Important for living on the run. Gotta stay healthy. Always.\" He frowns, brows furrowed. \"You let me take your gun.\"\n\n\n\nHis eyes flick between Kondraki\u2019s face and his shotgun. \u201cYeah.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d \n\n\n\nClef shrugs.\n\n\n\nA bird claws in the distance. A river flows. The cracks in the sky get a little wider. The moon dips below the horizon. Kondraki sighs. \n\n\n\n\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou were dead,\u201d Clef says, like Kondraki is an idiot. \u201cShot in the head. I saw your funeral. I filled your goddamn corpse full of lead!\u201d Clef clutches his stomach, breaking out in a cold sweat. He trembles, he hates how he can\u2019t control his own body. \n\n\n\n\"I heard,\" Kondraki says, having the gaul to sound ashamed of himself. \"Hear tell you missed most of the shots, too. Just like you.\" He laughs without humor. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cHad to be.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cNo, why are you //here?// I know you, //I know you//. You'd have never fallen for a trick like that, not in a million years.\" Kondraki takes a step forward, Clef takes a step back. \n\n\n\n\u201cGuess I\u2019m just tired.\u201d Clef looks like someone who\u2019s //more// than just tired, he looks empty. \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you?\u201d Kondraki sets Clef\u2019s shotgun down. \u201cThis isn\u2019t like you. Normally you\u2019d be all up in arms. Where\u2019s your bite? You\u2019re acting like-\u201d Kondraki squints. \u201cYou\u2019re acting just like\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nClef starts to laugh. \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t even know who you want to compare to me!\u201d Clef cackles, tears pouring down his face. He gasps sharply, his lungs burning with the effort. Kondraki backs up, face twisting into cold terror, though Clef can\u2019t imagine what\u2019s wrong. The walls creak and pull inwards, pushing Kondraki closer and closer to the center. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou have //no// idea what I\u2019ve been through!\u201d Clef screams. The walls crack, blood and mold and filthy water pools on the floor. \u201cYou don\u2019t know who I am! What I\u2019ve lost! You don\u2019t even know what //you\u2019ve// lost!

He scrambles into a corner, hand over his too fast heart. He gasps, each quick breath felt like he was swallowing needles. His eyes dart around his shack. The walls aren\u2019t full of mold, everything is exactly as it should be. Clef lays on the floor, face obscured. \n\n\n\n\u201cHoly shit!\u201d He wheezes. Crawling on his hands and knees, and kneels by Clef\u2019s side. He rolls Clef over, gently brushing the back of his fingers against Clef\u2019s beard. Clef breathes slowly and does not open his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Kondraki whispers. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I left you.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201c\u2018M tired\u2026\u201d Clef mumbles, leaning into Kondraki\u2019s touch.

In two seconds, Clef whips out Gears\u2019s pistol and shoots him between the eyes, rendering him braindead.\n\n\n\n\"You should've put a bullet through my skull, Kon,\" he says, watching as the last twitches of life settle down. \"Why couldn't you just\u2026\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201c-love you.\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//Clef blanches. \u201cWhat?\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cDon\u2019t make me repeat it.\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//Clef snatches both sides of Kondraki\u2019s face. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cI love you?\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//\u201cYou\u2019re disgusting,\u201d Clef says, tears twinkling in his eyes.//\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0//Kondraki snorts. \u201cWe\u2019re disgusting, Clef.\u201d//\n\n\n\n\n\n//Clef sniffles grossly. \u201cGod, you\u2019re awful.

It doesn\u2019t hurt, it might even be comfortable under different circumstances.\n\n\n\n\"Sloppy of them,\" she says. \"Hello, Clef. My name is Sophia Light. You killed my ex-boyfriend. Prepare to die.\" She brandishes a thirteen inch chef\u2019s knife. \n\n\n\nHe forces out a snort at hurt reference. \u201cFitting\u2026 The final girl kills the monster at the end.\u201d He sighs, staring wistfully at the Bloom. \u201cI hate to end things like this but\u2026\u201d there\u2019s nothing left for him to say. \n\n\n\nShe grabs him by the shirt collar and lines up the tip of the knife with his windpipe. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou know that [[span style=\"color:#0099ff;\"]]house[[/span]] that\u2019s right next to SIte-19?\u201d He asks. \n\n\n\n\u201cThe one you burned down?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the one. Do me a favor and make sure nobody ever buys that place.\u201d \n\n\n\nShe nods as if she understands, and then she plunges the knife through his throat. \n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n[**Dr. Gears** (//as Gears//) steps into **Dr. Clef\u2019s** (//as Clef//) office, holding a ratty jacket]\n\n\n\n**Gears:** [Stiffly] \u201cHow are you feeling, Dr. Clef?\u201d \n\n\n\n**Clef:** [Manic] \u201cLike a million bucks!

Yours is the Will of a dead dream; mine is the Will of the future.</span></p>\n<hr/>\n<p>A loud crash of thunder woke Alan from his sleep. Rubbing his eyes, he looked out the window to his right. Pouring rain ran down the window as another loud crash of thunder rang out.</p>\n<p>\"We will be there in two minutes, Dr. Morgan,\" the driver stated, checking his watch.</p>\n<p>Alan nodded and looked back out the window. He didn't understand why he was specifically called for this assignment. He was a reality specialist; he couldn't fathom why the Foundation would have him drive out so quickly. Why was this so under wraps? <em>I didn't even know we had a site out here,</em> he thought as the car stopped.</p>\n<p>\"Alright, Doctor, we are here.\"</p>\n<p>Alan opened the car door to heavy, pouring rain. He flipped up his jacket as a makeshift umbrella and dashed to the front of the site. Standing before the illuminated door was a Foundation security agent with his hands on his waist.</p>\n<p>\"Welcome to Site Silver, Dr. Morgan. I hope your drive went well,\" the man said, reaching out to Alan.</p>\n<p>\"It was long, but no trouble,\" Alan responded as they headed indoors.</p>\n<p>\"My name is Agent Daughtry. I'm the head of Site Silver Security and Safety. How familiar are you with Project Tall-Tale?\" Daughtry asked as they walked down the hall.</p>\n<p>\"Not much. I'm not entirely sure why I was redirected to this site. Granted, I didn't know this site existed.\"</p>\n<p>\"Okay, yeah, this project has been held pretty tight under security so as not to freak out the entirety of the Foundation. Follow me, and I'll show you why you are here.\" Daughtry pointed to two large stealth doors.</p>\n<p>They approached the door; Agent Daughtry signaled to the cameras, and the large doors began to open. The sounds of heavy rain then once again filled the air. Alan put his hands over his face as they began to walk into the heavy downpour. All around him, he could see an unnatural amount of security personnel. Large mounted machine guns lined the tops of the walls, and about thirty armed personnel were around the large containment chamber.</p>\n<p>A large gust of wind made Alan stop for a second and look at the ground to avoid getting rain in his eyes. At that point, he realized that a light source had slightly blinded his field of vision.</p>\n<p>He began to look up. \"What is with that?\"</p>\n<p>He froze as he looked up at the source of the light.</p>\n<p>\"Holy, fucking shit,\" Alan said in complete shock.</p>\n<p>\"Welcome to the club, doctor,\" Agent Daughtry said with a giant grin.</p>\n<p>In front of Alan and Agent Daughtry was something Alan could barely put into words. It was as if the universe was a piece of glass that was dropped and shattered. Bright, shining cracks stood before him, floating and pulsating with radiant energy. Alan couldn't believe his eyes; what he was looking at broke all the research and studying he had ever done. At least that solves why I was recruited for this.</p>\n<p>\"What exactly was that?\" Alan asked as Daughtry handed him a cup of coffee.</p>\n<p>\"That, Doctor Morgan, is the dimensional rift to another universe. That's why you are here; maybe something in that brain of yours can help us close this one.\" Daughtry said as he bent over a table holder for a tablet.</p>\n<p>\"This one? There are others.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, there is one here. Then there are Site Blue and Site Red. One in Chile and the other in Antarctica.\" He said, handing Alan the tablet.</p>\n<p>\"So then, why am I here if there are two others?\" Alan said as he reached for his coffee.</p>\n<p>\"That's because those two are open, and hopefully, we can find a way to stop this one from opening as well. Fewer breaks in reality, the better; you know the drill.\" Daughtry said, chuckling.</p>\n<p>\"You seem very casual about this whole situation. I can't even wrap my head around it.\" Alan said, turning on the tablet.</p>\n<p>\"Well, I was stationed at Site Red not too long ago, so this place is like a vacation compared to that hellscape,\" Daughtry responded.</p>\n<p>\"Okay, so all the written information on this rift is on that tablet. Due to the pain and the ass effect of entity Silver, we cannot write anything about the world inside the rift. So all our written information so far is just of basic measurements and increases in size over the rift.\"</p>\n<p>Alan looked through the tablet's contents until his finger landed on the title, Site Red Journal. Alan clicked on it and saw a page titled Linear Algebra Notes.</p>\n<p>\"What is this journal that was scanned on the tablet? Is it math notes?\" Alan asked, putting the tablet on the table.</p>\n<p>\"That is the only written account of what is happening on the other side of the rift. You will want to read that to understand what we have going on. I'll be back in a bit. I need to run some routine checks.\" Agent Daughtry explained as he headed out of the room.</p>\n<p>\"Also, don't take any notes; those will also be affected. We don't know how it works, but it seems that the parts written by Joey are the only pages not affected by it.\" Daughtry quickly added as he poked his head around the corner before leaving again.</p>\n<p>Alan nodded, then looked back at the tablet. <em>What did they sign me up for?</em> He said to himself as he scrolled past all the math notes. He stopped when he saw the title of the initial journal entries. He picked up his coffee and began to read.</p>\n<hr/>\n<hr/>\n<p>5/3/2008</p>\n<p>My phone doesn't work. I don't know why. It won't turn on. It had a full battery when I ended up here. Nothing is making sense right now. I will write in my math notebook to keep me sane. Who knows, maybe someone will find this if I die here. I don't understand what's going on. I was walking home and decided to take a bit of a detour. I wanted to clear my head and walk through the woods. I was walking, and then, one second, I felt weird. My body vibrated for a split second; then, I was in a different place. I've been walking for a few hours in this place, or I don't know. I don't think I'm on Earth anymore. Everything here is just different. The grass is tall and comes up to my ankles, and the trees and other plants are more giant than they should be. The trees here are insane; they are so tall. I saw what I thought was a boar or pig; I didn't know it was huge, maybe the size of a horse. I didn't know what to do, so I hid behind a tree until it left. I'm scared. I'm terrified. I don't know what to do. What am I supposed to do? Stuff like this isn't supposed to happen. Things like this aren't supposed to be real. I need to compose myself. I'm happy I didn't eat my lunch today, at least. That should keep me going for a bit. But food and water will be problems soon. I don't want to die. I don't want to die alone.</p>\n<p>5/4/2008</p>\n<p>I didn't sleep when night came around. Or, I think that was night. Something is wrong with this place. Well, minus the fact that it's another planet. The sky is broken. \"Fractured\" sounds better. Parts of the sky are not complete; portions have been torn off. During the night, there were no stars; it was just black. It's not black; it's more like empty, just nothingness.</p>\n<p>I'm getting exhausted. I need to find a place to sleep or at least lie down. I've been walking for so long, trying to find some normalcy or a way out. I don't think I'm going to find anything. I'm pretty sure I'm getting close to dehydration. Or I'm just thirsty. My head is pounding from exhaustion. I am going to die here, alone.</p>\n<p>I've never been happier in my life. I found a river and didn't think twice about drinking from it. I heard it before I saw it. It's enormous, like, really, really huge. It seems to go on forever. Water has never tasted so good before in my life. There are also fruits here. They look like giant pomegranates but orange with hints of red. I wonder if they are edible; I'll find out when I get that hungry. I'm going to try to find a place to sleep. I haven't heard of or seen any animals, and it will be okay if I sleep. Well, I hope it will be. Hopefully, I won't get woken up by something eating me alive.</p>\n<p>5/10/2008</p>\n<p>It's been six days. I found a place to sleep in a small opening in a rock. It has some moss in it that's comfortable to lay on. I've been using my backpack as a pillow. I'm getting used to it. It doesn't change that I feel afraid and alone every time I try to sleep, but I'm getting better. It's close to the river and the fruits. Oh yeah, the fruits are delicious. They taste like apricots\u2014well, kind of. They taste like apricots with a watermelon aftertaste; it's bizarre. But this is the only food I have so far, so it will have to do. I haven't explored past the river; I'm too worried I will get lost. This is some stability I have in this messed-up place. So I'll take it.</p>\n<p>I don't know what I saw, but it was huge. I saw it over the trees; I think it was a massive bird. I didn't get a good look at it, but it left a huge shadow as it flew past. I could hear its wings flapping; whatever it was, it was huge. It makes me wonder what else is out there. I wish there were smaller animals, or at least fish, in the river. I don't know how long I can live off fruit and water. The only animals I saw beside the giant boar were deer-looking animals. They had four antlers and were red. They looked very pretty. I'll try to sketch a picture. Though I'm horrible at art, it may be fun to keep me occupied. I wonder what my family is thinking. They probably think I'm dead somewhere in a ditch or kidnapped. I want to see them again. I want to talk to them. I want to be hugged, and I want to feel safe again. They didn't think highly of me, but they must be worried.</p>\n<p>5/12/2008</p>\n<p>I need to figure out what I'm going to do. I have to be brave. But I don't want to. I want to be rescued. I want to be saved. I don't know what to do. I'm scared. I don't want to die alone.</p>\n<p>5/??/2028</p>\n<p>I lost track of how many days I had walked. I left the forest a few days ago and have followed the river for a while. It still has not ended and doesn't seem like it will. My legs are practically numb now; I'm so exhausted from walking. I have had to sleep in any hidden place I could find. I've seen a bunch of different animals now. They are all huge. No one has been smaller or close to my size. I've done a good job avoiding them, but I'm scared my luck will run out soon. I've been eating the fruit that I find along the river; there have been a few new types of fruits, so that has been nice. They are not enough, though; I feel sick. I know I'm missing the nutrients to live at this point. I don't know how long I have until it catches up. Oh, I almost forgot. I found an abandoned tent or something like that. It was left entirely; there was little sign of life. It was enormous; the doorway was maybe 12 feet tall. It was made with what I think is some leather; it looked similar to the deer creature I've seen a bunch of. It makes me wonder where the hell I am. This place doesn't make sense. I don't think the day and night work the same as they did on Earth. The \"sun,\" or light in the sky, is oddly centered and does not rise or set. It just turns on. I could have sworn it faded in and out a few times one day. It never moves; it just sits there. There is no light at night, so I follow the river closely and find a place to sleep.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">5/It doesn't matter anymore</span></p>\n<p>I give up. I'm tired. I don't feel well. I want to be at home. I don't want to die alone.</p>\n<hr/>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\"><br/>\nIt was quiet; Joey could only hear the river moving slowly. It had been his only constant this time\u2014water slowly moving across gravel and dirt. Water was moving constantly in an unseen direction. Joey took a deep breath and stretched out his legs, finding a smooth rock to sit on. Sitting, Joey thought about laying in the river and letting it carry him. He wondered where it went\u2014maybe a lake or grand ocean. He would never know, he thought. <em>I will die here</em>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">He had been walking for too long; everything was catching up to him. The exhaustion, only eating fruit, and the extreme. It was all building up, ready to crush and destroy him. Looking around, he took in his surroundings: the rushing water, the nine plains, and the bright standing light in the almost fake blue sky. <em>This is not the worst place to die, honestly</em>, Joey thought as he put his hands on his head; he had been appalled for the past few days. Joey understood well that his time was coming soon. <em>Should I get it over with? Do I go out on my terms?</em> That was the last thing Joey thought before the long silence was broken.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to be here,\u201d a loud voice spoke behind him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Joey's heart dropped as he looked in the direction of the voice. There, standing a few meters behind him, was the largest man he had ever seen. The man was unnaturally tall, maybe double Joey\u2019s height, with short silver hair pushed back, wearing silver robes with red lining. Bright silver earrings dangled with the wind, and over his right shoulder was one of the deer creatures Joey had seen. The tongue was sticking out and had a gash down its side.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\"Sorry, little one, I didn't mean to startle you,\u201d the man spoke as he slowly put the animal carcass on the ground. \u201cYou look sick; are you alright?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Joey's words were stuck in his throat; he didn't know if that was because of the man's physical nature or not having human contact for what felt like an eternity. The man looked down at Joey, tilted his head to the side, and nodded.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cYou seem like you need to eat. Here, I just caught this. I will make us something.\u201d He said this as he waved his hand, and as he did, bright silver particles spiraled around his writing. Then, a small silver fire was brought into existence with a spark.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Joey's head began to spin as he attempted to stand up, but his head felt as if it were one hundred pounds. Joey leaned back and lost consciousness as he fell. The large man caught him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Crackling sounds filled Joey\u2019s head as he slowly regained consciousness. He sat up and put his hands on his head, squinting from pain. Then, in an instant, his memory reawakened, and Joey shot to his feet in a panic. In front of him was an unknown man sitting on a small rock with two large sticks in his hands. Each stick had a cooked piece of meat.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\"Woah, now relax and be safe. I'm not going to hurt you.\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cWho are you? What are you? Wha\u2026\u201d Joey began before he was cut off.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cEat first, questions after.\u201d The man said this as he leaned forward and handed Joey one of the sticks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Joey didn't have enough energy to argue or try to ask again. He took the stick from the man and sat down across from him. Looking at the meat, Joey pushed himself to take a bite. \"Oh yeah. This is what food tastes like,\" Joey thought as he felt tears welling up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\"That good, huh? I didn't even add anything to it,\u201d the man said, chuckling.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cThank you,\u201d Joey responded with a chunk of meat still in his mouth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">The man smiled and nodded. \u201cNow, kid, why are you here?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">That question caught Joey off guard. He paused for a minute, thinking about how to answer that question.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cI don't know. I was walking home from school, and in a second, I was here. Wherever here is.\u201d Joey answered as he went for another bite of food.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">The man looked at Joey, puzzled for a few seconds, until the expression changed to a face of realization, and a grin appeared.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cSo the barrier is that weak now. Interesting, that's good news.\u201d He said this, looking at Joey. \"You're too small for a human, aren't you? What's your name?\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cMy name is Joey. Are you a bit big for a human?\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">The man laughed. \u201cWhat a strange name Joey is. You are not from here.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\"What's your name?\u201d Joey asked.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">The man paused for a minute. Then, he stood up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cMy name is Silas. I'm the king of this wonderful land we are on.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cKing?\u201d Joey said, coughing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">The man looked confused as he scratched his head and stomped out the silver fire. Then, looking back at Joey, he looked him up and down and smiled again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cCome with me, kid. I'll help you out,\u201d Silas said as he extended his large arm toward Joey.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cI will show you my kingdom.\u201d<br/></span></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\"><br/>\n\u201cWhat exactly are you, Silas?\u201d Joey asked, sitting on a floating platform of silver particles.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cWhat do you mean? I'm human, just like you. Unless you are not human?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cWell, I mean, you can do magic. That's not normal?\u201d Joey said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cWhat is magic?\u201d Silas responded.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cThe particles, the instant fire, you being ten feet tall. That has to be magic.\u201d Joey shot back.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cOh, are those things not every day for you? I can't imagine living in a place like that.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Joey tried to wrap his head around what was going on. He wasn't thinking about it since he had not eaten real food for so long. But now that Joey was thinking about it, everything made less sense. He was sitting on a platform made of shining particles, floating alongside a man who was ten feet tall. With that given, somehow Joey felt no fear towards Silas as if he had known the man for a long time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Looking around, Joey took in his surroundings. He never saw the world's beauty since he had been terrified for the last few weeks. The forest Joey came from was unbelievable. The trees' height and size were excellent, and the leaves were a shade of green he didn't know existed.<br/>\nThe plains he was currently in were also breathtaking; the grass seemed so perfect that it couldn't be real. He felt the calmness of the river as it pierced through the plains like a dagger into the distance. He felt relaxed for the first time in what felt like an eternity. He felt as if he was finally safe.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cAh, there it is. Home.\u201d Silas announced as they stopped moving.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Joey looked before him and was amazed at the sight that beheld him. It was an enormous city that shocked him in every aspect. Large buildings with intricate designs and large open spaces that reassembled outside theaters. Long roads and winding rivers ran through the city like veins. In the center of town was a building that was a combination of a cathedral and a castle. It had large banners dangling on the front that displayed the image of a spear through a book. It's incredible, Joey thought to himself as they entered the city.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cSo, little one, what do you think? Fantastical, right.\u201d Silas asked as he opened his arms to the city.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cI can't put it into words. This place is insane.\u201d Joey said, looking around.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cYes, it is. Welcome to The City of Stories, Fiert\u00e9.\u201d Silas said, looking back at Joey.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Silas ushered to Joey and began walking towards the city's center. Joey couldn't help himself from being mesmerized by his surroundings. It was like he was walking in a fantasy story, a magical city filled with fantastic uniqueness. However, something odd caught his attention. The town was dead silent. The only sounds were the sound of the two of them walking. <em>Where is everyone? This city is vast. People should be everywhere. But there is not a sign of life anywhere.</em> Joey questioned himself as he stopped walking.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cSilas, where is everyone?\u201d Joey questioned.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Silas stopped walking and took a look around. There was an uncomfortable pause, and then he spoke.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cDead. I am all that is left.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cOh. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to bring up anything bad.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cNo, No, it's quite alright. It's because of my own doing. I have had time to mourn.\u201d Silas said as he began to walk.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cLet's get more food and new clothes at the town center.\u201d He said, ushering Joey once again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cThis place used to be brimming with the brightest minds in this world. Hungry for the greatest tellings of adventures and tales. But now there is no one to share the telling of our world.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Silas paused again and then waved his hands. Bright silver particles began to flow around them and take the shapes of people. The people were walking around the city as if doing their daily tasks. Some stopped talking to one another while others wrote in books.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cThis city used to be a city of history. A place solely focused on the past that we could never return to. Our job was to hold the history of our long-forgotten world and keep it safe in our grand libraries.\u201d He loudly spoke as he kept walking.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cThe old royal families held that duty for generations. They were so focused on the past because they believed there was no future to look forward to since the Grand Collapse. So we clung to the idea that the history of our ancestors would be enough will to keep living, enough will to keep dreaming. But they were wrong.\u201d Silas said, looking at the sky as if the memory had pained him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cThen, one day, that old regime crumbled. What once was a city made for the past became a city for the future. The old regime was ripped from the throne, and a new Will sat on its throne. A will for the future that would be. A will to live, A will to dream. The once-dedicated historians became thrill seekers who sought out grand stories and legends from our fractured world. These people gathered stories of hunters seeking the monsters in the deep oceans and pilgrims claiming the islands burnt into the Sky. They hunted for tales of heroes who slayed the foulest creatures lurking in the deepest caverns. They scavenged for prophecies of future kings and queens. This is what Fiert\u00e9 is, a city of endless stories, the city of the future.\u201d Silas proclaimed as they approached the grand doors of the town center.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Silas waved his hands, and the people he created vanished as the particles dissipated. They entered the enormous building. The first thing Joey noticed was the large empty bookshelves that layered the inside of it. Looking around, he felt the emptiness deep in his soul. He could tell that this place used to be many people's homes, sharing stories and spending time together. Now, it displays a graveyard of lost dreams.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">They entered the second story and approached a hallway filled with doors. Silas opened the first door to the left and ushered Joey into it. It was a small room with a desk, bed, bookshelf, and closet. The closest was open and had silk robes hanging in it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cMake yourself at home, kid. I will grab you when I have food ready for the both of us.\u201d Silas said as he headed out of the room.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cThank you for saving me, Silas.\u201d Joey quickly said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Silas stopped walking momentarily and waved his hand at Joey as if to signal it was all good. Joey wasted no time taking off his clothes and hopping into the new ones provided for him. The robes were silver with light gold lining; they were the most comfortable clothes he had ever worn. Joey sat on the bed and looked out the window; he fought back tears of happiness as he thought. <em>I am safe.</em><br/></span></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Staring at the large platter of food in front of him, Joey almost felt himself cry again. Food has never looked so good before. It had a large piece of meat that looked perfect in every manner, a salad of unknown vegetables, and a pile of colorful fruit. Without much thought, Joey started to ravage the food as if he had never eaten in his life before. Every bite gave him more energy to eat more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cSlow down there, kid, you are going to choke yourself,\u201d Sylas said, laughing as he joined Joey at the table.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cBut it is so good. I can't stop,\u201d Joey said with a mouthful of food.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cI'm glad you like it. I have had a lot of time to practice my cooking skills.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cSo, Joey, tell me about the place you come from. You seem to live in a place very different from my home.\u201d He asked Joey.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cHmm, where do you want me to start? Our worlds share many similarities; the plant and animal life are close. Yours are just a good size larger, though.\u201d Joey replied.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cReally? So everything there is smaller?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Joey nodded as he swallowed a piece of meat.<br/>\n\u201cYeah, we also don't do magic. Or whatever you call that stuff you do with the particles.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cInteresting. So, how do you guys live then? How do you go places or fight the beasts of your world?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Joey started to laugh as he put his fork down.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cWe use cars and planes to get places. And we don't have beasts, or at least not the ones you think of. \u201c</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cWhat is a car? Is a plane a type of bird?\u201d Silas asked with a large amount of curiosity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cI mean a giant metal bird that someone flies. A car is a machine that has four wheels and drives on the streets.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cThis doesn't make any sense at all. Are you sure there is no? What did you call it, Magic, In your world.\u201d Sylas asked with a hint of disbelief.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cAh, man, you will need to see it for yourself. You will shit yourself visiting New York.\u201d Joey said, laughing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cMaybe one day, the time will come when I can leave this prison. But for now, getting you back to your home will suffice.\u201d Silas said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Joey stopped laughing and looked at Silas. <em>Why does he keep calling this place a prison? It is a paradise.</em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cYou are going to help me get back home? Really? Is it possible?\u201d Joey asked, leaning forward towards Silas.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cMaybe, I don't see why the Golden God wouldn't let you out. He has no issue with outsiders.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Joey grinned ear to ear. He could go home. Then Joey stopped for a second. He wondered if he would like to return to his mediocre life of nothingness. <em>Maybe I should stay; Silas seems alone, and perhaps I can learn the magic he does.</em> Joey thought.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cI'll take you to the Golden Tower under one condition,\u201d Silas said, holding up his pointer figure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cAnd that is?\u201d Joey asked.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cIf we take the long route and have an adventure. I haven't spoken to anyone in years; I don't want to waste the opportunity to learn new stories.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Joey stayed silent for a moment, thinking.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cYou have yourself a deal, Silas.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cWonderful. We will leave tomorrow morning. It will take us a very long time to reach the tower.\u201d Silas excitedly said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cJust out of curiosity, how long does the fast route take?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cIf I flew you there, it would take about a day. But since we are going to walk about a full cycle.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\"><em>Shit.</em><br/></span></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\"><br/>\nFiddling with the new shoes he found in the room he slept in, Joey sat on the steps of the outside theater Silas told him to meet him at. <em>How far is this tower he talks about? Better yet, what the hell is a Golden God?</em> Joey thought as he turned to the footsteps behind him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cGood morning, Joey. Are you ready for the adventure of your life?\u201d Silas said with a large grin.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cI think I have a few changes of clothes, but I couldn't make space for food,\u201d Joey responded, shuffling through his backpack.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cDon't worry about it. We will get food as we go along.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">That statement made Joey raise an eyebrow. He thought this would probably be a mistake, but he had no choice. Then, a random thought came into Joey\u2019s mind.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cHey Silas, you never told me. How did you become king? I understand the old king was overthrown, but how did you become king?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Silas began to laugh. He walked onto the stage and turned to face Joey.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cThat, my friend, is a story that to show than tell,\u201d Silas says as he raises his hands, and an enormous amount of silver particles fill the area.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Joey\u2019s eyes widened as the particles slowly formed into a scene. He could make out the town center and a young man walking to the large doors. It took Joey a few seconds, but he knew that the young man was a younger Silas.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">The younger Silas entered the hall and walked towards the center of the hall. The interior looked completely different from what Joey knew. It was closer to an actual castle, filled with banners and noblemen. In the back of the room was a man sitting on a throne. His crown on his head held an orange gem that glowed as bright as the sun. Upon seeing Silas, the man commanded everyone out of the building except for two guards beside his throne.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cKing Lotar of the Fire Soul, you pay for your crimes today!\u201d Silas yelled across the grand hall.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cAnd what crime would that be, Silas? The killing of your father? He brought that upon himself, starting that silly revolution.\u201d Lotar replied, looking at his fingers uncaringly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cNo, however, I will have my revenge for his death. No, your crime is holding this city in the past while the future is the only path!\u201d Silas retorted.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cSo your father has poisoned your mind as well. So be it. Guards, end this cursed bloodline so I can return to more pressing matters.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">The two guards beside the king stood straight and slowly walked towards Silas. Both knights wielded swords and shields, carrying gem-embedded shields similar to the king's crown. They both slammed their swords into the shields and ignited their blades into a brilliant orange fire. Silas held his hands in response, and the familiar silver particles formed around his fingers. In an instant, one of the knights screamed out in pain as a large silver spear slammed into his chest, pinning him into the wall. The other knight tried to close the distance on Silas rapidly, but Silas was already ahead, swiping his hand and slicing the air before him. Particles shot out and slammed into the Knight, removing his upper torso and sending it flying off.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">King Lotar shot to his feet with a face of confusion and anger.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cThat power. What did you do, Silas!?\u201d Lotar screamed as he approached Silas.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Silas ignored the question, manifested a shining silver spear, and pointed at the king.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cYou die today. False King.\u201d Silas yelled.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cSo be it. You will join your father in the afterlife.\u201d Lotar replied.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Lotar held up his hands and clapped once. With a bright light, both of his arms are ignited in bright flames, illuminating the empty building. Without much pause, Lotar shot from the stairs leading to his throne towards Silas, catching Silas off guard and landing a swift punch into his chest. The punch throws Silas into the town hall's large doors; Silas tries to get his footing back but is swiftly sent back to the ground with a knee to the face.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Grunting, Silas slams the ground, and a wall of silver spikes shoots from the ground, putting some distance between the two fighters. Lotar visibly smiled as he punched through the spikes and approached Silas again. Silas got to his feet, manifested two spears over his shoulders, and shot forward towards Lotar. Putting his fists together in a ball, Lotar prepared to slam the ground before them. However, Silas launched himself into the air with a sharp jump, shooting both spears directly at Lotar. Lotar held out his hands and caught both of the spears. Upon him grabbing them, they exploded into a million tiny silver spears. Piercing every inch of his body, Silas grabbed him by his left arm before he could react and swiftly landed three punches to the king's face. Silas then quickly manifested a small silver dagger and impaled Lotar in the lower gut; Lotar let out a small gasp as the air left his body.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cENOUGH!!\u201d Lotar screamed as the gem on his crown grew brighter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">With a bright flash, Lotar\u2019s entire body became engulfed in flames. Silas jumped back as fast as he could, just not fast enough. The blast of energy sent him shooting through the large entry doors of the town hall. Tumbling down the stairs to the town hall, Silas realized he was out in the open, and the city's citizens were staring at him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cEveryone, get back now!\u201d Silas commanded, waving his hands at them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">He kept trying to wave people off and didn't notice the flaming hand approaching him rapidly. Lotar shoots his palm onto Silas' face and slams him straight to the ground. Silas could feel the heat of the flames slowly starting to burn his face. Panicking, Silas manifested five spears floating above them and, with a move of his finger, slammed them into Lotar. Blood shot out of Lotar\u2019s nose and mouth as he started to lose grip on Silas' face. Silas manifested another dagger with his other hand and slashed Lotar's arm clean off. Gasping, Silas scrambled back before getting to his feet. Lotar struggled to move but couldn't. The spears Silas manifested just a second ago, holding Lotar in place as blood poured down each of them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cThat power\u2026 What god\u2026 did you sell your\u2026. soul for Silas?\u201d Lotar whispered as blood poured out of his mouth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Silas walked up to Lotar and manifested a long silver sword.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cI hate you for what you did to my father. I hate you to my core. But I have to thank you, Lotar. Thank you for being a part of my story.\u201d Silas said he had held up the sword.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">With one quick motion, Silas decapitated the King. He knelt and picked up the crown that used to sit upon Lotar's head. Citizens of the city stood around, entirely still, staring at Silas. Silas then raised the crown into the air and crushed it. A bright orange light shone bright for a few seconds before fading away. Looking around at all the people's faces staring at him, Silas held up his hands to the sky. And let out a giant yell of triumph.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Joey sat there in awe as the particles began to fade. He could see Silas, the current Silas, seated on the edge of the stage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cI was a bit rusty back then with my powers. Made that fight a bit one-sided for a while.\u201d He said with a smile as he stood up and walked to Joey.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cDid that suffice enough for an answer?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cAre you kidding me? That was fucking badass. You can do all of those things?\u201d Joey replied with excitement in his voice.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cWhat was with that fire? Is that more magic? What exactly is your power? Joey asked as he also stood up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cWoah, Woah, one at a time, Joey. I'll tell you all about that stuff during our adventure. I think it's time we head out now.\u201d Silas said as he walked past Joey.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Joey nodded, picked up his backpack, and began following Silas out of the City of Stories.<br/></span></p>\n<hr/>\n<p>I forgot I had this still deep in my backpack. I planned to recap what happened, but he beat me to it. I didn't see him write them, so I guess he used some of his magic. It seems like something he would write. It is in his style, loud, descriptive, and extravagant; some details are exaggerated, but that's fine. It kind of makes me happy he kept track of our meetings. It's been about a month now since I've been here. Now that I think about it, it's probably been longer. We have been walking for about two weeks now.</p>\n<p>So, let's see what he missed writing about. Nothing really except for, you know, the whole other world stuff. This world is lovely, and it's just amazing. There is only nature. It's something I thought I would never see in my life. It may sound silly, but not hearing any form of civilization is weird. I'm so used to the sounds of cars, people, and everything. But being alone in this vast wilderness is almost enlightening. I just remembered Silas explains the world or whatever is left of it. There is Astralglade, which is where we currently are and where the Fiert\u00e9 is. Then there is the Grand Ocean Oarlenza. He also said that there used to be a floating city that lived above the sea. Then, more to the East is the continent of Drukal. He told me it was mainly inhabitable mountains and deep caves. And then lastly, in the center of it all, we are heading towards the Gold Tower. It's where the god that rules the land lives and my ticket out.</p>\n<p>What else happened? Silas and I have just been walking and talking about each other's life. I asked about his family. He would probably not mind if I talked about them here. Silas told me he didn't know his mother since she died giving birth to him, but he and his father were very close. He talks a lot about his father. It seems he left a very lasting effect on Silas. His father's name was Jean-Reylein, and he was the advisor to the now-dead king, Lotar. Jean-Reylein started the Revolt of Stories, and it seems that, like Silas, they both value the future more than the past. After a few protests and a large-scale revolt, Lotar had Jean-Reylein executed for his crimes.<br/>\nWhich pushed Silas to follow through with what his father had started. However, I feel like Silas had other motives to kill Lotar than just his father's death. He always talks about this Grand Story. He won't ever tell me what that means or why it's so important to him, but it seems very personal, so I don't want to keep asking.</p>\n<p>I wish I had a father like Jean-Reylein. From what Silas tells me about him, he was an overall caring man who wanted Silas to accomplish great things. A man who wanted the best for his city and the people he cared about. My father sees me as more of a burden; I have never really been good at much, so my father ignored me. He never got mad and never complimented him; to him, I was just in his life. Like I was something he was supposed to feed, clothe, and send off to school. I remember the time I got lost when we took a skiing trip; I fell into a ditch and lost one of my skis. It was cold, and I couldn't navigate through the forest. It had to have been an hour, then when I finally found my way to the bottom of the mountain, He was mad and thought I had run off. I told him I fell and got lost in the woods; he yelled at me and called me a lair. He said I was just a spoiled kid, and now he had to buy a new pair of skis. From that point on, I only really talked to him a little. I just didn't see him as family anymore.</p>\n<p>Well, I'm going to sleep now. We still have much walking to do until we reach the Golden Tower. From what I gather, it will probably be another nine to ten months of walking. This is incredible; I will live out my own story for once. My adventure.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cDo you think it will taste good?\u201d Joey asked, peering over the large mole-like creature Silas just killed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cNo idea. I've never killed one of these before.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cReally? I'm surprised you wouldn't have gotten to everything by now.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cWell, that's the thing, Joey. This creature isn't from here. I'm pretty sure it's from Drukal.\u201d Silas said, kneeling to the creature.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cThen why would it be here? Isn't that far from here?\u201d Joey questioned.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">A faint crack sounds behind them; Silas stops moving and stands utterly silent. Joey looked at Silas for a few seconds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Confused, Joey asked.<br/>\n\u201cWhy did you stop tal-\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cGet down, Joey!\u201d Silas yelled, reaching and pushing Joey to his knees.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Sounds of trees smashing to bits sound off as a large object swings fast over Joey's head. Before Joey could regain his bearings, he felt Silas grab harder on his shoulder and launch them out of the tree line. Joey noticed trees torn down as they landed in an open field next to the forest. Fuck, Was the only thought Joey\u2019s brain could muster.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">The creature dragged itself out of the forest, its enormous body slamming against the surrounding trees as it did. It was a creature Joey thought could only exist in fantasy stories. It was a giant lizard covered in large brown scales closer to rocks than flesh. Its front two arms carried three large claws that shined like diamonds. The creature's back was covered in sharp spikes and one prominent ridge down its spine. Its tail was a weapon in itself; at the end of its tail was a large sphere bone piece. It's one eye was staring at Joey and Silas, unwavering in its goal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">The creature shot forward with speed that didn't match its hulking body mass. Silas reacted to the beast's aggression by grabbing Joey and jumping into the air. Joey felt his stomach drop as he rushed into the air by Silas, whose back now held four silver wings. Constructed of silver particles, the top two wings were grand with sharp edges and dropping particles. Meanwhile, the bottom two were much smaller and moved with the upper wings. Silas was holding on to Joey by the waist like a small handbag.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">The creature opened its mouth and let out a high-pitched screech, obliterating the ground under them. Then, it looked up to Silas and Joey, hovering in the sky, opening its mouth wide again to send another screech. Silas raised his free hand and created four spears, and with the movement of his hand toward the beast, they shot forward with striking speed. The spears slammed into the creature's legs and tail, pinning them to the ground. It uttered a loud cry and moved its head to attempt to remove one of the spears with its mouth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Silas strengthens his grip on Joey.<br/>\n\u201cDon't let go, Joey.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Silver particles began to form around Silas' feet, creating bright silver armored boots. Then his wings stretched to great lengths, and with a loud crack, he shot down towards the beast, slamming his foot into its head.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Joey was sitting on a downed log, staring at the body of the beast Silas just killed. It happened so fast that he didn't understand what happened. He did feel sick for the amount Silas flung around him in the air. <em>Without Silas, I would have died a while ago. I forgot I am in a world I don't know, filled with things I don't understand. I got lost in the idea of it all.</em> Joey thought to himself as he noticed Silas fidgeting with the creature's head.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cThat was a bit too close for comfort. I'm stronger than the creatures here; however, you are not.\u201d Silas said as he began to open the creature's jaw.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cI mean, what would you have to do? That creature was the size of two school buses.\u201d Joey responded.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cI get that, but I can't protect you every waking hour, so I'm going to do something for you,\u201d Silas said as he ripped one of the large teeth from the beast's jaw.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cThis will be the first effigy of the future in years. I wonder if I can still do it.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">He said as he held The white tooth in his hand. Silver particles began to flow around his hand and circled the tooth. Then, the particles completely enveloped the tooth and began to shine a bright silver glow. The particles immediately dissipated with a quick cracking noise, and in Silas's hand was something new. In his hand sat a dagger. The blade was the tooth of the beast sharpened and reinforced with a silver lining down the middle. The handle was a bright silver with white spaces about the length of it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Silas walked over to Joey and flipped the dagger so the handle was facing Joey. Joey stared at the dagger for a bit. Just looking at it, he could tell something about it seemed off. It almost felt alive, he thought. Joey pushed past the feeling and grabbed the hilt, and the second his fingers wrapped around it, his mind traveled somewhere far. His surroundings completely changed in just a few seconds, floating in the empty universe. The stars and galaxies cracked with what seemed like beating, breathing veins of silver particles. They all blinked simultaneously, gripping the stars and universe at once. Then, as soon as it came, it was gone. He was back sitting on the log with the dagger in hand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cDid you see it, Joey?\u201d Silas asked, staring at Joey with a big smile.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cWhat the actual fuck was that?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cAh, so you did, that\u2019s good. The dagger I made for you, Joey, is called an Effigy.\u201d Silas said as he pointed to the dagger in Joey's hand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cEffigies are items that are given the blessings of a great Will. I created this one for you. What you saw when you held on to it was the Will itself. The will of the Future. My will is now yours. It is our will.\u201d</span></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\"><br/>\nPushing the branch out of his face, Joey looked at the large boar creature grazing on the tall grass before him. He moved his hand toward his waist, where his dagger sat, and he slowly gripped the handle. Joey felt energy and excitement run through his body when his hands wrapped around the blade. With his free hand, he pushed himself forward from the bush in a fast motion, shooting forward faster than any human should be able to move. The giant boar saw him and squealed as it put its head down to prepare to charge. Joey raised his dagger and slashed in the air before him, sending a line of silver particles toward the boar. The slash collided with the boar and sent it into a tree; Joey planted his left foot into the ground to stop himself. He was going too fast, tripping over his feet and tumbling onto the ground.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cShit, I went too fast.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">The enormous boar looked at Joey as it picked itself back up. It put its head back down and began to charge at Joey. He felt a bit of panic as he looked at the creature's four large horns on top of its head as it closed the distance between them. The boar was almost three times larger than him and looked twice as nasty. Its dark red fur is covered in scars and wounds, and the boar means to kill Joey. As it ran towards him, the ground tore as its large legs ripped through the terrain. Joey felt a deep sense of fear as it got closer. He couldn't form any honest thoughts, and I'm going to die. Joey thought to himself as his heart sank farther and farther into despair. He felt a twitch in his hand and looked at his dagger. Silver particles began to seep from the blade, and all the anguish and fear were instantly gone. He was in complete mental harmony as if something forcefully cleared his mind for him. A new wave of clarity moved his body for him. He put his dagger handle in his mouth and raised his hands out in front of him. The boar slammed itself into Joey. He grabbed two of the tusks on the boar's head. And with all his might, he raised the creature and threw it over his head.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">The boar landed on its back and let out a grotesque squeal as it attempted to get back up. Throwing its body side to side, trying its hardest to return to its feet. A silver spear shot through the tree line and entered the beast's chest, finally silencing its cries. Joey Turned around as Silas walked into view, waving to Joey with a smile.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cDid you see that, Silas? I was fucking awesome!.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Silas walked up to Joey and smiled even more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cYes, you were amazing. You are a natural.\u201d Silas responded as he held out his hand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Joey reached up and high-fived Silas.<br/>\n\u201cI tried everything you told me to do. I panicked for a bit, but I figured it out in the end.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cDid the Will help you? Did something reach out and help you?\u201d Silas said as he picked up the boar.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cEffigies are directly connected to the Will itself, so in times of need, it will seek you out and help your mind and body.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cSo, like the force?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cWhat's that?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cOh, I forgot. Never mind, ignore me.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Joey stared into the dark sky as the fire crackled before him. Silas was cutting a piece of meat off the boar Joey killed earlier that day. They had eaten this type of animal before, but it tasted better since he was the one who got it for them. He had never felt so proud of himself, and Silas's praise made him feel even better. Joey finally thought he was doing things for gain, making his own story. It will be over soon, and the Golden Tower is close. He said to himself as he looked past the forest they were in. Their goal, The Golden Tower, was almost in grasp. Its bright, shining lite irradiated throughout the dark sky, the only sours of light in the dark sky. The tower climbs into the sky until it reaches its top, where the bright light that serves as the sun and the moon resides. The closer Joey looked at it, the grander it became. Each inch of the tower is marble with veins of beating gold lining it all.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cSilas, why is the tower the only light source here?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cI thought I already told you?\u201d Silas responded, putting down his food.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cYou said something about a great destruction or something along that line. But not really into detail about it.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Silas let out a sigh and strained his back.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cJoey, will you listen this time, please.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Silas looked up to the night sky and began to speak.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cA few generations ago, there was something in our universe eating and devouring all existence. It was not a thing but more of the idea of destruction and eradication. The people of the time noticed stars and suns disappearing without a trace. It was almost too late when it was understood what was happening. Most of our world had already been devoured, leaving it in its current state.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cDid it just stop?\u201d Joey interrupted.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cNo, Joey, it didn't just stop. I'm getting to that if you can just wait.\u201d Silas responded before continuing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cThe current Golden god of the time, Cailiem, used all the power the Will of The Cosmos had to summon the threat into a physical form. No texts or records of the physical form have been written down since most people at the time described it as indescribable. Cailiem killed the entity, and wanting to keep what remained of the world stable, he created two Effigies. One was the Golden Tower to stabilize the physical world; then, he created the Heart of the Cosmos to stabilize the intangible world. Doing this, he sacrificed most of Will\u2019s power, leaving him and the future generations of Golden gods weaker. However, the Will of The Cosmos is still the most potent force in this universe. \u201c</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cWait, Wait, the tower is an Effigy?\u201d Joey asked.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cThat is your question? Not about the creature that ended the universe or the god that killed it. But is it an Effigy?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Silas let out a sigh.<br/>\n\u201cAnything can be an Effigy. As long as a Great Will attaches to it, it becomes an Effigy. There are even cases of humans becoming Effigies.\u201d Silas responded.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cOh, that's amazing.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cYes, it is Joey. Yes, it is.\u201d Silas said, pausing for a moment after.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cThank you for going on this journey with me, Joey. It's been years since I've been able to tell and hear stories. You don't know how much this means to me.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">This statement caught Joey off guard.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cOf course. I mean, you are keeping me safe until I make it back home. Thank you, Silas.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cReally? I think you would have figured it out by yourself.\u201d Silas said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Joey let out a laugh.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cSilas, it's probably been over a year since we traveled together. When you found me at the river, I thought about giving up. You have kept me alive for this long. You have kept me company. You have taken me on an adventure of a lifetime. Silas, you are my friend.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Silas smiled back at Joey.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cYou are my friend too, Joey.\u201d<br/></span></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cSilas, What the fuck is that.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Before them stood a giant construct, a tall human-shaped machine. A grand creation standing three stories tall, built of bright white marble. The joints of the machine beat with bright gold particles that shined as bright as the light in the tower. Above its armored skull sat three bright gold halos hovering above. On its back was another large halo floating vertically behind it. The construct\u2019s one golden eye stared at Silas, unwavering and unmoving.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Joey looked towards Silas and was surprised to see such an ugly expression. Silas looked like he was staring down the devil himself, and Joey could feel the hate and contempt. In the more than a year he has traveled with Silas, Silas has never shown any form of hate or anger towards anything.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cThat Joey Is my Warden. It's my punishment for my sins.\u201d Silas says, sitting down on a small rock.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cThis stain of power restricts me from leaving this empty city. It watches me as he sits there and rots, laughing at my misery.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cSilas, what are you talking about? What sin?\u201d Joey asked carefully.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cSit down, Joey. I have one more story to tell you.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cAbout three years ago, I traveled the world and gathered the other Will holders to challenge the current Golden God.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cWhy would you want to do that, Silas? Are they not the thing holding the universe together?\u201d<br/>\nJoey asked</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cYou don't understand. I needed to challenge him. I needed to take him off that throne. I needed him to die for my story.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Silas paused for a few seconds. Then he looked at Joey with a straight, unfeeling expression.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cFirst, I went to the country of mountains to meet with Olbier. Olbier did not take much convincing since he and his people worshipped an old god and did not respect the Will of the Cosmos. Olbier is the holder of the Will of Worship, a mighty warrior of unmatched physical strength. A man of protection and care for his people and his god.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Silas looked west with an expression of sadness and disdain.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cHe did not deserve his fate,\u201d Silas said, looking back at Joey.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cAfter that, I met with the queen of the Sky and the Prince of the deep. First, I met with the Prince, who denied me at every stage. That coward wanted nothing to do with becoming known throughout history. Maybe we would have won against that insect in the tower with him. The Queen initially was not for the idea of challenging the Golden God, but telling Morlaya that she could soar through the cosmos with no restrictions piqued her interest enough to agree. With those two backing me, we challenge the god.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Silas\u2019s expression changed from uncaring to anger as he continued.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cWe climbed the tower and challenged that disgusting, arrogant bastard in his throne room. The Will of the Cosmos was not what it used to be, and his death should have been swift and easy. However, we underestimated him as much as he underestimated us. We hurt him gravely, and he now sits there waiting to draw his last breath on his throne. And for that, he punished us gravely. He tore the wings off of the Morlaya and sunk her and her sky city into the ocean she so despised. Then, he corrupted Olbier's mind, turning him into a raging marauder. Oblier, in a rage, went back to his country and murdered most of the people he swore to protect, turning the rest into rage-filled monsters bent on the death of everything that moves.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Silas stood up, spoke angrily, and spit as he yelled.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cAnd for me, that disgusting fraud tore the memory of our grand battle from my head. He knew that I prized that more than my own life. He knew that I NEEDED THAT FOR MY STORY! HE KNEW I LOVED STORIES MORE THAN MY OWN LIFE. HE TOOK EVERYTHING FROM ME. HE ERASED ALL THE STORIES OF MY CITY AND ERASED ALL THE PEOPLE. HE MADE SURE I HAD NOTHING LEFT. THAT WAS HIS MISTAKE, I WILL NOT STOP FOR ANYTHING, MY STORY WILL BE COMPLETED. AND I WILL WATCH AS HE BLEEDS AND DIES IN HIS THRONE!\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Joey felt his heart sink as the man he had spent more than a year with became something that scared him. It was like he was staring at a new man. The Silas Joey has spent this time with would never act like this. He would never be this angry. He felt scared of him for the first time since Joey met Silas. This man was double his height, wielded magic, and could tear him limb from limb. In a world he did not understand, the reality of his situation started to hit Joey. He was in a place he didn't know with someone Joey thought he knew well. He wanted to run away from him for the first time since he met Silas. He wanted to go home.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cSorry about that, Joey. I just lose myself when I think about what HE took from me.\u201d Silas said, composing himself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Joey didn't know what to say and felt scared that anything he said would make Silas angry again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cSilas, I don't understand. You challenged him, did you not? Why would you do that.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Silas approached Joey and put one of his large hands on his shoulder.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cOh, my little Joey. You may not see it now. But when my story is complete, it will all make sense. It will make sense to you. It will make sense to that golden insect. It will make sense to the universe.\u201d Silas said with a look that made Joey frightened for his life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Silas then bent down on his knees and hugged Joey.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cMy dear friend. I will miss you dearly. But it is time for you to go back to your home. The warden will let you pass. There, the Golden God should let you leave. He has no quarry with you.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Silas let go of Joey and stood back up. He pointed to a large set of stairs at the bottom of your tower.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cNow go, Joey, Finish your part of the story.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">My part? Joey thought as he started to walk towards the tower. He walked past the warden, and it didn't budge or look at him. Its gaze stayed unmoving on Silas. Joey got to the first step of the stairs and looked back at Silas, who was still standing there staring at Joey. Joey took his first step, and a sharp feeling of distress shot through his body. He looked back and saw Silas now crying.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">Joey completely froze as a sense of pure dread felt through his body.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#c4aead\">\u201cThank you for being a part of my story, Joey.\u201d</span></p>\n<hr/>\n<hr/>\n<p><em>Well, shit</em>. Alan thought as he put the tablet back on the table. That gave me more questions than answers. He took another sip of his coffee as he stood up and looked out the window towards the giant rift in reality. <em>What exactly am I looking at? The border of another universe dying and colliding with ours.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cSo, Doctor, what do you think.\u201d Alan turned his head to look at Daughtry as he entered the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cHonestly, I don't know; I have more questions than answers right now,\u201d Alan said to Daughtry.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat's what I thought; this isn't our normal issue here. We are pretty much playing a waiting game with this.\u201d Daughtry said as he joined Alan at the table.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I guess entity Silver is this King of Stories? Are there other things like that at the other Sites?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPretty much; the only reason we call it entity Silver is because its existence is unconfirmed. But I doubt it will stay like that for long. And yes, we are dealing with a slew of entities for which we are unprepared. But that's in our job description.\u201d Daughtry responded.</p>\n<p>Alan cracked a small smile and looked back out the window. It was hypnotizing, the idea and impossibility of it all. He never thought he would come face to face with something this unreal in his career at the Foundation. The sound of a walkie-talkie buzzing grabbed Alan\u2019s attention, and he turned to face Daughtry. Daughtry went to reach for the walkie-talkie, but as his hand held the device, both of them froze. A loud, earth-shattering cracking sound echoed everywhere around them. Alan put his hands over his head and went under the table, believing it to be some form of earthquake.</p>\n<p>Agent Daughtry tapped the top of the table and calmly sat up.<br/>\n\u201cDon't worry, that\u2019s normal. That means the rift is expanding.\u201d He said as he walked to the window.</p>\n<p>Without warning, red lights and a blaring alarm rang through the site. Yelling and sprinting footsteps echo the hallways. Alan looks towards the window, seeing Agent Daughtry standing entirely still.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, that is not normal.\u201d He says before he sprints out of the room, yelling something as he does.</p>\n<p>Alan sat under the table, not wanting to move; the alarm echoed through the room, and the thundering sound that the rift was making shook him to his core. <em>WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON</em>. Building the courage, Alan left the table's safety and headed towards the window. He grabbed the railing of it and pulled himself up to take a look outside. What he saw made his heart drop to the ground.</p>\n<p>The rift wash was shaking violently, and bright silver particles were seeping through the cracks of the other universe. The loud cracking sound kept increasing as more particles shot through the rift. Large fingers could be seen slowly leaving the rift and grabbing the sides of the tear, slowly pulling the rift apart. The rift was torn inch by inch, creating a loud sound that brought Alan to his knees. Then, everything went silent, not even the downpour that had presided for hours.</p>\n<p>Looking out the window, Alan felt his soul leave his body. Standing in front of the rift was a man who had to be no shorter than ten feet tall with short silver hair and glistening earrings to match. There was no doubting it: this was Entity Silver, the King of Stories.<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#c4aead\"><br/>\nSilas raised his arms out to the new sky in front of him. Free from the dying cage of his sins. Free from the eyes of the frail god that lay dying on his throne. Free from the Will of the Cosmos.<br/></span></p>\n<div class=\"licensebox\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">\u2021\u00a0Hide\u00a0Licensing\u00a0/\u00a0Citation</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p>Cite this page as:</p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\"> <div class=\"list-pages-item\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/will-of-the-future\">Will of The Future</a>\" by Bhomas Tourget, from the <a href=\"https://scpwiki.com\">SCP Wiki</a>.

Clinging to a Will that was never your own, so what gives you the right to hold back mine? Yours is the Will of a dead dream; mine is the Will of the future.\n\n\n\n[[/span]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nA loud crash of thunder woke Alan from his sleep. Rubbing his eyes, he looked out the window to his right. Pouring rain ran down the window as another loud crash of thunder rang out.\n\n\n\n\"We will be there in two minutes, Dr. Morgan,\" the driver stated, checking his watch.\n\n\n\nAlan nodded and looked back out the window. He didn't understand why he was specifically called for this assignment. He was a reality specialist; he couldn't fathom why the Foundation would have him drive out so quickly. Why was this so under wraps? //I didn't even know we had a site out here,// he thought as the car stopped.\n\n\n\n\"Alright, Doctor, we are here.\"\n\n\n\nAlan opened the car door to heavy, pouring rain. He flipped up his jacket as a makeshift umbrella and dashed to the front of the site. Standing before the illuminated door was a Foundation security agent with his hands on his waist.\n\n\n\n\"Welcome to Site Silver, Dr. Morgan. I hope your drive went well,\" the man said, reaching out to Alan.\n\n\n\n\"It was long, but no trouble,\" Alan responded as they headed indoors.\n\n\n\n\"My name is Agent Daughtry. I'm the head of Site Silver Security and Safety. How familiar are you with Project Tall-Tale?\" Daughtry asked as they walked down the hall.\n\n\n\n\"Not much. I'm not entirely sure why I was redirected to this site. Granted, I didn't know this site existed.\"\n\n\n\n\"Okay, yeah, this project has been held pretty tight under security so as not to freak out the entirety of the Foundation. Follow me, and I'll show you why you are here.\" Daughtry pointed to two large stealth doors.\n\n\n\nThey approached the door; Agent Daughtry signaled to the cameras, and the large doors began to open. The sounds of heavy rain then once again filled the air. Alan put his hands over his face as they began to walk into the heavy downpour. All around him, he could see an unnatural amount of security personnel. Large mounted machine guns lined the tops of the walls, and about thirty armed personnel were around the large containment chamber.\n\n\n\nA large gust of wind made Alan stop for a second and look at the ground to avoid getting rain in his eyes. At that point, he realized that a light source had slightly blinded his field of vision.\n\n\n\nHe began to look up. \"What is with that?\"\n\n\n\nHe froze as he looked up at the source of the light.\n\n\n\n\"Holy, fucking shit,\" Alan said in complete shock.\n\n\n\n\"Welcome to the club, doctor,\" Agent Daughtry said with a giant grin.\n\n\n\nIn front of Alan and Agent Daughtry was something Alan could barely put into words. It was as if the universe was a piece of glass that was dropped and shattered. Bright, shining cracks stood before him, floating and pulsating with radiant energy. Alan couldn't believe his eyes; what he was looking at broke all the research and studying he had ever done. At least that solves why I was recruited for this.\n\n\n\n\"What exactly was that?\" Alan asked as Daughtry handed him a cup of coffee.\n\n\n\n\"That, Doctor Morgan, is the dimensional rift to another universe. That's why you are here; maybe something in that brain of yours can help us close this one.\" Daughtry said as he bent over a table holder for a tablet.\n\n\n\n\"This one? There are others.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes, there is one here. Then there are Site Blue and Site Red. One in Chile and the other in Antarctica.\" He said, handing Alan the tablet.\n\n\n\n\"So then, why am I here if there are two others?\" Alan said as he reached for his coffee.\n\n\n\n\"That's because those two are open, and hopefully, we can find a way to stop this one from opening as well. Fewer breaks in reality, the better; you know the drill.\" Daughtry said, chuckling.\n\n\n\n\"You seem very casual about this whole situation. I can't even wrap my head around it.\" Alan said, turning on the tablet.\n\n\n\n\"Well, I was stationed at Site Red not too long ago, so this place is like a vacation compared to that hellscape,\" Daughtry responded.\n\n\n\n\"Okay, so all the written information on this rift is on that tablet. Due to the pain and the ass effect of entity Silver, we cannot write anything about the world inside the rift. So all our written information so far is just of basic measurements and increases in size over the rift.\"\n\n\n\nAlan looked through the tablet's contents until his finger landed on the title, Site Red Journal. Alan clicked on it and saw a page titled Linear Algebra Notes.\n\n\n\n\"What is this journal that was scanned on the tablet? Is it math notes?\" Alan asked, putting the tablet on the table.\n\n\n\n\"That is the only written account of what is happening on the other side of the rift. You will want to read that to understand what we have going on. I'll be back in a bit. I need to run some routine checks.\" Agent Daughtry explained as he headed out of the room.\n\n\n\n\"Also, don't take any notes; those will also be affected. We don't know how it works, but it seems that the parts written by Joey are the only pages not affected by it.\" Daughtry quickly added as he poked his head around the corner before leaving again.\n\n\n\nAlan nodded, then looked back at the tablet. //What did they sign me up for?// He said to himself as he scrolled past all the math notes. He stopped when he saw the title of the initial journal entries. He picked up his coffee and began to read.\n\n\n\n------\n\n------\n\n\n\n5/3/2008\n\n\n\nMy phone doesn't work. I don't know why. It won't turn on. It had a full battery when I ended up here. Nothing is making sense right now. I will write in my math notebook to keep me sane. Who knows, maybe someone will find this if I die here. I don't understand what's going on. I was walking home and decided to take a bit of a detour. I wanted to clear my head and walk through the woods. I was walking, and then, one second, I felt weird. My body vibrated for a split second; then, I was in a different place. I've been walking for a few hours in this place, or I don't know. I don't think I'm on Earth anymore. Everything here is just different. The grass is tall and comes up to my ankles, and the trees and other plants are more giant than they should be. The trees here are insane; they are so tall. I saw what I thought was a boar or pig; I didn't know it was huge, maybe the size of a horse. I didn't know what to do, so I hid behind a tree until it left. I'm scared. I'm terrified. I don't know what to do. What am I supposed to do? Stuff like this isn't supposed to happen. Things like this aren't supposed to be real. I need to compose myself. I'm happy I didn't eat my lunch today, at least. That should keep me going for a bit. But food and water will be problems soon. I don't want to die. I don't want to die alone.\n\n\n\n5/4/2008\n\n\n\n\n\nI didn't sleep when night came around. Or, I think that was night. Something is wrong with this place. Well, minus the fact that it's another planet. The sky is broken. \"Fractured\" sounds better. Parts of the sky are not complete; portions have been torn off. During the night, there were no stars; it was just black. It's not black; it's more like empty, just nothingness.\n\n\n\nI'm getting exhausted. I need to find a place to sleep or at least lie down. I've been walking for so long, trying to find some normalcy or a way out. I don't think I'm going to find anything. I'm pretty sure I'm getting close to dehydration. Or I'm just thirsty. My head is pounding from exhaustion. I am going to die here, alone.\n\n\n\nI've never been happier in my life. I found a river and didn't think twice about drinking from it. I heard it before I saw it. It's enormous, like, really, really huge. It seems to go on forever. Water has never tasted so good before in my life. There are also fruits here. They look like giant pomegranates but orange with hints of red. I wonder if they are edible; I'll find out when I get that hungry. I'm going to try to find a place to sleep. I haven't heard of or seen any animals, and it will be okay if I sleep. Well, I hope it will be. Hopefully, I won't get woken up by something eating me alive.\n\n\n\n\n\n5/10/2008\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's been six days. I found a place to sleep in a small opening in a rock. It has some moss in it that's comfortable to lay on. I've been using my backpack as a pillow. I'm getting used to it. It doesn't change that I feel afraid and alone every time I try to sleep, but I'm getting better. It's close to the river and the fruits. Oh yeah, the fruits are delicious. They taste like apricots\u2014well, kind of. They taste like apricots with a watermelon aftertaste; it's bizarre. But this is the only food I have so far, so it will have to do. I haven't explored past the river; I'm too worried I will get lost. This is some stability I have in this messed-up place. So I'll take it.\n\n\n\nI don't know what I saw, but it was huge. I saw it over the trees; I think it was a massive bird. I didn't get a good look at it, but it left a huge shadow as it flew past. I could hear its wings flapping; whatever it was, it was huge. It makes me wonder what else is out there. I wish there were smaller animals, or at least fish, in the river. I don't know how long I can live off fruit and water. The only animals I saw beside the giant boar were deer-looking animals. They had four antlers and were red. They looked very pretty. I'll try to sketch a picture. Though I'm horrible at art, it may be fun to keep me occupied. I wonder what my family is thinking. They probably think I'm dead somewhere in a ditch or kidnapped. I want to see them again. I want to talk to them. I want to be hugged, and I want to feel safe again. They didn't think highly of me, but they must be worried.\n\n\n\n5/12/2008\n\n\n\nI need to figure out what I'm going to do. I have to be brave. But I don't want to. I want to be rescued. I want to be saved. I don't know what to do. I'm scared. I don't want to die alone.\n\n\n\n\n\n5/??/2028\n\n\n\nI lost track of how many days I had walked. I left the forest a few days ago and have followed the river for a while. It still has not ended and doesn't seem like it will. My legs are practically numb now; I'm so exhausted from walking. I have had to sleep in any hidden place I could find. I've seen a bunch of different animals now. They are all huge. No one has been smaller or close to my size. I've done a good job avoiding them, but I'm scared my luck will run out soon. I've been eating the fruit that I find along the river; there have been a few new types of fruits, so that has been nice. They are not enough, though; I feel sick. I know I'm missing the nutrients to live at this point. I don't know how long I have until it catches up. Oh, I almost forgot. I found an abandoned tent or something like that. It was left entirely; there was little sign of life. It was enormous; the doorway was maybe 12 feet tall. It was made with what I think is some leather; it looked similar to the deer creature I've seen a bunch of. It makes me wonder where the hell I am. This place doesn't make sense. I don't think the day and night work the same as they did on Earth. The \"sun,\" or light in the sky, is oddly centered and does not rise or set. It just turns on. I could have sworn it faded in and out a few times one day. It never moves; it just sits there. There is no light at night, so I follow the river closely and find a place to sleep.\n\n\n\n--5/It doesn't matter anymore--\n\n\n\nI give up. I'm tired. I don't feel well. I want to be at home. I don't want to die alone.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n[[span style=\"color:#c4aead\"]]\n\nIt was quiet; Joey could only hear the river moving slowly. It had been his only constant this time\u2014water slowly moving across gravel and dirt. Water was moving constantly in an unseen direction. Joey took a deep breath and stretched out his legs, finding a smooth rock to sit on. Sitting, Joey thought about laying in the river and letting it carry him. He wondered where it went\u2014maybe a lake or grand ocean. He would never know, he thought. //I will die here//.\n\n\n\nHe had been walking for too long; everything was catching up to him. The exhaustion, only eating fruit, and the extreme. It was all building up, ready to crush and destroy him. Looking around, he took in his surroundings: the rushing water, the nine plains, and the bright standing light in the almost fake blue sky. //This is not the worst place to die, honestly//, Joey thought as he put his hands on his head; he had been appalled for the past few days. Joey understood well that his time was coming soon. //Should I get it over with? Do I go out on my terms?// That was the last thing Joey thought before the long silence was broken. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to be here,\u201d a loud voice spoke behind him.\n\n\n\nJoey's heart dropped as he looked in the direction of the voice. There, standing a few meters behind him, was the largest man he had ever seen. The man was unnaturally tall, maybe double Joey\u2019s height, with short silver hair pushed back, wearing silver robes with red lining. Bright silver earrings dangled with the wind, and over his right shoulder was one of the deer creatures Joey had seen. The tongue was sticking out and had a gash down its side.\n\n\n\n\"Sorry, little one, I didn't mean to startle you,\u201d the man spoke as he slowly put the animal carcass on the ground. \u201cYou look sick; are you alright?\u201d\n\n\n\nJoey's words were stuck in his throat; he didn't know if that was because of the man's physical nature or not having human contact for what felt like an eternity. The man looked down at Joey, tilted his head to the side, and nodded.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou seem like you need to eat. Here, I just caught this. I will make us something.\u201d He said this as he waved his hand, and as he did, bright silver particles spiraled around his writing. Then, a small silver fire was brought into existence with a spark.\n\n\n\nJoey's head began to spin as he attempted to stand up, but his head felt as if it were one hundred pounds. Joey leaned back and lost consciousness as he fell. The large man caught him.\n\n\n\nCrackling sounds filled Joey\u2019s head as he slowly regained consciousness. He sat up and put his hands on his head, squinting from pain. Then, in an instant, his memory reawakened, and Joey shot to his feet in a panic. In front of him was an unknown man sitting on a small rock with two large sticks in his hands. Each stick had a cooked piece of meat.\n\n\n\n\"Woah, now relax and be safe. I'm not going to hurt you.\"\n\n\n\n\u201cWho are you? What are you? Wha\u2026\u201d Joey began before he was cut off.\n\n\n\n\u201cEat first, questions after.\u201d The man said this as he leaned forward and handed Joey one of the sticks.\n\n\n\nJoey didn't have enough energy to argue or try to ask again. He took the stick from the man and sat down across from him. Looking at the meat, Joey pushed himself to take a bite. \"Oh yeah. This is what food tastes like,\" Joey thought as he felt tears welling up.\n\n\n\n\"That good, huh? I didn't even add anything to it,\u201d the man said, chuckling.\n\n\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Joey responded with a chunk of meat still in his mouth.\n\n\n\nThe man smiled and nodded. \u201cNow, kid, why are you here?\u201d\n\n\n\nThat question caught Joey off guard. He paused for a minute, thinking about how to answer that question.\n\n\n\n\u201cI don't know. I was walking home from school, and in a second, I was here. Wherever here is.\u201d Joey answered as he went for another bite of food.\n\n\n\nThe man looked at Joey, puzzled for a few seconds, until the expression changed to a face of realization, and a grin appeared.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo the barrier is that weak now. Interesting, that's good news.\u201d He said this, looking at Joey. \"You're too small for a human, aren't you? What's your name?\"\n\n\n\n\u201cMy name is Joey. Are you a bit big for a human?\"\n\n\n\nThe man laughed. \u201cWhat a strange name Joey is. You are not from here.\u201d\n\n\n\n\"What's your name?\u201d Joey asked.\n\n\n\nThe man paused for a minute. Then, he stood up.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy name is Silas. I'm the king of this wonderful land we are on.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cKing?\u201d Joey said, coughing.\n\n\n\nThe man looked confused as he scratched his head and stomped out the silver fire. Then, looking back at Joey, he looked him up and down and smiled again.\n\n\n\n\u201cCome with me, kid. I'll help you out,\u201d Silas said as he extended his large arm toward Joey.\n\n\n\n\u201cI will show you my kingdom.\u201d\n\n[[/span]]\n\n\n\n------\n\n[[span style=\"color:#c4aead\"]]\n\n\u201cWhat exactly are you, Silas?\u201d Joey asked, sitting on a floating platform of silver particles. \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean? I'm human, just like you. Unless you are not human?\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, I mean, you can do magic. That's not normal?\u201d Joey said.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat is magic?\u201d Silas responded.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe particles, the instant fire, you being ten feet tall. That has to be magic.\u201d Joey shot back.\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, are those things not every day for you? I can't imagine living in a place like that.\u201d\n\n\n\nJoey tried to wrap his head around what was going on. He wasn't thinking about it since he had not eaten real food for so long. But now that Joey was thinking about it, everything made less sense. He was sitting on a platform made of shining particles, floating alongside a man who was ten feet tall. With that given, somehow Joey felt no fear towards Silas as if he had known the man for a long time. \n\n\n\nLooking around, Joey took in his surroundings. He never saw the world's beauty since he had been terrified for the last few weeks. The forest Joey came from was unbelievable. The trees' height and size were excellent, and the leaves were a shade of green he didn't know existed. \n\nThe plains he was currently in were also breathtaking; the grass seemed so perfect that it couldn't be real. He felt the calmness of the river as it pierced through the plains like a dagger into the distance. He felt relaxed for the first time in what felt like an eternity. He felt as if he was finally safe. \n\n\n\n\u201cAh, there it is. Home.\u201d Silas announced as they stopped moving.\n\n\n\nJoey looked before him and was amazed at the sight that beheld him. It was an enormous city that shocked him in every aspect. Large buildings with intricate designs and large open spaces that reassembled outside theaters. Long roads and winding rivers ran through the city like veins. In the center of town was a building that was a combination of a cathedral and a castle. It had large banners dangling on the front that displayed the image of a spear through a book. It's incredible, Joey thought to himself as they entered the city. \n\n\n\n\u201cSo, little one, what do you think? Fantastical, right.\u201d Silas asked as he opened his arms to the city.\n\n\n\n\u201cI can't put it into words. This place is insane.\u201d Joey said, looking around.\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, it is. Welcome to The City of Stories, Fiert\u00e9.\u201d Silas said, looking back at Joey.\n\n\n\nSilas ushered to Joey and began walking towards the city's center. Joey couldn't help himself from being mesmerized by his surroundings. It was like he was walking in a fantasy story, a magical city filled with fantastic uniqueness. However, something odd caught his attention. The town was dead silent. The only sounds were the sound of the two of them walking. //Where is everyone? This city is vast. People should be everywhere. But there is not a sign of life anywhere.// Joey questioned himself as he stopped walking.\n\n\n\n\u201cSilas, where is everyone?\u201d Joey questioned.\n\n\n\nSilas stopped walking and took a look around. There was an uncomfortable pause, and then he spoke.\n\n\n\n\u201cDead. I am all that is left.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to bring up anything bad.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cNo, No, it's quite alright. It's because of my own doing. I have had time to mourn.\u201d Silas said as he began to walk.\n\n\n\n\u201cLet's get more food and new clothes at the town center.\u201d He said, ushering Joey once again. \n\n\n\n\u201cThis place used to be brimming with the brightest minds in this world. Hungry for the greatest tellings of adventures and tales. But now there is no one to share the telling of our world.\u201d \n\n\n\nSilas paused again and then waved his hands. Bright silver particles began to flow around them and take the shapes of people. The people were walking around the city as if doing their daily tasks. Some stopped talking to one another while others wrote in books. \n\n\n\n\u201cThis city used to be a city of history. A place solely focused on the past that we could never return to. Our job was to hold the history of our long-forgotten world and keep it safe in our grand libraries.\u201d He loudly spoke as he kept walking.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe old royal families held that duty for generations. They were so focused on the past because they believed there was no future to look forward to since the Grand Collapse. So we clung to the idea that the history of our ancestors would be enough will to keep living, enough will to keep dreaming. But they were wrong.\u201d Silas said, looking at the sky as if the memory had pained him. \n\n\n\n\u201cThen, one day, that old regime crumbled. What once was a city made for the past became a city for the future. The old regime was ripped from the throne, and a new Will sat on its throne. A will for the future that would be. A will to live, A will to dream. The once-dedicated historians became thrill seekers who sought out grand stories and legends from our fractured world. These people gathered stories of hunters seeking the monsters in the deep oceans and pilgrims claiming the islands burnt into the Sky. They hunted for tales of heroes who slayed the foulest creatures lurking in the deepest caverns. They scavenged for prophecies of future kings and queens. This is what Fiert\u00e9 is, a city of endless stories, the city of the future.\u201d Silas proclaimed as they approached the grand doors of the town center.\n\n\n\nSilas waved his hands, and the people he created vanished as the particles dissipated. They entered the enormous building. The first thing Joey noticed was the large empty bookshelves that layered the inside of it. Looking around, he felt the emptiness deep in his soul. He could tell that this place used to be many people's homes, sharing stories and spending time together. Now, it displays a graveyard of lost dreams. \n\n\n\nThey entered the second story and approached a hallway filled with doors. Silas opened the first door to the left and ushered Joey into it. It was a small room with a desk, bed, bookshelf, and closet. The closest was open and had silk robes hanging in it. \n\n\n\n\u201cMake yourself at home, kid. I will grab you when I have food ready for the both of us.\u201d Silas said as he headed out of the room.\n\n\n\n\u201cThank you for saving me, Silas.\u201d Joey quickly said.\n\n\n\nSilas stopped walking momentarily and waved his hand at Joey as if to signal it was all good. Joey wasted no time taking off his clothes and hopping into the new ones provided for him. The robes were silver with light gold lining; they were the most comfortable clothes he had ever worn. Joey sat on the bed and looked out the window; he fought back tears of happiness as he thought. //I am safe.//\n\n[[/span]]\n\n\n\n------\n\n[[span style=\"color:#c4aead\"]]\n\n\n\nStaring at the large platter of food in front of him, Joey almost felt himself cry again. Food has never looked so good before. It had a large piece of meat that looked perfect in every manner, a salad of unknown vegetables, and a pile of colorful fruit. Without much thought, Joey started to ravage the food as if he had never eaten in his life before. Every bite gave him more energy to eat more.\n\n\n\n\u201cSlow down there, kid, you are going to choke yourself,\u201d Sylas said, laughing as he joined Joey at the table. \n\n\n\n\u201cBut it is so good. I can't stop,\u201d Joey said with a mouthful of food. \n\n\n\n\u201cI'm glad you like it. I have had a lot of time to practice my cooking skills.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cSo, Joey, tell me about the place you come from. You seem to live in a place very different from my home.\u201d He asked Joey.\n\n\n\n\u201cHmm, where do you want me to start? Our worlds share many similarities; the plant and animal life are close. Yours are just a good size larger, though.\u201d Joey replied.\n\n\n\n\u201cReally? So everything there is smaller?\u201d\n\n\n\nJoey nodded as he swallowed a piece of meat.\n\n\u201cYeah, we also don't do magic. Or whatever you call that stuff you do with the particles.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cInteresting. So, how do you guys live then? How do you go places or fight the beasts of your world?\u201d\n\n\n\nJoey started to laugh as he put his fork down.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe use cars and planes to get places. And we don't have beasts, or at least not the ones you think of. \u201c\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat is a car? Is a plane a type of bird?\u201d Silas asked with a large amount of curiosity. \n\n\n\n\u201cI mean a giant metal bird that someone flies. A car is a machine that has four wheels and drives on the streets.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThis doesn't make any sense at all. Are you sure there is no? What did you call it, Magic, In your world.\u201d Sylas asked with a hint of disbelief.\n\n\n\n\u201cAh, man, you will need to see it for yourself. You will shit yourself visiting New York.\u201d Joey said, laughing.\n\n\n\n\u201cMaybe one day, the time will come when I can leave this prison. But for now, getting you back to your home will suffice.\u201d Silas said.\n\n\n\nJoey stopped laughing and looked at Silas. //Why does he keep calling this place a prison? It is a paradise.// \n\n\n\n\u201cYou are going to help me get back home? Really? Is it possible?\u201d Joey asked, leaning forward towards Silas.\n\n\n\n\u201cMaybe, I don't see why the Golden God wouldn't let you out. He has no issue with outsiders.\u201d\n\n\n\nJoey grinned ear to ear. He could go home. Then Joey stopped for a second. He wondered if he would like to return to his mediocre life of nothingness. //Maybe I should stay; Silas seems alone, and perhaps I can learn the magic he does.// Joey thought. \n\n\n\n\u201cI'll take you to the Golden Tower under one condition,\u201d Silas said, holding up his pointer figure.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd that is?\u201d Joey asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf we take the long route and have an adventure. I haven't spoken to anyone in years; I don't want to waste the opportunity to learn new stories.\u201d\n\n\n\nJoey stayed silent for a moment, thinking. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou have yourself a deal, Silas.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cWonderful. We will leave tomorrow morning. It will take us a very long time to reach the tower.\u201d Silas excitedly said. \n\n\n\n\u201cJust out of curiosity, how long does the fast route take?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cIf I flew you there, it would take about a day. But since we are going to walk about a full cycle.\u201d\n\n\n\n//Shit.//\n\n[[/span]]\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n[[span style=\"color:#c4aead\"]]\n\nFiddling with the new shoes he found in the room he slept in, Joey sat on the steps of the outside theater Silas told him to meet him at. //How far is this tower he talks about? Better yet, what the hell is a Golden God?// Joey thought as he turned to the footsteps behind him.\n\n\n\n\u201cGood morning, Joey. Are you ready for the adventure of your life?\u201d Silas said with a large grin. \n\n\n\n\u201cI think I have a few changes of clothes, but I couldn't make space for food,\u201d Joey responded, shuffling through his backpack. \n\n\n\n\u201cDon't worry about it. We will get food as we go along.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat statement made Joey raise an eyebrow. He thought this would probably be a mistake, but he had no choice. Then, a random thought came into Joey\u2019s mind.\n\n\n\n\u201cHey Silas, you never told me. How did you become king? I understand the old king was overthrown, but how did you become king?\u201d\n\n\n\nSilas began to laugh. He walked onto the stage and turned to face Joey.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat, my friend, is a story that to show than tell,\u201d Silas says as he raises his hands, and an enormous amount of silver particles fill the area.\n\n\n\nJoey\u2019s eyes widened as the particles slowly formed into a scene. He could make out the town center and a young man walking to the large doors.\u00a0\u00a0It took Joey a few seconds, but he knew that the young man was a younger Silas. \n\n\n\nThe younger Silas entered the hall and walked towards the center of the hall. The interior looked completely different from what Joey knew. It was closer to an actual castle, filled with banners and noblemen. In the back of the room was a man sitting on a throne. His crown on his head held an orange gem that glowed as bright as the sun. Upon seeing Silas, the man commanded everyone out of the building except for two guards beside his throne.\n\n\n\n\u201cKing Lotar of the Fire Soul, you pay for your crimes today!\u201d Silas yelled across the grand hall.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd what crime would that be, Silas? The killing of your father? He brought that upon himself, starting that silly revolution.\u201d Lotar replied, looking at his fingers uncaringly. \n\n\n\n\u201cNo, however, I will have my revenge for his death. No, your crime is holding this city in the past while the future is the only path!\u201d Silas retorted.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo your father has poisoned your mind as well. So be it. Guards, end this cursed bloodline so I can return to more pressing matters.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe two guards beside the king stood straight and slowly walked towards Silas. Both knights wielded swords and shields, carrying gem-embedded shields similar to the king's crown. They both slammed their swords into the shields and ignited their blades into a brilliant orange fire. Silas held his hands in response, and the familiar silver particles formed around his fingers. In an instant, one of the knights screamed out in pain as a large silver spear slammed into his chest, pinning him into the wall. The other knight tried to close the distance on Silas rapidly, but Silas was already ahead, swiping his hand and slicing the air before him. Particles shot out and slammed into the Knight, removing his upper torso and sending it flying off.\n\n\n\nKing Lotar shot to his feet with a face of confusion and anger.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat power. What did you do, Silas!?\u201d Lotar screamed as he approached Silas. \n\n\n\nSilas ignored the question, manifested a shining silver spear, and pointed at the king.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou die today. False King.\u201d Silas yelled.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo be it. You will join your father in the afterlife.\u201d Lotar replied.\n\n\n\nLotar held up his hands and clapped once. With a bright light, both of his arms are ignited in bright flames, illuminating the empty building. Without much pause, Lotar shot from the stairs leading to his throne towards Silas, catching Silas off guard and landing a swift punch into his chest. The punch throws Silas into the town hall's large doors; Silas tries to get his footing back but is swiftly sent back to the ground with a knee to the face.\n\n\n\nGrunting, Silas slams the ground, and a wall of silver spikes shoots from the ground, putting some distance between the two fighters. Lotar visibly smiled as he punched through the spikes and approached Silas again. Silas got to his feet, manifested two spears over his shoulders, and shot forward towards Lotar. Putting his fists together in a ball, Lotar prepared to slam the ground before them. However, Silas launched himself into the air with a sharp jump, shooting both spears directly at Lotar. Lotar held out his hands and caught both of the spears. Upon him grabbing them, they exploded into a million tiny silver spears. Piercing every inch of his body, Silas grabbed him by his left arm before he could react and swiftly landed three punches to the king's face. Silas then quickly manifested a small silver dagger and impaled Lotar in the lower gut; Lotar let out a small gasp as the air left his body. \n\n\n\n\u201cENOUGH!!\u201d Lotar screamed as the gem on his crown grew brighter.\n\n\n\nWith a bright flash, Lotar\u2019s entire body became engulfed in flames. Silas jumped back as fast as he could, just not fast enough. The blast of energy sent him shooting through the large entry doors of the town hall. Tumbling down the stairs to the town hall, Silas realized he was out in the open, and the city's citizens were staring at him.\n\n\n\n\u201cEveryone, get back now!\u201d Silas commanded, waving his hands at them. \n\n\n\nHe kept trying to wave people off and didn't notice the flaming hand approaching him rapidly. Lotar shoots his palm onto Silas' face and slams him straight to the ground. Silas could feel the heat of the flames slowly starting to burn his face. Panicking, Silas manifested five spears floating above them and, with a move of his finger, slammed them into Lotar. Blood shot out of Lotar\u2019s nose and mouth as he started to lose grip on Silas' face. Silas manifested another dagger with his other hand and slashed Lotar's arm clean off. Gasping, Silas scrambled back before getting to his feet. Lotar struggled to move but couldn't. The spears Silas manifested just a second ago, holding Lotar in place as blood poured down each of them.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat power\u2026 What god\u2026 did you sell your\u2026. soul for Silas?\u201d Lotar whispered as blood poured out of his mouth.\n\n\n\nSilas walked up to Lotar and manifested a long silver sword.\n\n\n\n\u201cI hate you for what you did to my father. I hate you to my core. But I have to thank you, Lotar. Thank you for being a part of my story.\u201d Silas said he had held up the sword. \n\n\n\nWith one quick motion, Silas decapitated the King. He knelt and picked up the crown that used to sit upon Lotar's head. Citizens of the city stood around, entirely still, staring at Silas. Silas then raised the crown into the air and crushed it. A bright orange light shone bright for a few seconds before fading away. Looking around at all the people's faces staring at him, Silas held up his hands to the sky. And let out a giant yell of triumph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoey sat there in awe as the particles began to fade. He could see Silas, the current Silas, seated on the edge of the stage. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI was a bit rusty back then with my powers. Made that fight a bit one-sided for a while.\u201d He said with a smile as he stood up and walked to Joey.\n\n\n\n\u201cDid that suffice enough for an answer?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAre you kidding me? That was fucking badass. You can do all of those things?\u201d Joey replied with excitement in his voice.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat was with that fire? Is that more magic? What exactly is your power? Joey asked as he also stood up.\n\n\n\n\u201cWoah, Woah, one at a time, Joey. I'll tell you all about that stuff during our adventure. I think it's time we head out now.\u201d Silas said as he walked past Joey.\n\n\n\nJoey nodded, picked up his backpack, and began following Silas out of the City of Stories.\n\n[[/span]]\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nI forgot I had this still deep in my backpack. I planned to recap what happened, but he beat me to it. I didn't see him write them, so I guess he used some of his magic. It seems like something he would write. It is in his style, loud, descriptive, and extravagant; some details are exaggerated, but that's fine. It kind of makes me happy he kept track of our meetings. It's been about a month now since I've been here. Now that I think about it, it's probably been longer. We have been walking for about two weeks now. \n\n\n\nSo, let's see what he missed writing about. Nothing really except for, you know, the whole other world stuff. This world is lovely, and it's just amazing. There is only nature. It's something I thought I would never see in my life. It may sound silly, but not hearing any form of civilization is weird. I'm so used to the sounds of cars, people, and everything. But being alone in this vast wilderness is almost enlightening. I just remembered Silas explains the world or whatever is left of it. There is Astralglade, which is where we currently are and where the Fiert\u00e9 is. Then there is the Grand Ocean Oarlenza. He also said that there used to be a floating city that lived above the sea. Then, more to the East is the continent of Drukal. He told me it was mainly inhabitable mountains and deep caves. And then lastly, in the center of it all, we are heading towards the Gold Tower. It's where the god that rules the land lives and my ticket out. \n\n\n\nWhat else happened? Silas and I have just been walking and talking about each other's life. I asked about his family. He would probably not mind if I talked about them here. Silas told me he didn't know his mother since she died giving birth to him, but he and his father were very close. He talks a lot about his father. It seems he left a very lasting effect on Silas. His father's name was Jean-Reylein, and he was the advisor to the now-dead king, Lotar. Jean-Reylein started the Revolt of Stories, and it seems that, like Silas, they both value the future more than the past. After a few protests and a large-scale revolt, Lotar had Jean-Reylein executed for his crimes.\n\nWhich pushed Silas to follow through with what his father had started. However, I feel like Silas had other motives to kill Lotar than just his father's death. He always talks about this Grand Story. He won't ever tell me what that means or why it's so important to him, but it seems very personal, so I don't want to keep asking. \n\n\n\nI wish I had a father like Jean-Reylein. From what Silas tells me about him, he was an overall caring man who wanted Silas to accomplish great things. A man who wanted the best for his city and the people he cared about. My father sees me as more of a burden; I have never really been good at much, so my father ignored me. He never got mad and never complimented him; to him, I was just in his life. Like I was something he was supposed to feed, clothe, and send off to school. I remember the time I got lost when we took a skiing trip; I fell into a ditch and lost one of my skis. It was cold, and I couldn't navigate through the forest. It had to have been an hour, then when I finally found my way to the bottom of the mountain, He was mad and thought I had run off. I told him I fell and got lost in the woods; he yelled at me and called me a lair. He said I was just a spoiled kid, and now he had to buy a new pair of skis. From that point on, I only really talked to him a little. I just didn't see him as family anymore.\n\n\n\nWell, I'm going to sleep now. We still have much walking to do until we reach the Golden Tower. From what I gather, it will probably be another nine to ten months of walking. This is incredible; I will live out my own story for once. My adventure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n------\n\n[[span style=\"color:#c4aead\"]]\n\n\n\n\u201cDo you think it will taste good?\u201d Joey asked, peering over the large mole-like creature Silas just killed.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo idea. I've never killed one of these before.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cReally? I'm surprised you wouldn't have gotten to everything by now.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, that's the thing, Joey. This creature isn't from here. I'm pretty sure it's from Drukal.\u201d Silas said, kneeling to the creature.\n\n\n\n\u201cThen why would it be here? Isn't that far from here?\u201d Joey questioned.\n\n\n\nA faint crack sounds behind them; Silas stops moving and stands utterly silent. Joey looked at Silas for a few seconds. \n\n\n\nConfused, Joey asked. \n\n\u201cWhy did you stop tal-\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cGet down, Joey!\u201d Silas yelled, reaching and pushing Joey to his knees.\n\n\n\nSounds of trees smashing to bits sound off as a large object swings fast over Joey's head. Before Joey could regain his bearings, he felt Silas grab harder on his shoulder and launch them out of the tree line. Joey noticed trees torn down as they landed in an open field next to the forest. Fuck, Was the only thought Joey\u2019s brain could muster.\n\n\n\nThe creature dragged itself out of the forest, its enormous body slamming against the surrounding trees as it did. It was a creature Joey thought could only exist in fantasy stories. It was a giant lizard covered in large brown scales closer to rocks than flesh. Its front two arms carried three large claws that shined like diamonds. The creature's back was covered in sharp spikes and one prominent ridge down its spine. Its tail was a weapon in itself; at the end of its tail was a large sphere bone piece. It's one eye was staring at Joey and Silas, unwavering in its goal.\n\n\n\nThe creature shot forward with speed that didn't match its hulking body mass. Silas reacted to the beast's aggression by grabbing Joey and jumping into the air. Joey felt his stomach drop as he rushed into the air by Silas, whose back now held four silver wings. Constructed of silver particles, the top two wings were grand with sharp edges and dropping particles. Meanwhile, the bottom two were much smaller and moved with the upper wings. Silas was holding on to Joey by the waist like a small handbag. \n\n\n\nThe creature opened its mouth and let out a high-pitched screech, obliterating the ground under them. Then, it looked up to Silas and Joey, hovering in the sky, opening its mouth wide again to send another screech. Silas raised his free hand and created four spears, and with the movement of his hand toward the beast, they shot forward with striking speed. The spears slammed into the creature's legs and tail, pinning them to the ground. It uttered a loud cry and moved its head to attempt to remove one of the spears with its mouth.\n\n\n\nSilas strengthens his grip on Joey.\n\n\u201cDon't let go, Joey.\u201d \n\n\n\nSilver particles began to form around Silas' feet, creating bright silver armored boots. Then his wings stretched to great lengths, and with a loud crack, he shot down towards the beast, slamming his foot into its head. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoey was sitting on a downed log, staring at the body of the beast Silas just killed. It happened so fast that he didn't understand what happened. He did feel sick for the amount Silas flung around him in the air. //Without Silas, I would have died a while ago. I forgot I am in a world I don't know, filled with things I don't understand. I got lost in the idea of it all.// Joey thought to himself as he noticed Silas fidgeting with the creature's head. \n\n\n\n\u201cThat was a bit too close for comfort. I'm stronger than the creatures here; however, you are not.\u201d Silas said as he began to open the creature's jaw. \n\n\n\n\u201cI mean, what would you have to do? That creature was the size of two school buses.\u201d Joey responded. \n\n\n\n\u201cI get that, but I can't protect you every waking hour, so I'm going to do something for you,\u201d Silas said as he ripped one of the large teeth from the beast's jaw.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis will be the first effigy of the future in years. I wonder if I can still do it.\u201d \n\n\n\nHe said as he held The white tooth in his hand. Silver particles began to flow around his hand and circled the tooth. Then, the particles completely enveloped the tooth and began to shine a bright silver glow. The particles immediately dissipated with a quick cracking noise, and in Silas's hand was something new. In his hand sat a dagger. The blade was the tooth of the beast sharpened and reinforced with a silver lining down the middle. The handle was a bright silver with white spaces about the length of it. \n\n\u00a0\n\nSilas walked over to Joey and flipped the dagger so the handle was facing Joey. Joey stared at the dagger for a bit. Just looking at it, he could tell something about it seemed off. It almost felt alive, he thought. Joey pushed past the feeling and grabbed the hilt, and the second his fingers wrapped around it, his mind traveled somewhere far. His surroundings completely changed in just a few seconds, floating in the empty universe. The stars and galaxies cracked with what seemed like beating, breathing veins of silver particles. They all blinked simultaneously, gripping the stars and universe at once. Then, as soon as it came, it was gone. He was back sitting on the log with the dagger in hand. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDid you see it, Joey?\u201d Silas asked, staring at Joey with a big smile.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat the actual fuck was that?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cAh, so you did, that\u2019s good. The dagger I made for you, Joey, is called an Effigy.\u201d Silas said as he pointed to the dagger in Joey's hand. \n\n\n\n\u201cEffigies are items that are given the blessings of a great Will. I created this one for you. What you saw when you held on to it was the Will itself. The will of the Future. My will is now yours. It is our will.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n[[/span]]\n\n------\n\n[[span style=\"color:#c4aead\"]]\n\nPushing the branch out of his face, Joey looked at the large boar creature grazing on the tall grass before him. He moved his hand toward his waist, where his dagger sat, and he slowly gripped the handle. Joey felt energy and excitement run through his body when his hands wrapped around the blade. With his free hand, he pushed himself forward from the bush in a fast motion, shooting forward faster than any human should be able to move. The giant boar saw him and squealed as it put its head down to prepare to charge.\u00a0\u00a0Joey raised his dagger and slashed in the air before him, sending a line of silver particles toward the boar. The slash collided with the boar and sent it into a tree; Joey planted his left foot into the ground to stop himself. He was going too fast, tripping over his feet and tumbling onto the ground. \n\n\n\n\u201cShit, I went too fast.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe enormous boar looked at Joey as it picked itself back up. It put its head back down and began to charge at Joey. He felt a bit of panic as he looked at the creature's four large horns on top of its head as it closed the distance between them. The boar was almost three times larger than him and looked twice as nasty. Its dark red fur is covered in scars and wounds, and the boar means to kill Joey. As it ran towards him, the ground tore as its large legs ripped through the terrain. Joey felt a deep sense of fear as it got closer. He couldn't form any honest thoughts, and I'm going to die. Joey thought to himself as his heart sank farther and farther into despair. He felt a twitch in his hand and looked at his dagger. Silver particles began to seep from the blade, and all the anguish and fear were instantly gone. He was in complete mental harmony as if something forcefully cleared his mind for him. A new wave of clarity moved his body for him. He put his dagger handle in his mouth and raised his hands out in front of him. The boar slammed itself into Joey. He grabbed two of the tusks on the boar's head. And with all his might, he raised the creature and threw it over his head. \n\n\n\nThe boar landed on its back and let out a grotesque squeal as it attempted to get back up. Throwing its body side to side, trying its hardest to return to its feet. A silver spear shot through the tree line and entered the beast's chest, finally silencing its cries. Joey Turned around as Silas walked into view, waving to Joey with a smile.\n\n\n\n\u201cDid you see that, Silas? I was fucking awesome!.\u201d \n\n\n\nSilas walked up to Joey and smiled even more.\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, you were amazing. You are a natural.\u201d Silas responded as he held out his hand.\n\n\n\nJoey reached up and high-fived Silas. \n\n\u201cI tried everything you told me to do. I panicked for a bit, but I figured it out in the end.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDid the Will help you? Did something reach out and help you?\u201d Silas said as he picked up the boar.\n\n\n\n\u201cEffigies are directly connected to the Will itself, so in times of need, it will seek you out and help your mind and body.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cSo, like the force?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat's that?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, I forgot. Never mind, ignore me.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoey stared into the dark sky as the fire crackled before him. Silas was cutting a piece of meat off the boar Joey killed earlier that day. They had eaten this type of animal before, but it tasted better since he was the one who got it for them. He had never felt so proud of himself, and Silas's praise made him feel even better. Joey finally thought he was doing things for gain, making his own story. It will be over soon, and the Golden Tower is close. He said to himself as he looked past the forest they were in. Their goal, The Golden Tower, was almost in grasp. Its bright, shining lite irradiated throughout the dark sky, the only sours of light in the dark sky. The tower climbs into the sky until it reaches its top, where the bright light that serves as the sun and the moon resides. The closer Joey looked at it, the grander it became. Each inch of the tower is marble with veins of beating gold lining it all. \n\n\n\n\u201cSilas, why is the tower the only light source here?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI thought I already told you?\u201d Silas responded, putting down his food.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou said something about a great destruction or something along that line. But not really into detail about it.\u201d \n\n\n\nSilas let out a sigh and strained his back. \n\n\n\n\u201cJoey, will you listen this time, please.\u201d\n\n\n\nSilas looked up to the night sky and began to speak.\n\n\n\n\u201cA few generations ago, there was something in our universe eating and devouring all existence. It was not a thing but more of the idea of destruction and eradication. The people of the time noticed stars and suns disappearing without a trace. It was almost too late when it was understood what was happening. Most of our world had already been devoured, leaving it in its current state.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cDid it just stop?\u201d Joey interrupted.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo, Joey, it didn't just stop. I'm getting to that if you can just wait.\u201d Silas responded before continuing. \n\n\n\n\u201cThe current Golden god of the time, Cailiem, used all the power the Will of The Cosmos had to summon the threat into a physical form. No texts or records of the physical form have been written down since most people at the time described it as indescribable. Cailiem killed the entity, and wanting to keep what remained of the world stable, he created two Effigies. One was the Golden Tower to stabilize the physical world; then, he created the Heart of the Cosmos to stabilize the intangible world. Doing this, he sacrificed most of Will\u2019s power, leaving him and the future generations of Golden gods weaker. However, the Will of The Cosmos is still the most potent force in this universe. \u201c\n\n\n\n\u201cWait, Wait, the tower is an Effigy?\u201d Joey asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat is your question? Not about the creature that ended the universe or the god that killed it. But is it an Effigy?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\n\nSilas let out a sigh. \n\n\u201cAnything can be an Effigy. As long as a Great Will attaches to it, it becomes an Effigy. There are even cases of humans becoming Effigies.\u201d Silas responded.\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, that's amazing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, it is Joey. Yes, it is.\u201d Silas said, pausing for a moment after.\n\n\n\n\u201cThank you for going on this journey with me, Joey. It's been years since I've been able to tell and hear stories. You don't know how much this means to me.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis statement caught Joey off guard.\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course. I mean, you are keeping me safe until I make it back home. Thank you, Silas.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cReally? I think you would have figured it out by yourself.\u201d Silas said.\n\n\n\nJoey let out a laugh. \n\n\n\n\u201cSilas, it's probably been over a year since we traveled together. When you found me at the river, I thought about giving up. You have kept me alive for this long. You have kept me company. You have taken me on an adventure of a lifetime. Silas, you are my friend.\u201d\n\n\n\nSilas smiled back at Joey.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou are my friend too, Joey.\u201d\n\n[[/span]]\n\n------\n\n\n\n[[span style=\"color:#c4aead\"]]\n\n\n\n\u201cSilas, What the fuck is that.\u201d\n\n\n\nBefore them stood a giant construct, a tall human-shaped machine. A grand creation standing three stories tall, built of bright white marble. The joints of the machine beat with bright gold particles that shined as bright as the light in the tower. Above its armored skull sat three bright gold halos hovering above. On its back was another large halo floating vertically behind it. The construct\u2019s one golden eye stared at Silas, unwavering and unmoving. \n\n\n\nJoey looked towards Silas and was surprised to see such an ugly expression. Silas looked like he was staring down the devil himself, and Joey could feel the hate and contempt. In the more than a year he has traveled with Silas, Silas has never shown any form of hate or anger towards anything.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat Joey Is my Warden. It's my punishment for my sins.\u201d Silas says, sitting down on a small rock.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis stain of power restricts me from leaving this empty city. It watches me as he sits there and rots, laughing at my misery.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSilas, what are you talking about? What sin?\u201d Joey asked carefully.\n\n\n\n\u201cSit down, Joey. I have one more story to tell you.\u201d\t\n\n\n\n\u201cAbout three years ago, I traveled the world and gathered the other Will holders to challenge the current Golden God.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy would you want to do that, Silas? Are they not the thing holding the universe together?\u201d\n\nJoey asked\n\n\n\n\u201cYou don't understand. I needed to challenge him. I needed to take him off that throne. I needed him to die for my story.\u201d \n\n\n\nSilas paused for a few seconds. Then he looked at Joey with a straight, unfeeling expression.\n\n\n\n\u201cFirst, I went to the country of mountains to meet with Olbier. Olbier did not take much convincing since he and his people worshipped an old god and did not respect the Will of the Cosmos. Olbier is the holder of the Will of Worship, a mighty warrior of unmatched physical strength. A man of protection and care for his people and his god.\u201d\n\n\n\nSilas looked west with an expression of sadness and disdain.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe did not deserve his fate,\u201d Silas said, looking back at Joey.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter that, I met with the queen of the Sky and the Prince of the deep. First, I met with the Prince, who denied me at every stage. That coward wanted nothing to do with becoming known throughout history. Maybe we would have won against that insect in the tower with him. The Queen initially was not for the idea of challenging the Golden God, but telling Morlaya that she could soar through the cosmos with no restrictions piqued her interest enough to agree. With those two backing me, we challenge the god.\u201d\n\n\n\nSilas\u2019s expression changed from uncaring to anger as he continued. \n\n\n\n\u201cWe climbed the tower and challenged that disgusting, arrogant bastard in his throne room. The Will of the Cosmos was not what it used to be, and his death should have been swift and easy. However, we underestimated him as much as he underestimated us. We hurt him gravely, and he now sits there waiting to draw his last breath on his throne. And for that, he punished us gravely. He tore the wings off of the Morlaya and sunk her and her sky city into the ocean she so despised. Then, he corrupted Olbier's mind, turning him into a raging marauder. Oblier, in a rage, went back to his country and murdered most of the people he swore to protect, turning the rest into rage-filled monsters bent on the death of everything that moves.\u201d \n\n\n\nSilas stood up, spoke angrily, and spit as he yelled. \n\n\n\n\u201cAnd for me, that disgusting fraud tore the memory of our grand battle from my head. He knew that I prized that more than my own life. He knew that I NEEDED THAT FOR MY STORY! HE KNEW I LOVED STORIES MORE THAN MY OWN LIFE. HE TOOK EVERYTHING FROM ME. HE ERASED ALL THE STORIES OF MY CITY AND ERASED ALL THE PEOPLE. HE MADE SURE I HAD NOTHING LEFT. THAT WAS HIS MISTAKE, I WILL NOT STOP FOR ANYTHING, MY STORY WILL BE COMPLETED. AND I WILL WATCH AS HE BLEEDS AND DIES IN HIS THRONE!\u201d\n\n\n\nJoey felt his heart sink as the man he had spent more than a year with became something that scared him. It was like he was staring at a new man. The Silas Joey has spent this time with would never act like this. He would never be this angry. He felt scared of him for the first time since Joey met Silas. This man was double his height, wielded magic, and could tear him limb from limb. In a world he did not understand, the reality of his situation started to hit Joey. He was in a place he didn't know with someone Joey thought he knew well. He wanted to run away from him for the first time since he met Silas. He wanted to go home. \n\n\n\n\u201cSorry about that, Joey. I just lose myself when I think about what HE took from me.\u201d Silas said, composing himself.\n\n\n\nJoey didn't know what to say and felt scared that anything he said would make Silas angry again.\n\n\n\n\u201cSilas, I don't understand. You challenged him, did you not? Why would you do that.\u201d\n\n\n\nSilas approached Joey and put one of his large hands on his shoulder. \n\n\n\n\u201cOh, my little Joey. You may not see it now. But when my story is complete, it will all make sense. It will make sense to you. It will make sense to that golden insect. It will make sense to the universe.\u201d Silas said with a look that made Joey frightened for his life. \n\n\n\nSilas then bent down on his knees and hugged Joey.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy dear friend. I will miss you dearly. But it is time for you to go back to your home. The warden will let you pass. There, the Golden God should let you leave. He has no quarry with you.\u201d\n\n\n\nSilas let go of Joey and stood back up. He pointed to a large set of stairs at the bottom of your tower.\n\n\n\n\u201cNow go, Joey, Finish your part of the story.\u201d \n\n\n\nMy part? Joey thought as he started to walk towards the tower. He walked past the warden, and it didn't budge or look at him. Its gaze stayed unmoving on Silas. Joey got to the first step of the stairs and looked back at Silas, who was still standing there staring at Joey. Joey took his first step, and a sharp feeling of distress shot through his body. He looked back and saw Silas now crying. \n\n\n\nJoey completely froze as a sense of pure dread felt through his body.\n\n\n\n\u201cThank you for being a part of my story, Joey.\u201d\n\n\n\n[[/span]]\n\n------\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n//Well, shit//. Alan thought as he put the tablet back on the table. That gave me more questions than answers. He took another sip of his coffee as he stood up and looked out the window towards the giant rift in reality. //What exactly am I looking at? The border of another universe dying and colliding with ours.//\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, Doctor, what do you think.\u201d Alan turned his head to look at Daughtry as he entered the room.\n\n\n\n\u201cHonestly, I don't know; I have more questions than answers right now,\u201d Alan said to Daughtry.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat's what I thought; this isn't our normal issue here. We are pretty much playing a waiting game with this.\u201d Daughtry said as he joined Alan at the table.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo I guess entity Silver is this King of Stories? Are there other things like that at the other Sites?\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cPretty much; the only reason we call it entity Silver is because its existence is unconfirmed. But I doubt it will stay like that for long. And yes, we are dealing with a slew of entities for which we are unprepared. But that's in our job description.\u201d Daughtry responded.\n\n\n\nAlan cracked a small smile and looked back out the window. It was hypnotizing, the idea and impossibility of it all. He never thought he would come face to face with something this unreal in his career at the Foundation. The sound of a walkie-talkie buzzing grabbed Alan\u2019s attention, and he turned to face Daughtry. Daughtry went to reach for the walkie-talkie, but as his hand held the device, both of them froze. A loud, earth-shattering cracking sound echoed everywhere around them. Alan put his hands over his head and went under the table, believing it to be some form of earthquake. \n\n\n\nAgent Daughtry tapped the top of the table and calmly sat up.\n\n\u201cDon't worry, that\u2019s normal. That means the rift is expanding.\u201d He said as he walked to the window.\n\n\n\nWithout warning, red lights and a blaring alarm rang through the site. Yelling and sprinting footsteps echo the hallways. Alan looks towards the window, seeing Agent Daughtry standing entirely still.\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, that is not normal.\u201d He says before he sprints out of the room, yelling something as he does.\n\n\n\nAlan sat under the table, not wanting to move; the alarm echoed through the room, and the thundering sound that the rift was making shook him to his core. //WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON//. Building the courage, Alan left the table's safety and headed towards the window. He grabbed the railing of it and pulled himself up to take a look outside. What he saw made his heart drop to the ground.\n\n\n\nThe rift wash was shaking violently, and bright silver particles were seeping through the cracks of the other universe. The loud cracking sound kept increasing as more particles shot through the rift. Large fingers could be seen slowly leaving the rift and grabbing the sides of the tear, slowly pulling the rift apart. The rift was torn inch by inch, creating a loud sound that brought Alan to his knees. Then, everything went silent, not even the downpour that had presided for hours. \n\n\n\nLooking out the window, Alan felt his soul leave his body. Standing in front of the rift was a man who had to be no shorter than ten feet tall with short silver hair and glistening earrings to match. There was no doubting it: this was Entity Silver, the King of Stories.\n\n[[span style=\"color:#c4aead\"]]\n\nSilas raised his arms out to the new sky in front of him. Free from the dying cage of his sins. Free from the eyes of the frail god that lay dying on his throne.
